Monica Geller: We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Chandler Bing: Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
Monica Geller: So, let's do this.
Chandler Bing: I - I don't think I can.
Monica Geller: Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
Chandler Bing: Because of Emma.
Monica Geller: Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Chandler Bing: Sorry.
Monica Geller: Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Chandler Bing: Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
Monica Geller: Canoodling?
Chandler Bing: Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Monica Geller: I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Chandler Bing: Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Monica Geller: I guess you're right.
Chandler Bing: You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Monica Geller: But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
