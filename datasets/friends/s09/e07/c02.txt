Chandler Bing: Hi!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Chandler Bing: How come?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Monica Geller: What do you do with your money now?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
Chandler Bing: Do you have any ideas?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
Monica Geller: Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." Or... or maybe just a wing or...
Monica Geller: Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
Joey Tribbiani: Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Monica Geller: Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Chandler Bing: Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Monica Geller: My dad told me. They play golf together.
Chandler Bing: Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
