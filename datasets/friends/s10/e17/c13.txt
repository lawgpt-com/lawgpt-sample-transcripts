Joey Tribbiani: Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
Chandler Bing: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Chandler Bing: Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Monica Geller: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Chandler Bing: Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Monica Geller: Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Chandler Bing: Alright.
Monica Geller: Oh God! What did I just step on?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh!
Chandler Bing: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Monica Geller: Oh..
Joey Tribbiani: You stepped on my egg roll?
Monica Geller: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Joey Tribbiani: Just put it on a plate and leave.
Chandler Bing: Okay, let's find these birds.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright.
Joey Tribbiani: Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! They're in the table!
Chandler Bing: Well, that can't be good!
Joey Tribbiani: We gotta get them out of there!
Chandler Bing: How?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Chandler Bing: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Chandler Bing: Joey, wait! The ball!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh God! So what do we do?
Chandler Bing: I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay.
Chandler Bing: No... It's all glued together.
Joey Tribbiani: Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Chandler Bing: I don't know. Maybe.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God!
Chandler Bing: I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
Chandler Bing: Did that movie ever get made?
Joey Tribbiani: It did not.
