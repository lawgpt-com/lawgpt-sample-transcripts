Monica Geller: Hey, you guys.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Monica Geller: Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Rachel Green: Monica, what are you doing?
Monica Geller: Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Phoebe Buffay: I guess it was kinda funny.
Monica Geller: It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Phoebe Buffay: Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Monica Geller: That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Phoebe Buffay: No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Rachel Green: Well, people are different.
Phoebe Buffay: Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Rachel Green: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Rachel Green: Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Monica Geller: You start working on that list.

Monica Geller: All right.
