Phoebe Buffay: Hey you guys, guess what?
Chandler Bing: The British are coming?
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
#ALL#: Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Chandler Bing: Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Monica Geller: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Joey Tribbiani: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Rachel Green: Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Danny: Hey guys.
#ALL#: Hey Danny.
Monica Geller: Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Rachel Green: Thanks, Mon.
Danny: Well, of course.
Monica Geller: Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Rachel Green: Monica!!!
Danny: Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Monica Geller: Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Danny: On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Rachel Green: Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
