Chandler Bing: Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Monica Geller: Hey, I thought you already had one.
Chandler Bing: Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Rachel Green: Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Chandler Bing: Okay, good luck with that.
Rachel Green: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hi!
Rachel Green: What's up?!
Monica Geller: What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Rachel Green: Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Monica Geller: Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Rachel Green: Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Monica Geller: Okay. Umm...
Rachel Green: Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Monica Geller: Okay, what's going on with you?
Rachel Green: Nothing! You go!
Monica Geller: Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Rachel Green: Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Monica Geller: Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Rachel Green: No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
