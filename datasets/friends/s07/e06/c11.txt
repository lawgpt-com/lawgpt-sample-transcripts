Chandler Bing: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Monica Geller: Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Chandler Bing: I would really love it if could do both.
Monica Geller: All right, I...I have to ask.
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler Bing: What?!
Monica Geller: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Chandler Bing: A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica Geller: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Chandler Bing: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Monica Geller: Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Chandler Bing: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica Geller: How?
Chandler Bing: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica Geller: What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Chandler Bing: Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Monica Geller: Keep going.
Chandler Bing: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Monica Geller: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Chandler Bing: I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Monica Geller: I love you.
Chandler Bing: Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
