Monica Geller: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
David: Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
Monica Geller: See?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Monica Geller: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Phoebe Buffay: Mike?? Who's Mike?
David: Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
Phoebe Buffay: That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
David: It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Phoebe Buffay: Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Chandler Bing: She does?
Monica Geller: Let's get you out of here!!
Monica Geller: At least you took me down with you!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Monica Geller: I guess, in time.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Monica Geller: I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Phoebe Buffay: You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
