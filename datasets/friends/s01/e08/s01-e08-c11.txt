Monica Geller: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Judy Geller: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.

Judy Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Monica Geller: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Judy Geller: Tell her what?
Monica Geller: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Judy Geller: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Monica Geller: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Judy Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Monica Geller: Huh.
