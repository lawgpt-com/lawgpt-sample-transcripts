Monica Geller: Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Chandler Bing: Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Monica Geller: Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Chandler Bing: I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Monica Geller: Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Chandler Bing: Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Chandler Bing: Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Monica Geller: So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
