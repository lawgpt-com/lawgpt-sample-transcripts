Chandler Bing: 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Chandler Bing: Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Joey Tribbiani: It's 4:30.
Chandler Bing: Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, I see what's going on here.
Chandler Bing: You-you do?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Chandler Bing: You got me.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Chandler Bing: Yeah. Right.
Joey Tribbiani: Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Chandler Bing: Okay.
