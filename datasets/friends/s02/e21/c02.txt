Big Bully: Hey you're in our seats.
Ross Geller: Oh, sorry we didn't know.
Little Bully: Hey, we were sitting there.
Chandler Bing: Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Little Bully: Is that supposed to be funny?
Chandler Bing: No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Big Bully: What's with this guy?
Little Bully: What's with you?
Ross Geller: Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Chandler Bing: What just happened?
Little Bully: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
Chandler Bing: That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Little Bully: No.
Chandler Bing: No?
Big Bully: No.
Ross Geller: Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Big Bully: Why should we?
Ross Geller: Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Chandler Bing: Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Big Bully: You got a problem with that?
Chandler Bing: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
