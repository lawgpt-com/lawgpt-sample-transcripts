Peter Becker: Hey, can I ask you something?
Monica Geller: Sure.
Peter Becker: Where are we?
Monica Geller: Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Peter Becker: Just tell me the truth.
Monica Geller: Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Peter Becker: Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Monica Geller: So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Peter Becker: Oh, yeah. I know that.
Monica Geller: I so wanna be attracted to you.
Peter Becker: But you're not. Okay, good.
Monica Geller: I'm sorry.
Peter Becker: Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
Monica Geller: It's not?
Peter Becker: I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Monica Geller: Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Peter Becker: Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
Spokeswoman: And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Peter Becker: One second.
