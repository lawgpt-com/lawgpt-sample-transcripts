Monica Geller: Hi honey!
Chandler Bing: Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Monica Geller: Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Zack: You too.
Chandler Bing: You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Monica Geller: I got it.
Zack: Thanks.
Chandler Bing: So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Monica Geller: Yeah, I guess.
Chandler Bing: So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Monica Geller: Excuse me?
Chandler Bing: Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Monica Geller: Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Chandler Bing: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Monica Geller: Chandler!
Chandler Bing: I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Monica Geller: I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Chandler Bing: Ok!
Monica Geller: Uh!
Chandler Bing: Zack!
Zack: Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
Monica Geller: Tell me about yourself, Zack!
