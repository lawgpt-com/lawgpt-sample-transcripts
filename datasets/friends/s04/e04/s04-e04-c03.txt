Joey Tribbiani: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Rachel Green: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Monica Geller: Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Rachel Green: That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Joey Tribbiani: All right that's it, school is in session!
Monica Geller: My God! Is this a gym card?
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
Ross Geller: So why don't you quit?
Chandler Bing: You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Ross Geller: Who is Maria?
Chandler Bing: Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Ross Geller: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Chandler Bing: No!
Ross Geller: So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Chandler Bing: Oh no, you'll have to come.
