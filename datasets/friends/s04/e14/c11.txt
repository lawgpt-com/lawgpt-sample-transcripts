Chandler Bing: All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Phoebe Buffay: I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Chandler Bing: Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Monica Geller: Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Chandler Bing: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!

Rachel Green: No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Chandler Bing: What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
