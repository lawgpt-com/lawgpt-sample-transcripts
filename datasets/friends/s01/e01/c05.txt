Monica Geller: Oh my God!
Paul the Wine Guy: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?

Monica Geller: -leg?
Paul the Wine Guy: That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Monica Geller: You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Paul the Wine Guy: Ooh, steer clear of you.
Monica Geller: That's right.
