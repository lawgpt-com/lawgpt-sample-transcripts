Ross Geller: Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
Rachel Green: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Ross Geller: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Rachel Green: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Ross Geller: Okay, shoot!
Rachel Green: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Ross Geller: OH NO!
Rachel Green: What? What is it?
Ross Geller: Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Rachel Green: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Ross Geller: Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Rachel Green: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Ross Geller: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Rachel Green: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Ross Geller: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?

Ross Geller: Duh, you think?
