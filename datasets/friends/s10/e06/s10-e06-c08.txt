Chandler Bing: Hey Joe!
Joey Tribbiani: What's up?
Chandler Bing: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.

Chandler Bing: I'm sorry man.
Joey Tribbiani: But, ehm... you watched the tape?
Chandler Bing: Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
Joey Tribbiani: You didn't watch the tape.
Chandler Bing: What!? Of course I did!

Chandler Bing: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, you lied again!
Chandler Bing: I watched it!
