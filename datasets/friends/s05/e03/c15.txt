Chandler Bing: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica Geller: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Chandler Bing: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Monica Geller: I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler Bing: Really? Okay, so...
Monica Geller: Know when to stop.
Chandler Bing: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Monica Geller: Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Chandler Bing: Right!
