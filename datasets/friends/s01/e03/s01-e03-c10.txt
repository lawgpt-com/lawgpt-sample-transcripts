Monica Geller: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Paula: No.
Monica Geller: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Monica Geller: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Paula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Monica Geller: I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Paula: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Monica Geller: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
