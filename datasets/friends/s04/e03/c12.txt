Joey Tribbiani: Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
The Salesman: Well ah, what can you swing?
Joey Tribbiani: How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
The Salesman: You don't have, anything?
Joey Tribbiani: You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
The Salesman: Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
Joey Tribbiani: And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
