Chandler Bing: I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Ross Geller: All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Chandler Bing: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Ross Geller: Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Kathy: Hey you guys!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Kathy: Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Ross Geller: Oh, absolutely!
Kathy: Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?

Kathy: It's a good play, isn't it?
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Ross Geller: Okay, I...
Kathy: Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Chandler Bing: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Kathy: Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Chandler Bing: Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Kathy: Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Chandler Bing: Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Kathy: Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Chandler Bing: Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Kathy: I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
