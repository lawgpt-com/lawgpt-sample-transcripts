Monica Geller: Hi.
Richard Burke: Hi.
Monica Geller: I don't know why I'm here.
Richard Burke: I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
Monica Geller: I don't know.
Richard Burke: Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Monica Geller: Chandler is such an idiot!
Richard Burke: Drink?
Monica Geller: Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Richard Burke: ...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Monica Geller: Still smoking cigars?
Richard Burke: Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
Monica Geller: No that's, that's okay.
Richard Burke: So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Monica Geller: Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Richard Burke: Oh really?
Monica Geller: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Richard Burke: Who is it?
Monica Geller: Edward Nevski?
Richard Burke: Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
Monica Geller: No.
Richard Burke: Ahh.
Monica Geller: But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
