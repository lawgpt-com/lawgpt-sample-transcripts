Ross Geller: Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Joey Tribbiani: No.
Ross Geller: Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Ross Geller: Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Gunther: Here you go.
Ross Geller: Oh.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Ross Geller: All the time?
Joey Tribbiani: All the time!
