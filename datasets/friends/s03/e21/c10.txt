Phoebe Buffay: But I can't tell you.
Monica Geller: Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Monica Geller: Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Monica Geller: Does it have to do with Joey?
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Monica Geller: Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
