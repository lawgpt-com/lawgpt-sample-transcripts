Joey Tribbiani: Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Ross Geller: Really? That's great!
Joey Tribbiani: I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Carol Willick: Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Ross Geller: Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Joey Tribbiani: That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Ross Geller: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Joey Tribbiani: I look more like him than you do!
Carol Willick: Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
