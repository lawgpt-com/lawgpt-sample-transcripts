Monica Geller: We were just waxing our legs.
Chandler Bing: Off?!!
Phoebe Buffay: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah, come here.
Chandler Bing: Oh, that's mature.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh.

Monica Geller: Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!

Ross Geller: I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Rachel Green: Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Rachel Green: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Rachel Green: We were on a break!
Ross Geller: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Rachel Green: You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Ross Geller: Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Rachel Green: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Monica Geller: What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Joey Tribbiani: Why not?! I'm hungry.
Monica Geller: Because they'll know we've been listening.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Ross Geller: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Rachel Green: Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, we'll be fine.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
unknown: nan
Phoebe Buffay: Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Rachel Green: All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Ross Geller: Yes I would.
Rachel Green: You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Ross Geller: Yes.
Rachel Green: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Ross Geller: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
unknown: nan
#ALL#: Ohhhhh!

Ross Geller: Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
unknown: nan
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
Phoebe Buffay: We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Chandler Bing: Oh great, food with hair on it.
Phoebe Buffay: No, not the used wax.
Chandler Bing: Because that would be crazy?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Rachel Green: Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Ross Geller: No anchovies.
Rachel Green: With ah, extra anchovies.
Ross Geller: That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Rachel Green: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: You can have the last piece, if you want.
Rachel Green: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
unknown: nan
Phoebe Buffay: They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Monica Geller: What if they don't?
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: You think I need a new walk?
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Chandler Bing: Are you actually saying these words?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Monica Geller: Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Rachel Green: That's....
Ross Geller: That's what?!
Rachel Green: That is neither here nor there.
Ross Geller: Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Ross Geller: Okay, okay, okay.
Rachel Green: I think you should go.
Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: I really think you need to go now.
Ross Geller: Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Rachel Green: Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Ross Geller: Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Rachel Green: No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: Then how come it is?
