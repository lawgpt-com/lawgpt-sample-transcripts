Rachel Green: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Monica Geller: Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Rachel Green: Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Monica Geller: Um-hmm.
Rachel Green: What am I making him by the way?
Monica Geller: Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Rachel Green: I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Monica Geller: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Rachel Green: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
