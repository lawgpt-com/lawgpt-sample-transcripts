Chandler Bing: I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Andrea Waltham: Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Andrea Waltham: Who is this?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Andrea Waltham: Where did you get this number?
Phoebe Buffay: I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Andrea Waltham: Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Andrea Waltham: Oh, am I on the radio?
Phoebe Buffay: No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Andrea Waltham: No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Chandler Bing: And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
