Rachel Green: I mean, this is unbelievable.
Phoebe Buffay: I know. This is really, really huge.
Chandler Bing: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe Buffay: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Chandler Bing: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica Geller: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Rachel Green: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Rachel Green: Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
Chandler Bing: H-He's in China!
Joey Tribbiani: The country.
Monica Geller: No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Chandler Bing: What about the time difference?
Monica Geller: From here to the airport?
Chandler Bing: Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Monica Geller: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel Green: I-I-I don't know.
Chandler Bing: Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Joey Tribbiani: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Monica Geller: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Rachel Green: I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe Buffay: Here, look, alright, does this help?
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
Chandler Bing: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
