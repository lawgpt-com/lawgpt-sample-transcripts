Rachel Green: You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Ross Geller: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Rachel Green: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.

Ross Geller: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Rachel Green: Um. yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: I am soo dead.
Rachel Green: All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Ross Geller: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Rachel Green: Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Ross Geller: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Rachel Green: Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Ross Geller: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Rachel Green: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Ross Geller: Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
