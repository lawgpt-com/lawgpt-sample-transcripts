Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: What's going on?
Chandler Bing: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Monica Geller: We?
Chandler Bing: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Chandler Bing: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Monica Geller: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Chandler Bing: Little people?
Joey Tribbiani: Celebrity.
Monica Geller: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Chandler Bing: What...? NO!
Monica Geller: Chandler?
Chandler Bing: I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Monica Geller: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Chandler Bing: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
Monica Geller: It isn't mine!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
