Chandler Bing: Hey! What are you guys doing?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Monica Geller: Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry, who?
Monica Geller: I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Chandler Bing: But we don't know the neighbors.
Joey Tribbiani: I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Monica Geller: See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Chandler Bing: Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Rachel Green: Gooood morning!!
Chandler Bing: Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Rachel Green: Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Monica Geller: Where you can make out with your assistant.
Rachel Green: Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Monica Geller: Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Rachel Green: We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Monica Geller: Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Rachel Green: Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Monica Geller: Did you two...
Rachel Green: Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Monica Geller: Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Rachel Green: Anymore!!
Monica Geller: Okay.
