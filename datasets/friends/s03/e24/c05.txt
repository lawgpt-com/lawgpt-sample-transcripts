Hoshi: You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Peter Becker: I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
Hoshi: It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Monica Geller: Hi!
Peter Becker: Monica! Hi honey.
Hoshi: All right, on the table.
Monica Geller: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Peter Becker: Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Monica Geller: Promise me you'll be careful.
Peter Becker: I promise.
Monica Geller: Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Peter Becker: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Hoshi: No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Monica Geller: How 'bout just a boom?
