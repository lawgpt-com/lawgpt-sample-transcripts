Monica Geller: Hey honey! I missed you today!
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah?
Monica Geller: Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
Chandler Bing: Oh, well... Maybe we could...
Monica Geller: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Chandler Bing: We really need to take those tests?
Monica Geller: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Chandler Bing: But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Monica Geller: What is the big deal?
Chandler Bing: It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Monica Geller: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Chandler Bing: I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Monica Geller: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Monica Geller: OH!
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
