Joey Tribbiani: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
Chandler Bing: That's patio furniture!
Joey Tribbiani: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Chandler Bing: What about the birds?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Chandler Bing: You pick one.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, how about the ladybugs?
Chandler Bing: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Joey Tribbiani: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Chandler Bing: Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
