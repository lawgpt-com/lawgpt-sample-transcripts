Monica Geller: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey.
Rachel Green: Hi!
Monica Geller: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Rachel Green: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross Geller: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Rachel Green: Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, "That will open up a can of worms."
Monica Geller: Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Ross Geller: It's sex.
Monica Geller: Do it!
Ross Geller: Monica!
Monica Geller: I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
Monica Geller: All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
Ross Geller: Monica, what is the matter with you?
Monica Geller: Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Rachel Green: Why? Why today?
Monica Geller: Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
Ross Geller: What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
Rachel Green: I'll take that bet.
Ross Geller: What?!
Rachel Green: Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
Ross Geller: Can I get some of that action?
Monica Geller: Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
Rachel Green: Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
Monica Geller: Oh, okay!
