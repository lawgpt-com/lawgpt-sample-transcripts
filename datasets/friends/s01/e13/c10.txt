Joey Tribbiani: Ma! What're you doing here?
Gloria Tribbiani: I came to give you this and this.
Joey Tribbiani: Oww! Big ring!
Gloria Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Joey Tribbiani: Hold on, you-you knew?
Gloria Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Joey Tribbiani: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Gloria Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Joey Tribbiani: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Gloria Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm...happy...for you?
Gloria Tribbiani: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Joey Tribbiani: Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Gloria Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Gloria Tribbiani: That's sweet. Could I take her?
Joey Tribbiani: With this ring? No contest.
