Monica Geller: Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Monica Geller: I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Chandler Bing: 'Kay!

Joey Tribbiani: Can I ask you something?
Chandler Bing: Uhh, no.
Joey Tribbiani: Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Chandler Bing: No.
Joey Tribbiani: I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Chandler Bing: Yes.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks man.
Chandler Bing: Okay man.
Joey Tribbiani: But what about how much taller he is than me?
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?

Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Monica Geller: I know!
Joey Tribbiani: Had the beef-tips, huh?
