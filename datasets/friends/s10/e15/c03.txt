Mr. Zelner: May I help you?
Ross Geller: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
Mr. Zelner: Oh right, uhm, Don?
Ross Geller: Close. Ron.
Mr. Zelner: Uh... What can I do for you?
Ross Geller: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Mr. Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
Ross Geller: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Mr. Zelner: Wow, that is tempting.
Ross Geller: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
Mr. Zelner: She is good!
Ross Geller: Huh, I took a shot there.
Mr. Zelner: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Ross Geller: I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
Mr. Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
Ross Geller: Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Mr. Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
Ross Geller: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!
Mr. Zelner: You can really arrange that?
Ross Geller: You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
Mr. Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Ross Geller: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Mr. Zelner: That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
Ross Geller: He'll be fine.
