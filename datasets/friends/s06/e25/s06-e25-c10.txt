Monica Geller: I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Richard Burke: Excuse me?
Monica Geller: Oh! Him.
Richard Burke: Oh. Whew!
Monica Geller: I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Richard Burke: Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Monica Geller: Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Richard Burke: I think that's fair.
Monica Geller: Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Richard Burke: It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Monica Geller: Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
Richard Burke: I know.
Monica Geller: Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Richard Burke: Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
