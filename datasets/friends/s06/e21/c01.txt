Chandler Bing: Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Joey Tribbiani: Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Phoebe Buffay: No! Joey, you're going to be great!
Joey Tribbiani: But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Monica Geller: I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Phoebe Buffay: I'll be waiting.
