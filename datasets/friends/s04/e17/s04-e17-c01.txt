Mr. Treeger: Ohhh, man!!
Joey Tribbiani: What is that?

Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Chandler Bing: Do we pay for this?
Joey Tribbiani: No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Chandler Bing: Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Mr. Treeger: Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Mr. Treeger: Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Chandler Bing: Like finding money with naked people on it!
Mr. Treeger: Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Joey Tribbiani: Why would he turn off the TV?
