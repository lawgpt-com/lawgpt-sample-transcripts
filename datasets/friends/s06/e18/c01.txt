Ross Geller: Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Chandler Bing: Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Rachel Green: Who wrote it?
Ross Geller: Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Chandler Bing: A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Rachel Green: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Ross Geller: It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Chandler Bing: Oh, is that against the rules?
Ross Geller: No, but it is frowned upon.
Chandler Bing: I see.
Ross Geller: Besides, there's a big age difference.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Ross Geller: I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Joey Tribbiani: No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
