Monica Geller: Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I'm hearing.
Monica Geller: I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Monica Geller: Or! A bakery delivery person.
Phoebe Buffay: I wa-I wa-I wa...
Monica Geller: Pizza?!
Phoebe Buffay: Monica!
Monica Geller: All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Monica Geller: Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Monica Geller: Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Phoebe Buffay: Really?! Are you sure?
Monica Geller: Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Monica Geller: Really?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Monica Geller: Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay: Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
