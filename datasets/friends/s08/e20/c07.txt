Rachel Green: So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Sandra Green: Of course I am!
Rachel Green: Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Sandra Green: No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
Rachel Green: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Sandra Green: I'm going to the bathroom.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Sandra Green: Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.
Monica Geller: It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Ross Geller: I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Phoebe Buffay: Not if you were here.
Ross Geller: Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Rachel Green: Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Ross Geller: A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Rachel Green: No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Ross Geller: Uh, what?
Rachel Green: Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Ross Geller: What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
Sandra Green: Hi Ross!
Ross Geller: Hi roomie!
