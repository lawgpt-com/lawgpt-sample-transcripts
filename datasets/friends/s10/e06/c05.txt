Chandler Bing: Hey you guys.
Rachel Green: Hi!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Chandler Bing: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
Joey Tribbiani: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Rachel Green: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Chandler Bing: Joe...
Joey Tribbiani: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Chandler Bing: Fine!
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you.
Chandler Bing: Work, Joe!
Joey Tribbiani: Damn it!
Chandler Bing: What am I gonna do now?
Joey Tribbiani: Just pass it to your boss!
Chandler Bing: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
Rachel Green: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Chandler Bing: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
