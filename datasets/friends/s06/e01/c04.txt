Monica Geller: So, what do you think we should do?
Chandler Bing: I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Monica Geller: I know I love you!
Chandler Bing: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Monica Geller: That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Chandler Bing: Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Monica Geller: All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Chandler Bing: Sounds great.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Croupler: Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Monica Geller: Ready?
Chandler Bing: Ready!
Monica Geller: Come on eight.
Chandler Bing: Yes, yes eight.

Croupler: Eight! Easy eight.
Monica Geller: Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Chandler Bing: That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Monica Geller: Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Chandler Bing: That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Monica Geller: I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Chandler Bing: Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Monica Geller: Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
