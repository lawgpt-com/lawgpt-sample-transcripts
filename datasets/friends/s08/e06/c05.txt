Phoebe Buffay: Hi liar!
Ursula Buffay: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Ursula Buffay: Well they could be true.
Phoebe Buffay: But they're not!
Ursula Buffay: Yeah, it's a fine line huh?
Phoebe Buffay: Why are you lying to him?
Ursula Buffay: I don't know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
Eric: Honey?
Ursula Buffay: It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
Eric: She's helped so many people to quit smoking.
Ursula Buffay: Y'know, we'd really better get going.
Eric: Oh right, you've got a church group meeting tonight.
Ursula Buffay: Right.
Eric: Well, it was nice meeting you.
Phoebe Buffay: You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!

Ross Geller: So, you gettin' tired?
Chandler Bing: Nope! I can do this all day.
Ross Geller: Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
Chandler Bing: God, I'm exhausted.
Ross Geller: Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Chandler Bing: No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Ross Geller: Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
Chandler Bing: You're Spudnik.
Ross Geller: Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
Chandler Bing: Fine. Oh no!
Ross Geller: Oh yeah!
Mona: Yay! My hero!
Joey Tribbiani: You're a weird lady.
Eric: Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Eric: What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
Phoebe Buffay: Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Eric: Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Eric: I think we'll be okay. Besides it's so perfect and she's been saving herself for me.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
Eric: What?
Phoebe Buffay: She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
Eric: She told me she was 25.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger.
Eric: I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
Phoebe Buffay: No. You're not, you're not stupid.
Eric: I'm not smart. I just wanted so much to...be impulsive once. To be romantic.
Phoebe Buffay: That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
Eric: It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Ursula Buffay: Eric!! Let's go!!
Eric: I'd better go, deal...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, you should.
Ursula Buffay: Hurry up I gotta pray!!

Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
Joey Tribbiani: That's not so bad.
Rachel Green: No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
Joey Tribbiani: Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Rachel Green: Really? You think that's all it is?
Joey Tribbiani: Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
