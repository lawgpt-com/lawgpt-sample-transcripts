Mona: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
Mona: Good.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Mona: I brought you back a present.
Ross Geller: Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
Mona: I think it's interesting.
Ross Geller: I do too! I missed you!
Mona: I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
Ross Geller: Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
Mona: How exciting!
Ross Geller: Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
Mona: Oh no.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Mona: Yeah right!
Ross Geller: What?
Mona: Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!'
Ross Geller: Huh...uh-huh.
Mona: Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!

Mona: So, what'd you tell him?
Ross Geller: Just a second!
