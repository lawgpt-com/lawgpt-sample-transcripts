Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Chandler Bing: Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

Chandler Bing: I could fall asleep at a play.
Phoebe Buffay: What is it?
Joey Tribbiani: It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
Monica Geller: It sounds interesting!
Ross Geller: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
Phoebe Buffay: I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Joey Tribbiani: You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Ross Geller: What? How come that you don't have to go!
Joey Tribbiani: I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.

Rachel Green: Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, here you go.
Rachel Green: Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Monica Geller: No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Rachel Green: No reason.
Monica Geller: No, no, Rachel?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Who do you wanna fool around with?
Rachel Green: Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Monica Geller: You can't!
Rachel Green: Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Monica Geller: In the hall.
