Monica Geller: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Ethan: I just had sex.
Monica Geller: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Ethan: Well, you never told me how old you were.
Monica Geller: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Ethan: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Monica Geller: Don't say it.
Ethan: ...in love with you.
Monica Geller: Really?
Ethan: Sorry.
Monica Geller: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
