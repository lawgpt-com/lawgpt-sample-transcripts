Mike Hannigan: Hello?
Monica Geller: Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Mike Hannigan: Who is this?
Monica Geller: This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Mike Hannigan: He... he's gonna propose?
Monica Geller: I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
Mike Hannigan: Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
Monica Geller: You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
Monica Geller: Well, I hope you're happy!
Chandler Bing: Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Monica Geller: Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Chandler Bing: Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Monica Geller: No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Chandler Bing: And there's not chance that will work?
Monica Geller: No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Chandler Bing: Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica Geller: Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Chandler Bing: This vacation sucks!!
