Monica Geller: I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Chandler Bing: I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Monica Geller: Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Chandler Bing: Right here!
Monica Geller: Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Chandler Bing: Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Monica Geller: It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Monica Geller: I know! I know.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, did she buy it?
Chandler Bing: Totally.
Phoebe Buffay: So did Heldi show you the place?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, it's beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay: I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Chandler Bing: I know.
