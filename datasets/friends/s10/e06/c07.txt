Phoebe Buffay: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Monica Geller: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Phoebe Buffay: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
Monica Geller: Wow, what's the bad news!
Rachel Green: Who's Gladys?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
Rachel Green: Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Monica Geller: Huh!
Rachel Green: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Monica Geller: You know, I would give her up, for you.
Rachel Green: No, I couldn't let you do that.
Monica Geller: But I want to.
Rachel Green: But I don't want you to.
Monica Geller: But I insist!
Rachel Green: But I insist harder!
Phoebe Buffay: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!
Monica Geller: No, that landed in your food!
Rachel Green: No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
