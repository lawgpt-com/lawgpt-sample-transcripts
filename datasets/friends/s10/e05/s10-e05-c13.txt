Phoebe Buffay: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
Mike Hannigan: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
Phoebe Buffay: I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
Phoebe Buffay: It's in the cake, isn't it?
Mike Hannigan: Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
Phoebe Buffay: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Mike Hannigan: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Mike Hannigan: I'm gonna do this now.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God!
Mike Hannigan: Phoebe, I...
Phoebe Buffay: Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Mike Hannigan: Ready?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh!
Mike Hannigan: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes!
Mike Hannigan: I love you!
Phoebe Buffay: I love you more!
Mike Hannigan: Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
