Rachel Green: Hi. I'm back.
Paul Stevens: Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Rachel Green: Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Paul Stevens: Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
Rachel Green: A lover?
Paul Stevens: A surfer.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah surfer?
Paul Stevens: I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Rachel Green: Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
Paul Stevens: No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Rachel Green: I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Paul Stevens: What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Rachel Green: Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Paul Stevens: Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Rachel Green: I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Paul Stevens: I would really like that.
