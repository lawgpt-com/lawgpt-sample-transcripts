THE COURT:

-- program or plan.

So, I’m happy to

3

go forward with the hearing.

4

motion and the exhibits and support the objections by the

5

U.S. Trustee and the so-called nonconsenting states, the Ad

6

Hoc Group of Nonconsenting States, more formally, and the

7

Debtor’s reply with the exhibits.

8

MR. VONNEGUT:

9
10

I’ve reviewed the original

Thank you, Your Honor.

For the

record, this is Eli Vonnegut of Davis Polk & Wardwell on
behalf of the Debtors.

Can you hear me clearly?

11

THE COURT:

Yes, and see you.

12

MR. VONNEGUT:

Thank you very much, Your Honor.

13

So, correct, we do have only one time on the agenda today

14

but it’s a very important one.

15

motion filed June 28th at Docket 3077.

16

The Debtor’s 2021 KERP

Your Honor, we are -- we’re nearing the end of

17

these cases and are slated to commence our plan confirmation

18

hearing in about a week and a half on August 9th.

19

for the Debtors plan continues to build.

20

through the agreement of 15 of the 24 members of the

21

nonconsenting states group to support the Debtors proposed

22

plan and settlement.

23

with the assistance of Judge Chapman as our mediator, for

24

which we are all extremely grateful.

25

Support

Most notably,

This latest milestone was achieved

The goal of the plan and the goal of this entire

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 7
1

proceeding is to put all of the estate’s value to work

2

helping creditors and fighting the (indiscernible) crisis.

3

That’s what we commend this bankruptcy to do.

4

of the value of the enterprise is critical in order to

5

achieve that goal and we can’t do that without preserving

6

the workforce.

7

Preservation

In designing the 2021 KERP, frankly, our goal was

8

to be as boring as we possibly could because we want the

9

company’s employees focused on running the business, and we

10

want creditor focused on getting this company out of

11

bankruptcy.

12

into the 2020 programs that were approved by the Court, and

13

so for 2021, we structured the KERP to mimic last year’s

14

program with changes limited to those caused by ordinary

15

course base salary increases and promotions.

16

A tremendous amount of time and energy went

As is reflected in the declaration submitted by

17

Josephine Gartrell of Willis Towers, marketing positioning

18

for the program stayed consistent with last year.

19

because this is now the third time we’ve done this in this

20

case, nothing has changed in our methodology for identifying

21

insiders, nobody has taken issue with our method for doing

22

that.

23

And

Since the initial filing of the motion, the

24

Debtors have engaged with our creditors, as we always do,

25

chiefly to ensure that the plans align both with the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 8
1

company’s immediate needs but also with the post-emergence

2

plans of the public creditor that will be our residual

3

stakeholder of the plan.

4

Happily, as we noted in the reply we filed

5

yesterday, we’ve reached agreement with the Ad Hoc

6

Committee, the MSGE Group and the UCC to make certain

7

modifications to the proposed KERP and to delay the hearing

8

on the KEIP until August 19th, which we are hoping will be

9

the tail end of our confirmation hearing.

10

I’ll turn to the objections momentarily but first

11

I want to briefly outline the proposed 2021 KERP, including

12

the changes that we agreed to with our creditors.

13

program includes the same three elements as the 2020 program

14

in similar amounts.

15

million total.

16

The long-term award is approximately $6 million, down from

17

6.1 in 2020.

18

approximately $7.2 million in total, down from 8.1 in 2020.

19

The 2021

The annual award is approximately $16.1

That’s lower than 17.2 million from 2020.

And the targeted retention payments are

In working with the creditors, we agreed to a

20

couple pretty straightforward changes to the program.

21

first, the proportion of the annual award paid in October

22

2021 was reduced form half for all participants, to one-

23

third for employees below VP and one-quarter for VPs and

24

above, with the balance to be paid in March of 2022.

25

long-term award is no longer going to be subject to

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

So,

The

acceleration at emergence.

2

subject to a claw-back through March of 2024.

3

That will be paid in June 2022,

And, lastly, instead (indiscernible) paid in the

4

fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, the

5

targeted retention payments will be paid 25 percent around

6

December 30 of this year, 25 percent on March 30 of next

7

year, and 50 percent on June 30 of next year.

8

provisions having been incorporated into the program, the Ad

9

Hoc Committee, the MSGE Group and the UCC do not object to

10

With those

the KERP.

11

THE COURT:

Can I -- can I interrupt you?

I

12

thought none of the awards under the amended program would

13

be subject to acceleration upon emerging from bankruptcy.

14

MR. VONNEGUT:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

I

15

didn’t mean to suggest that the other ones would accelerate

16

at emergence.

17

THE COURT:

Okay.

18

MR. VONNEGUT:

All right.

Great.

So, before turning to the

19

objections, I’d just like to give a little bit of context

20

for what the company’s dealing with currently and why this

21

program is so important.

22

As we noted in our motion, the claw-back period

23

for the 2020 annual award expired on June 30th.

24

worried going into this about losing people in July and we

25

were right to be worried.

212-267-6868

We were

The Debtors lost 17 people in

July so far, compared to an average of five in July from

2

2018 to 2020.

3

attrition in less than a month.

4

discussing this program with creditors, we kept having to go

5

back to them every few days to update our attrition

6

statistics because resignations just kept coming.

7

That’s more than an entire quarter’s worth of
During July, when we were

To keep the workforce in place and preserve the

8

value and stability of the business so that we could

9

distribute that value to our creditors we need to be able to

10

give our employees comfort that they will be fairly

11

compensated.

12

is not really a bonus in the sense of extra compensation but

13

it’s an expected part of our employees’ annual compensation

14

and we can’t ask the workforce to hold tight and wait for

15

decisions about their pay for the work they’re doing right

16

now to be made in the future.

17

Your Honor has noted in the past that the KERP

We delayed consideration of the KERP this year as

18

long as we did to try to avoid disrupting the ongoing

19

mediation and, frankly, the company suffered for it.

20

Putting the KERP in place now to provide employees with

21

certainty is critical to stemming the attrition that’s going

22

on.

23

Now, with that context on the table, I should

24

first deal with housekeeping and then I’d like to turn to

25

the objections that we did receive.

212-267-6868

Court have any questions.

not right.

question to ask you about them and I’d like to swear you in.

2

So, do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole

3

truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

4

MR. LOWNE:

I do.

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

Let me turn to the first

declaration, the June declaration.

7

your direct testimony in this proceeding, is there anything

8

in it besides the description of the KERP program that has

9

been changed, as reflected in the reply, that you would like

to alter?

11

MR. LOWNE:

Nothing to be altered other than the

12

updates we gave on the attrition rates and the resignations

13

that were previously stated.

14

THE COURT:

Okay.

And with regard to that, let me

15

focus on the July 28th declaration.

I appreciate that was

16

just yesterday but is there anything in it, knowing that it

17

would be your direct testimony, that you wish to change?

18

MR. LOWNE:

Nothing to change, no.

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

20

And does anyone want to cross-

examine Mr. Lowne on either of his declarations?

21

MR. HIGGINS:

Your Honor, this is Ben Higgins for

22

the U.S. Trustee, I’m filling in for Mr. Schwartzberg today.

23

We don’t intend to cross-examine but there were some

24

conversations in connection with Lowne’s supplemental

25

declaration between Debtor’s counsel, Mr. Troop, and myself

And, Mr. Troop, I see you.

I think

you’re nodding there.

I was trying to get

THE COURT:

Okay, very well.

I don’t have any

16

questions of your, Mr. Lowne, so you can go off the screen

17

and consider yourself no longer testifying.

18

MR. LOWNE:

Thank you.

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

And then let me then ask Ms.

20

Gartrell to come on the screen.

21

you raise your right hand, please?

22

to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the

23

truth, so help you God?

MS. GARTRELL:

THE COURT:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

So, Ms. Gartrell, you also

5

dated June 28, 2021.

6

Mr. Lowne.

7

declaration would be your direct testimony in this matter,

8

is there anything in it that you would wish to change, other

9

than the description of the KERP plan that the Debtors are

10

presently seeking to have approval of, that were described

11

in their reply?

I’ll ask you the same question I asked

Sitting here today and knowing that that

MS. GARTRELL:

13

THE COURT:

14

Okay.

Does anyone want to cross-

examine Ms. Gartrell?

15

MR. VONNEGUT:

16

THE COURT:

17

No, no other changes, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor, thanks.

Okay.

And that was a no from Mr.

Troop, too?

18

MR. TROOP:

It was a no for me.

19

THE COURT:

All right.

I did have one question

20

for you, Ms. Gartrell.

I want to make sure I’m clear on the

chart on page 23 of your declaration.

paragraph, please?

THE COURT:

4

MS. GARTRELL:

5

Your Honor, could you reference the

48 and it’s table 7.
Okay, great.

Thank you.

Okay, I’m

there.

6

THE COURT:

Okay.

So, paragraph 48 says, the

7

aggregate market positioning is shown in table 7 below.

8

you see that?

9

MS. GARTRELL:

10

THE COURT:

Do

Yes, I do.

So, I just want to make sure I

11

understand.

12

-- what is the market that you’re looking at here?

13

-- the first column is Employee Group and you have Non-

14

insider (Executive Survey) and then below that you have Non-

15

insider (Middle Management and Professional Survey).

16

what is the -- what is the group you’re comparing the

17

Debtors’ KERP participants to?

18

When you say aggregate market positioning, who

MS. GARTRELL:

You have

So,

Sorry, Your Honor, that is the

19

Willis Towers lots in 2020 pharma survey that we used last

20

year as well.

21

executives as well as middle management and professional,

which is a leveling exercise for that -- from that

23

perspective.

24

market TDC, Total Direct Compensation Opportunities, among

25

all those different measurements.

212-267-6868

And so it splits out the employee groups into

And then we look at the variants of -- to

516-608-2400

Page 16

median, 75th percentile.

3

THE COURT:

Okay, so it’s comparing the pharma

group competitors, in essence, to the Debtors for personnel?

4

MS. GARTRELL:

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

6

of compensation, right?

7

MS. GARTRELL:

8

THE COURT:

9
10

That’s correct.
And this is -- this is a review

This is not a cost review?
That’s correct.

It’s just comparing the

characteristics of the KERP participants or the proposed
KERP participants’ compensation versus the competitors?

11

MS. GARTRELL:

12

THE COURT:

That’s correct.

Okay.

SO, the next column, as you

13

noted, has three sub-columns in it:

14

gather is 25th percentile, 50th percentile and 75th

15

percentile, right?

16

MS. GARTRELL:

17

THE COURT:

P25, P50, P75, which I

That’s correct.

And it says, variance to market TDC.

18

And then in parentheses it says, "Purdue Target TDC".

And I

19

just want to make sure I understand what those two phrases

20

mean.

21

designation?

When you say TDC, what do you mean with that

22

MS. GARTRELL:

So, when we’re talking about market

23

TDC in our surveys, that reflects base salary, target annual

24

incentive, bonus opportunities, as well as target long-term

25

incentives.

212-267-6868

And here we’re comparing, when we say Purdue

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 17
1

target TDC, because we don’t have typical TDC in practice

2

during bankruptcy, that is specifically comparing the base

3

salaries plus the KERP without the targeted retention

4

amounts, as well as the discounted L-trip award

5

opportunities.

6

they fall, you know, in the two different cuts of the survey

7

group.

8
9
10

And then it shows, compared to market, where

THE COURT:

Okay.

So, when we have Purdue Target

TDC here, it’s everything other than the third aspect of the
KERP, which is the target retention payments?

11

MS. GARTRELL:

That’s correct.

And then that’s

12

reflected -- all of those amounts are reflected in the

13

second set of columns for transparency purposes.

14

THE COURT:

Right.

And that -- and the only

15

difference there is the parenthetical that says, Perdue TDC

16

plus retention?

17

MS. GARTRELL:

18

THE COURT:

Correct.

Okay.

And when it says market TDC in

19

both of those columns, do they -- does that include any

20

retention component similar --

21

MS. GARTRELL:

22

THE COURT:

23

-- similar to the one in the KERP

that’s included in that third column?

No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

Okay.

But since we don’t have

Is it the case that those

normal pharma companies, competitor companies, don’t have a

10

separate element of compensation, i.e., sort of a reserve

11

fund to pay important people or key people, rather, who

12

might otherwise leave?

13

MS. GARTRELL:

No, certainly companies have

14

retention programs, it’s just that they’re not typically

15

reflected in the total target direct compensation data that

16

would be reflected in, you know, retention plan or severance

17

plan data.

18

could be used as tools to retain people or -- or offer them

severance opportunities.

20

traditional elements of pay in bankruptcy, our methodology

21

is to show the Court and all constituents all elements of

22

pay and tools that are available to this company in

23

bankruptcy, as compared to their market for talent which is

24

ongoing non-bankruptcy pharmaceutical companies in this

25

case.

212-267-6868

So, there are many other elements of pay that

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, how would you know then

2

that other companies do have -- or do use a separate tool

3

for retention, namely, you know, an amount that they set

4

aside to pay people that they don’t want to leave and feel

5

that they would otherwise leave?

6

MS. GARTRELL:

A few ways I know that, Your Honor.

One, I do retention programs for companies that are not in

bankruptcy on a regular basis.

Willis Towers Watson also
And so just

10

based on my experience, I know that we have -- that

11

companies do utilize retention and other tools to maintain

12

their workforce.

13

THE COURT:

Okay.

So, just walking through the

14

chart then, it appears to me that, based on the data you’ve

15

used, at the midlevel, the 50 percent level, the Purdue

16

target TDC is slightly over the market, right?

17

percent and 11 percent, respectively?

18

MS. GARTRELL:

That’s correct.

Eight

Although I would

19

add that, from a methodology perspective, when we’re

20

comparing total direct compensation to the market, we would

21

consider a competitive range to be 50, being plus or minus

22

20 percent.

23

variance to market TDC, looking at Purdue’s proposed

24

compensation programs plus base salary, would be within the

25

competitive range of (indiscernible) 50 of medium.

212-267-6868

So, in our nomenclature we would say that the

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 20

THE COURT:

Okay.

And then when you get to the

2

next column, at least for the 41 covered in the non-insider

3

executive survey, it seems to be outside of that range.

4

It’s 39 percent, whereas the middle management is 16

5

percent, which is in that range.

6

The reason I was asking you the questions about

7

what was included in the market TDC and whether they had --

8

those competitors also have a similar -- or regularly use

9

the type of retention payment that is covered by the third

10

aspect of the KERP proposal, i.e., the target retention

11

awards -- is to lead up to this question, which is in your

12

experience, are those competitor’s target retention awards

13

similar to, greater than, less than the proposed component

14

for these Debtors?

15

MS. GARTRELL:

I would say that they’re similar

16

to, but I would also add that retention is very

17

differentiated based on a company’s needs.

18

you could have a set of a senior leadership team whereby,

19

you know, certain of them are leveled -- they have a

20

different level of criticality than others, as determined by

21

the CEO, the board, or some manager.

22

highly differentiated.

23

So, for example,

And so they could be

But I would add that I don’t think that what the

company is proposing here is out of the ordinary in any way,

25

shape, or form.

fund?

4

MS. GARTRELL:

The size of the

Yes, the size -- when we compare

5

this cost per person here, you would see in a different

6

table that we’re actually lower than I believe the 25th

percentile compared to market.

8

cost per person on average is not excessive either.

9

THE COURT:

So, I don’t think -- the

And, again, this -- your

10

answers to the last couple of questions that I had, that’s

11

based on your own experience advising other companies on

their compensation structure?

13

MS. GARTRELL:

That’s correct.

That’s correct,

and very current experience, Your Honor, because we have a

market for talent whereby it’s very difficult to keep people

in the workforce at this moment in time.

looking at the cost of the KERP as a percentage of revenue

10

the non-insider executive survey, which is the smaller

12

- it’s outside of the range on 50 -- at the 50th percentile,

13

and 10 percent over the range at the 75th percentile;

14

although her testimony was also to the effect that the TDC

15

of the market, to which this was being compared, actually

didn’t include any specifically targeted retention payment

pool, which she said was in line with, in her experience, on

One last question on this.

-- a compensation program for 2021.

This is a

10

essentially for the past work, right?

11

you will, or the repositioning of Perdue, if it emerges

12

after confirmation, the confirmation hearing, is really to

13

happen in the future as opposed to 2021.

14

the point I think -- one of the points the Debtors are

15

making.

16

MR. TROOP:

So, the resizing, if

At least that’s

Your Honor, and I do understand that.

17

But the very purpose and structure, particularly the changes

(indiscernible) is to incent retention through 2022.

19

So, while it is compensation for current services, it really

20

is focused on retention, not this year, but for at least

21

half of next.

22

THE COURT:

Right?

But isn’t that, in essence, to give

23

the Debtors, the organized Debtors, optionality?

24

the committee made this point for the 2020 compensation

25

structure, that they wanted to have it be more retentive so

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

I mean,

516-608-2400

that you get more value as the company than have it be less

are stretched out over more time.

5

You can still terminate

And 2022 wouldn’t have been set.

MR. TROOP:

But if you terminate them with this

MR. TROOP:

Right.

But the optionality is to keep

it around until 2022 --

Are you still hearing feedback?

MR. TROOP:

I am, Your Honor.

I was trying to

Can I ask Mr. Vonnegut and Mr. Higgins

Everyone else, I think,

ARTHUR:

THE COURT:

All right, so maybe that’ll work.

MR. TROOP:

Thank you.

16

Yeah.

Hopefully.

17

So, Your Honor, we’ve had

18

one meaningful changes since we were last before you on the

19

KERP.

20

one of your observations was that there were no facts before

21

you with regard to the company’s wrongdoing or ill conduct.

22

And within weeks of that hearing, the company pled guilty to

23

felonies spanning ten years.

When you last approved the KERP in September of 2020,

That changes the marketplace.

the attorney generals in the nonconsenting states uniformly

2

believe that it is not only appropriate but good management

3

for this company to confirm that the people that they have

4

in their employ have not improperly contributed to improper

5

conduct by Purdue.

6

And what we found out since then is, well, Your

7

Honor, that to our knowledge, no one’s been fired, no one’s

8

been reprimanded, no one didn’t get a bonus because of any

9

participation either in the commission of the crimes that

10

have been pled to or otherwise with regard to improper

11

conduct over (indiscernible) period of time.

12

important issue for the attorney generals in the

13

nonconsenting states.

14

And that is an

It’s not an answer, frankly, as they Debtors did

15

in their reply.

16

whatever data we had received from the company, and where I

17

was able to identify seven or some -- a number of people

18

that we wanted them to look into, and they provided us some

information about those people.

And what we went through last time, we took

We understand that there were many

And, finally, Your Honor, it’s not a touchstone

24

that individuals weren’t indicted or did not themselves

25

plead guilty as part of the DOJ pool because we --

Page 35

THE COURT:

I don’t think the Debtors are

2

suggesting that that’s the cutoff, though.

3

that they’ve made that argument.

4

Let me cut to the chase.

I don’t think

I understand your point

5

as a general matter.

And I think while the Debtors clearly

6

were more than willing to work with your clients, and the

7

committee, and the other states to address any individual

8

questions that they had based on what they did have

9

information on -- and I don’t think you’d dispute that

10

because there was the carve-out for the eight people and the

11

like -- it’s true, they know more than you know,

12

notwithstanding all the discovery and disclosure, etc.

13

On the other hand, the -- I’m looking at the

14

actual language because, you know, when you have a -- a

15

right to money which can be taken away, you really do need

16

to have -- I think generally, unless someone’s being

17

retained at a much higher level than these people are --

18

clarity as to how it can be taken away.

19

And the order that was in place for 2020 and which

20

the debtors are proposing to replicate with regard to this

21

motion -- well, I'll read paragraph 9 of their proposed

22

order.

23

It says, "Any 2021 KERP participant" -- the old

24

order said 2020 KERP participant -- "to the extent that any

25

2021 KERP participant is determined by a final order of this

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 36
1

Court or any court of competent jurisdiction to have, a)

2

knowingly participated in any criminal misconduct in

3

connection with his or her employment with the debtors, or,

4

b) been aware, other than from public sources, of acts of

5

omissions of others that such participant knew at the time

6

were fraudulent or criminal with respect to the company's

7

commercial practices in connection with the sale of opioids

8

and failed to report such fraudulent or criminal acts or

9

omissions internally at the company or to law enforcement

10

authorities at any time during his or her employment with

11

the company shall not be eligible to receive any payments

12

approved by this order," and then all parties rights, if

13

any, to seek disgorgement following the entry of final order

14

are reserved.

15

So that's pretty clear standard to follow, and I

16

think your point raises two separate points.

17

proposed in the objection is a different standard, and then

18

secondly, you want to debtors to actually confirm that they

19

have done their own due diligence on whatever standard is in

20

the order, included it will be, a minimum, the one that the

21

debtors have proposed.

22

You want them to -- the debtors to perform their own due

23

diligence, and separate, you want to have to have a slightly

24

different -- not slightly -- a different standard for not

25

being eligible for the payment.

212-267-6868

One is, what's

It's two separate points, right.

Is that fair?

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

They're two

516-608-2400

Page 37
1

separate points?

2

MR. TROOP:

Your Honor, I think that, with regard

3

to the standard point, I would be prepared to say we could

4

live with the standard as articulated in the prior order --

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

6

MR. TROOP:

-- but we do agree that it's time for

7

the debtors to step up and do their diligence.

8
9

All right.

THE COURT:

Okay.

Good.

sure we knew what was at issue here.

I just wanted to make
And, frankly, I

10

understand the second point.

11

think any company should do that, and it's important to Mr.

12

Vonnegut should address because my inclination is to agree

13

with you on that point, that the debtors should represent

14

that they will undertake to determine whether any of the

15

recipients of the 2021 KERP fall into one of these

16

categories.

17

I think that's important.

I

Now I appreciate it says, "final order," but I

18

think if they at least think that someone is in that

19

position, my guess is -- my -- not guess -- my inclination

20

is that they should be treated like the eight people that

21

you inquired about -- you and others inquired about -- with

22

the 2020.

23

can't just be excluded with any inquiry, an explanation, et

24

cetera, but at least there should be some mechanism for

25

review if they -- if the debtors reasonably conclude that

212-267-6868

I mean, obviously there's due process.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

They

516-608-2400

Page 38
1

someone might fall into either category A or category B in

2

that paragraph 9.

3

MR. TROOP:

Your Honor, that would be satisfactory

4

on this point (indiscernible).

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

So I think

6

that -- is that -- that's your conclusion for your remarks,

7

Mr. Troop?

8
9

MR. TROOP:

I have one more that's more of a

housekeeping detail that I can save for the end, Your Honor,

10

so that Mr. Vonnegut can talk (indiscernible) in specifics

11

now in order, if that's okay.

12

THE COURT:

Well, okay.

If it's not -- it's

13

really not that material, it's just clean up, that's fine.

14

Okay.

15

don't you respond to that point we just covered first as far

16

as the debtors performing their own due diligence here and

17

building in a mechanism for that and that hold back to

18

review further if someone falls into one of those two

19

categories.

All right.

20

Okay.

MR. VONNEGUT:

Mr. Vonnegut, do you have -- why

Sure.

Thank you, Your Honor.

So

21

the most important point on this one is that I have learned

22

from dealing with this subject matter that it's very

23

delicate and that I have to be very careful.

24

line, I'm going to need to consult the company's counsel

25

that has been addressing the DOJ investigations and the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And so bottom

516-608-2400

Page 39
1

investigations by the state attorneys general.

2

Just to give an example to explain what I'm

3

talking about, there is a provision in our agreement with

4

the Department of Justice that says, effectively, the

5

company cannot stand up and publicly and proclaim its own

6

innocence.

7

is able to do in light of both the concluded investigation

8

and the terms of our agreement with the Department of

9

Justice.

And so there are limitations on what the company

And so one of the difficulties that we had,

10

frankly, in our discussions with Mr. Troop and others on the

11

side of the nonconsenting states is, they will ask for

12

public declarations that we explain we are not able to make,

13

given all of the different intersecting investigations.

14

I very much understand the Court's concern and

15

what you're looking for, but these are very serious matters.

16

I don't want to wing it, and so I think I will need to

17

consult with our criminal law experts and revert.

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

Although it would seem to me

19

one could draft this in a way where the debtors are not -- I

20

think what you're concerned about is that by implication if

21

the debtors identify someone -- and I'm assuming it's

22

identifying it internally and to the person but not making a

23

public declaration about it, although during the course of

24

this case, parties and interest might well have the ability

25

to question you about that --

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 40
1

MR. VONNEGUT:

2

THE COURT:

Yes --

-- but I think what you're concerned

3

about, though, is that by implication, if you haven't

4

identified anyone, you're asserting somehow the debtor's

5

innocence.

6

that's not really -- I think everyone understands that's not

7

what this exercise is about.

8

don't mean it's an empty exercise.

9

But I don't think that's what it's about.

I think that can be drafted around.

I think

And when I say "exercise," I
It's a serious exercise.
It's not about

10

the debtors saying, you know, we are innocent.

11

saying that someone who is still working for us and eligible

12

for this payment really shouldn't get it.

13

Now there may be --

14

MR. VONNEGUT:

15

THE COURT:

It's about

Yeah --

-- there may be other concerns in your

16

agreements with the Department of Justice and individual

17

attorneys general in connection with investigations, and

18

clearly, there are definitely employment law concerns as to

19

how you go about taking actions for cause.

20

both of those things.

21

around -- I mean, you can draft consistent with that.

22

there's a fundamental point which is, these programs already

23

recognize that you don't get the KERP if you're terminated

24

for cause so to me, if someone has engaged in the type of

25

activity described in either A or B of paragraph 9 that

212-267-6868

I understand

And again, I think you can draft

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

But

516-608-2400

Page 41
1

would -- in my view, I guess, be grounds for cause.

2

Now you have to have a --

3

MR. VONNEGUT:

4

THE COURT:

Yes, you -- Your Honor --

-- you have to have a program that

5

complies with employment law in airing -- you know, in

6

raising those issues and dealing with them, and I'm not

7

intending to prescribe how you do that.

8

say, consistent with, you know, applicable non-bankruptcy

9

law pertaining to employment matters and any agreements with

10

law enforcement agencies.

11

one that should be recognized.

12

MR. VONNEGUT:

The language would

would be fired.

perspective is that these are serious and important matters

and we need to get the language exactly right.

I want to be very careful about exactly

I think the point from the company's

That's,

It's really -- I think the

516-608-2400

Page 42

change would be an affirmative undertaking by the debtors to

on points A and B.

MR. VONNEGUT:

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. VONNEGUT:

Understood, Your Honor.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

I will just briefly address

7

the other commercial points that were raised by the two

8

objectors.

9

Your Honor.

10

I don't think there's a ton to discuss there,

So with respect to the timing of the program, this

notion that we are approving the programs early is just not

right.

what they were going to be paid in the first quarter of the

14

year.

16

couldn't get court approval until after we filed for

17

bankruptcy.

Historically, employees of the company were told

not the normal practice to ask people to work the whole year

the right idea.

the question of when in a year its programs are approved.

6

I think that's exactly the right way to look at

With respect to the idea that the new board should

7

be involved in compensation for 2021, frankly, I think Your

8

Honor picked up on many of the exact same (indiscernible)

9

that I was going to raise.

Fundamentally, they're at the

10

same timing (indiscernible) that if you want the new board

11

to opine on these programs, the new board doesn't exist yet,

12

and they're not going to be able to do it for quite some

13

time so you're going to be asking the work force to accept a

14

lot of risk and we think that would be damaging to the

15

enterprise.

16

It's also just not normal course to ask boards for

17

reorganized companies to approve compensation for periods in

18

which they had no control over the enterprise whatsoever.

19

The new board can and should set go forward compensation

however it sees fit, but we don't think it's right for them

to address 2021 compensation.

Page 44

because I think Your Honor touched on many of the points

2

that I was going to raise.

3

effectively right where these programs were last year.

4

think Your Honor was exactly right, and I don't want to put

5

words in your mouth, but the way that we view, the most

6

informative comparison is to take the Purdue total target

7

compensation excluding the retention and compare that to the

8

market because we know that that is an apples-to-apples

9

comparison so we think that's the better way to look at it.

10

The market positioning is
I

And with respect to the commentary on the exit

11

surveys and this idea that employee attrition just doesn't

12

have to do with employee compensation and it's driven by

13

other things, Your Honor, we just don't find that

14

persuasive.

15

leaving that they are leaving for opportunities that pay

16

more money.

17

attrition happening directly after the claw back expired on

18

the last programs.

19

under those circumstances to say, maybe people are leaving

20

for reasons to do other than compensation.

21

stands to reason that compensation is a significant portion

22

of anybody's decision on whether they stay with a job or

leave that job.

courts do apply that standard, including in this district,

Page 47
1

object by parties and interest and ultimately a decision by

2

the Court as to whether the action is properly taken, I

3

think that the appropriate standard is whether, ultimately,

4

in the Court's judgment informed by the parties and

5

interest, both by their objections and if there's no

6

objection, by the lack of an objection, as to whether the

7

action makes good business sense.

8

in Re Orion Pictures, Corp., 4 F.3d 1094.

9

Stated, for example, in

With regard to 503(c)(3) determinations, the

10

courts have long considered specific factors that inform

11

whether the decision makes good business sense and they are

12

traceable back to Judge Lifland's decision in the Dana case,

13

although, one is not limited to those factors in deciding

14

whether the debtor has exercised sound business judgment in

15

making the proposal.

16

Those factors are, is there a reasonable

17

relationship between the plan proposed and the results to be

18

obtained, i.e., will the key employees stay for as long as

19

it takes for the debtor to reorganize or market its assets

20

or in the case of a performance incentive, is the plan

21

calculated to achieve the desired performance; is the cost

22

of the plan reasonable in the context of the debtor's

23

assets, liabilities and earning potential; is the scope of

24

the plan fair and reasonable -- does it apply to all

25

employees, does it discriminate unfairly; is the plan of

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 48
1

proposal consistent with industry standards -- what was the

2

due diligence conducted by the debtor in investigating the

3

need for a plan; analyzing which key employees need to be

4

incentivized or induced to stay and what is generally

5

applicable in the particular industry in regard to similar

6

plans; and lastly, did the debtor receive independent

7

counsel in performing due diligence and in creating and

8

authorizing the incentive compensation.

9

In addition, as I just noted, the Court's also

10

informed by the views of other parties and interest, both

11

their objections and, where they are active in the case on

12

other matters, the fact that they have not objected to the

13

proposal at hand.

14

The gateway to applying this standard as opposing

15

to -- opposed to a standard that required to focus on

16

incentivization and targets for performance is whether or

17

not, as I said, the participants in the KERP program are not

18

7

I agree with District Judge Oetken in Herrington

8

v. LSC Communications, Inc, in Re LSC Communications, Inc.

9

which was recently decided earlier this month, 2021 U.S.

10

Distr. LEXIS 128403, (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2021), that in some

11

respects the law as to who is an insider for these purposes

12

is somewhat murky.

13

agree if someone is in fact appointed by the board as an

14

officer, there is a strong presumption that requires

15

substantial evidence to rebut that they would not count as

16

an insider for purposes of this section, but, again, that's

17

the first category of someone who is excluded from this

group, i.e., that they weren't an officer appointed by the

19

board.

20

However, consistent with that opinion, I

It does not appear to me, independent of the fact

that there are objections on this point, that any of the

debtor's analysis here as to who is within the program and

2

So I do apply the Dana business judgment framework

3

here to this motion and the relief that is being sought

4

today from that motion, and I will note in that regard that

consistent with this KERP program not applying to insiders,

it is frankly a rather simple program that is consistent

with the debtor's compensation practices for decades for

8

these types of employees.

It is clear from Ms. Gartrell's

10

salary, their base salary is under market compared to the

11

total compensation paid by the debtor's competitors in the

12

industry and substantially so.

13

It is clear to me from the record of this hearing,

14

which through Ms. Gartrell's declaration incorporates the

15

record of the more extensive hearing that I held with regard

16

to the 2020 compensation program, that the KERP program is

17

necessary to bring the debtor's non-insider employees who

18

are within the program up to a competitive compensation

19

level with the competitors in the debtor's industry.

21

live testimony today.

This

22

I do not view this program, therefore, as one

23

would, as a lay person, typically view a bonus program.

24

Generally, one views a bonus program as an enhancement to a

25

normal compensation program to reward an employee for

meeting difficult targets or sharing in unanticipated

2

success of the organization for which the employee works.

3

This is, again, as far as the KERP goes, much more of a

4

normal compensation component, and without it, these

5

employees would not be compensated at market.

6

I think that is an important point for people to

7

understand given the somewhat loose usage of the term

8

"bonus" and I take seriously evaluating whether, in fact, an

9

asserted program falls into one or the other categories.

Of

that makes the company's non-insider employees compensated

14

on a basis consistent with industry standards.

15

appears to be, not to be discriminatory as among the non-

16

insider employees and both of those conclusions, which I've

reached based on the evidence before me, are also supported

by independent analysis by the company's, Watkins Tower

11

Although I can understand why there was some

12

confusion in the objection over it, namely the role played

13

by the third component of the KERP program, the targeted

14

retention payments, which are consistent with last year's

15

targeted retention payments, and whether those payments take

oath that the company was comfortable paying, in that case,

14

the severance, after due investigation.

15

Is that what you are mentioning here?

16

THE COURT:

I don't contemplate something under

17

oath.

I contemplate that the Board will make sure that this

18

due diligence is done.

19

would have to do due diligence to confirm that.

really talking about a certification.

If it's already been done, they
I'm not

I'm just --

21

MR. PREIS:

I got it.

22

THE COURT:

I just want to make sure that it's

23

been done, that it's been looked into.

24
25

MR. VONNEGUT:

Yeah.

Your Honor, I think the

concern that we have is certain of the things that have been

Page 65

requested by the Non-Consenting States amount to a request

2

effectively that we prove a negative with respect to every

3

employee of the company, or that we --

4

THE COURT:

Well, no, look -- I would expect the

5

Board would need to do this, would need to assure itself

6

that they're not retaining -- the company's not retaining

7

people that would fall into one of those two categories in

8

Paragraph 9.

9

parties, including Mr. Troop's clients, can talk to the

And I think that the Committee and other key

10

Debtors, you know, and get confirmation that they have had

11

that process.

12

I'm not really looking at this as a judicial

13

process that would lead to a hearing.

14

corporate management that you do this.

15

MR. VONNEGUT:

It's just good

I understand, Your Honor.

I think

16

a lot of the confusion and concern, frankly, comes from the

17

deposition transcript that the Non-Consenting States cite,

18

in which Dr. Landau says he did not order an investigation.

19

Frankly --

20

THE COURT:

Well, okay, very well.

But I just

21

think, to me, given the plea agreement and the

22

representations that the Debtors have made, for example,

23

that they sold -- they got rid of their sales force, et

24

cetera, that this should be a relatively easy but important

25

step for the Debtors to take.

Page 66
1

And it may be, as you say, Mr. Vonnegut, that they

2

have already taken it.

3

that I have in mind, which is that they literally -- the

4

Board asks key people the question, how do you believe that

5

these people are not in these two categories, either of

6

these two categories.

7

it's not an investigation, just how do you know?

8

they have questions, then they'll ask them, and people will

9

have to follow-up on it.

10

I'm not sure they have in the sense

And they will hear the answers.

And

And if

For most of these people, I'm assuming it will be

11

a really easy answer.

They worked in a different

12

department, you know?

They worked for Rhodes Industries,

13

and they did something completely different.

14

probably -- you know, at some point you'll narrow it down to

15

a very small group, if none.

16

They will

But I just want to have some assurance that those

17

questions have been asked in a directed, focused way, as

18

opposed to just responding to investigations by the DOJ and

19

other law enforcement bodies.

20

MR. VONNEGUT:

21

THE COURT:

But it's not to --

Understood, Your Honor.

It's not to come up with a report

22

under oath or anything like that, although it's certainly

23

within the Committee's mandate and other parties' mandate to

24

inquire of you about, okay, did you do it?

25

nothing...

And there's

Page 67

Look, the Debtors have said they're perfectly

2

willing to sit down with people who are active in the case

3

and talk with them.

4

having those questions answered, wouldn't be willing to sit

5

down and talk with the Committee or Mr. Troop's client to

6

just say, yeah, we did this, and this is what we did.

I don't know why Mr. Miller, after

MR. VONNEGUT:

THE COURT:

9

Understood, Your Honor.

Okay.

And I appreciate this may take

a little while to draft, but I don't view it as like turning

10

into a four-page paragraph.

11

representation that the Debtors will undertake a due

12

diligence review, based on what they know already, and

13

whether they need to supplement that in any way to

14

reasonably assure themselves that no one falls into one of

15

these two categories.

16

MR. VONNEGUT:

17

THE COURT:

18

I view it much more as a

Okay.

Mr. Preis, you look very

Does that raise an issue for you?

MR. PREIS:

No, no.

21

THE COURT:

Okay.

22

MR. PREIS:

That's much clearer.

23

THE COURT:

Okay.

20

I appreciate you explaining

that.

All right.

All right, so I

would normally say just email me the order and copy the

parties who you normally copy, including Mr. Higgins and Mr.

circulate the order with a little more talk as to, you know,

the actual language in Paragraph 9.

4

But I think you're going to have to

a complicated multi-sentence specification of an

investigation.

7

type of due diligence that a board would conduct or direct

8

to be conducted in this situation.

Okay.

That's not what I have in mind.

Anything else?

It's the

Did you have any other

10

questions, Mr. Vonnegut, or does anyone else have a

question?

MR. VONNEGUT:

THE COURT:

14

look for that order.

15

want to be clear, I'm granting the motion on one condition,

which is that I don't determine to liquidate the company.

it seems.
