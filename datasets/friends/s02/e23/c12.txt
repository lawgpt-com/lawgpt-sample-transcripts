Richard Burke: Monica, wake up. Monica.
Monica Geller: What's up?
Richard Burke: I thought of a thing.
Monica Geller: Yeah?
Richard Burke: Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Monica Geller: No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Richard Burke: Or so I would have you believe.
Monica Geller: No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Richard Burke: Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Monica Geller: Alright, go on.
Richard Burke: Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Monica Geller: Oh my God, you're a freak.
Richard Burke: Yeah. How 'bout that.
