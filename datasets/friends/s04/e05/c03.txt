Chandler Bing: Hi!
Kathy: Hi.
Chandler Bing: Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Kathy: I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Kathy: You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Chandler Bing: Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Kathy: Oh please!
Chandler Bing: So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Kathy: Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Chandler Bing: That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Kathy: Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Chandler Bing: Is it on?
Kathy: No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Kathy: Oh my God!
Chandler Bing: Oh! It's on! It's on!
