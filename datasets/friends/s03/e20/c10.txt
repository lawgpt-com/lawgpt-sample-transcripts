Rachel Green: Call her! Call her now!
Chandler Bing: Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Rachel Green: Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Chandler Bing: Oh, well give me the phone then.
Rachel Green: Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Chandler Bing: Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Rachel Green: Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Chandler Bing: Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel Green: I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Chandler Bing: All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Rachel Green: That's fine!
Chandler Bing: That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Rachel Green: I know.
