Chandler Bing: Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Chandler Bing: Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Janice Litman Goralnik: On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Chandler Bing: Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Ticket Counter Attendant: One ticket to Yemen?
Chandler Bing: Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Ticket Counter Attendant: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
Chandler Bing: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Ticket Counter Attendant: Are you travelling with a child?
Chandler Bing: No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Ticket Counter Attendant: Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Janice Litman Goralnik: What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Chandler Bing: American Express?
