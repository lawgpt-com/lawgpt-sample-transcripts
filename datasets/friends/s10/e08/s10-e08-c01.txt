Monica Geller: Hey guys!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: We need to talk to you about something.
Chandler Bing: Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
#ALL#: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Ross Geller: Are you kidding?
Chandler Bing: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Ross Geller: That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Chandler Bing: No, no! We made this decision together.
Ross Geller: She's putting words in your mouth!
Joey Tribbiani: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Rachel Green: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Monica Geller: No, it's not!
Rachel Green: It's not? When was she born?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Monica Geller: Thank you, Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Monica Geller: What? You are way off, lady!
Phoebe Buffay: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Monica Geller: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Chandler Bing: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Monica Geller: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Chandler Bing: We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
