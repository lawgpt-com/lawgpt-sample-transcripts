Monica Geller: Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Rachel Green: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Monica Geller: For what?
Rachel Green: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Phoebe Buffay: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Monica Geller: You al-you already had it?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Rachel Green: Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
Phoebe Buffay: We ruined everything.
Rachel Green: Ugh...
Monica Geller: Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Rachel Green: What do you, what do you mean?
Monica Geller: Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
