Rachel Green: How can you not remember us kissing?!
Melissa Warburton: I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Rachel Green: Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Rachel Green: Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Melissa Warburton: I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Rachel Green: No!!
Phoebe Buffay: Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Rachel Green: Thank you Phoebe.
Melissa Warburton: She didn't.
Phoebe Buffay: I know.
