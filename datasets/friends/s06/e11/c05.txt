Rachel Green: Hey! We're here!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Ohh! Oh my God!
Ross Geller: You like it?
Rachel Green: Oh no!
Ross Geller: It's my new apothecary table!
Rachel Green: Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Ross Geller: Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Rachel Green: I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Ross Geller: Why did you do that?
Rachel Green: Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Ross Geller: She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Rachel Green: I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Ross Geller: What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Rachel Green: Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Ross Geller: Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Rachel Green: Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Ross Geller: Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Rachel Green: Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Ross Geller: Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Ross Geller: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Phoebe Buffay: Sure!
Rachel Green: He got it a flea market!
Phoebe Buffay: You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
