Chandler Bing: Hey.
Monica Geller: So how was Joan?
Chandler Bing: I broke up with her.
Chandler Bing: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Rachel Green: Come on, they were not that huge.
Chandler Bing: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Monica Geller: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Joey Tribbiani: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
Chandler Bing: You or me?
Ross Geller: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Joey Tribbiani: You guys are messin' with me, right?
#ALL#: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Phoebe Buffay: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Chandler Bing: Maureen Rosilla.
Ross Geller: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Monica Geller: Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Mr. Heckles: You're doing it again.
Monica Geller: We're not doing anything.
Mr. Heckles: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Rachel Green: You don't have birds.
Mr. Heckles: I could have birds.
Monica Geller: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Mr. Heckles: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Rachel Green: All right, bye-bye.
Chandler Bing: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Ross Geller: We'll give you Janice.
Phoebe Buffay: I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Rachel Green: "Oh, my, god."
Joey Tribbiani: "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Monica Geller: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Rachel Green: We won. We won!
