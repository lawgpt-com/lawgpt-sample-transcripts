Chandler Bing: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Chandler Bing: Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Chandler Bing: He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Phoebe Buffay: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Gary: Hey Chandler.
Chandler Bing: Hey Gar!
Gary: Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Okay.
Gary: You look very pretty today.
Phoebe Buffay: Thanks! Okay.
Gary: Here's the thing.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Gary: Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-hmm.
Gary: Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Phoebe Buffay: No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Gary: Phoebe?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Gary: I want you to move in with me.
Phoebe Buffay: That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Gary: Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Phoebe Buffay: I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Gary: Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay: I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Gary: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Which is why my answer is yes!
Gary: Really?!
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
