Rachel Green: Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my!
Rachel Green: They're male nurses.
Joey Tribbiani: Not in my head.
Rachel Green: Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Monica Geller: Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Rachel Green: What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Monica Geller: Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Rachel Green: What?
Monica Geller: Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Rachel Green: Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Joey Tribbiani: Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Rachel Green: Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
