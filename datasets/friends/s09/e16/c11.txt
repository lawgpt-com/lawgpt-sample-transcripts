Chandler Bing: Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Monica Geller: Honey?
Chandler Bing: Yeah?
Monica Geller: About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Chandler Bing: But honey you don't have to.
Monica Geller: I'm going to get bigger!
Chandler Bing: Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Rachel Green: Argh. fascist.
Monica Geller: Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Chandler Bing: your ass?!?!?
Rachel Green: Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Chandler Bing: They...do that?
Monica Geller: It's kind of a package deal!
Chandler Bing: God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Monica Geller: I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Chandler Bing: Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Rachel Green: Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Chandler Bing: What?
