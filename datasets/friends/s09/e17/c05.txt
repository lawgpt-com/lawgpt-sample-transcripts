Monica Geller: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
Chandler Bing: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Monica Geller: But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Chandler Bing: Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Monica Geller: Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Chandler Bing: Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Monica Geller: What are you doing?
Chandler Bing: Oh, you'll see my friend.
Ross Geller: I'm dead?
Chandler Bing: And so young.
Ross Geller: Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Chandler Bing: Well, how you died was funny.
Ross Geller: Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Chandler Bing: It kills over one americans every year.
Ross Geller: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Chandler Bing: You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ross Geller: You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
