9

points, and I will turn to the questions that the Court issued

10

As your Honor directed, I will not

I just want to highlight three short

last week.

11

First.

Bankruptcy has a specific purpose.

It's

12

designed to give the honest but unfortunate debtor a fresh

13

start, and to provide for an equitable distribution of the

14

debtor's assets to its creditors.

15

neither.

16

Second.

The non-debtor releases do

The plan takes people's constitutionally

17

protected property rights, their rights to sue the non-debtors,

18

and it terminates those rights without their consent.

19

Supreme Court has held, in the class action context, that

20

settling someone's claims for money damages without giving them

21

a chance to say, "No, thank you; I'd rather take my own chances

22

and litigate my own claims," violates due process.

23

the same concerns apply here.

24

And, third.

25

bankruptcy code.

The

We think

The releases are not authorized by the

In fact, the plan grants the non-debtors

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

11
LBUPPUR1
1

really greater than they could get if they were individual

2

debtors, and that just doesn't make any sense.

3

Given the serious constitutional concerns raised by

4

the review system, the code should not be read to implicitly

5

authorize when they are not expressly authorized.

6

Now, turning to the questions that the Court has

7

issued.

For the first question, we think the standard of

8

review that applies to -- reviewing of the releases is the same

9

as to all the Sacklers and all the non-debtors.

We posit that

10

under Stern and Executive Benefits, this Court should review

11

all of the factual findings and legal conclusions as to

12

non-debtor releases de novo.

13

To the extent the Court was asking whether there is a

14

distinction as to the validity of the releases among the

15

Sacklers, depending on their involvement in Purdue management,

16

we still think the answer is no.

17

infirmities and the lack of statutory authorization for the

18

releases are the same.

19

Moving to question 2.

The constitutional

Again, we believe that there is

20

a problem under Stern and under Executive Benefits and

21

Bankruptcy Rule 8018.1.

22

court's order like a magistrate's report and recommendation and

23

review it de novo.

24

issue its own findings.

25

This Court may treat the bankruptcy

So this Court may review the record and

If the Court disagrees and believes that the
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

12
LBUPPUR1
1

bankruptcy court was acting within its constitutional

2

authority, it may remand the matter back to Judge Drain for

3

further factual findings, but we don't think there are any

4

findings that could make the releases permissible here.

5

THE COURT:

I mean, I have to say I don't have much

6

fault with Judge Drain's factual findings, and nobody seems to

7

be attacking the factual findings.

8

the conclusions that are drawn from the factual findings.

9

MS. SAKATA:

10

THE COURT:

11

know, I'm an appeals court.

12

what, right?

13

MS. SAKATA:

14

THE COURT:

People seem to be attacking

And the standards that he applies.
Right.

That's all law.

Okay?

And, you

I review the law de novo no matter

Yes, your Honor.
So fascinating, though, the third question

15

is, it's kind of a frolicking detour.

16

has a problem with the basic factual findings, and they are

17

extensive, then we are where we are.

18

MS. SAKATA:

If nobody in the room

To the extent that the finding is an

19

ultimate finding, one that blends factual finding and law

20

together, we do have some challenges, which we have.

21
22

THE COURT:

But those are the kinds of

the things I would review de novo anyway.

23

MS. SAKATA:

24

THE COURT:

25

Right, okay.

Yes, your Honor.
Basic facts.

That all the Sacklers got

off the board by 2018, nobody is disputing that.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

I mean, it's

5

other non-debtors.

6

against the Sacklers and other non-debtors that were enjoined.

extent that they were not -- the debtors did not try to show

4

that every potential claim that the plan terminated against

didn't meet that burden.

I can go through them individually, if you want, or I can just
move on to the questions.

Your Honor has subject matter

THE COURT:

MS. SAKATA:

19

unpack in this question.

21

And so to the

Right.
Yes, I agree with that, your Honor.

Moving on to question 5.

THE COURT:

So there's a lot to

And also, I mean, I understand what you're

22

saying, that it's the debtor's burden to show that in every

23

case there was subject matter jurisdiction.

24

there was subject matter jurisdiction of Judge Drain, then

25

there's something that's validly before me that I can opine on,

But if in any case

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

16
LBUPPUR1
1
2

right?
MS. SAKATA:

So the appeal that is currently before

3

this Court, absolutely this Court has subject matter

4

jurisdiction over.

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

I just don't want there to be

6

any -- I don't want to do all of this only to discover that

7

somebody is going to go up to the Second Circuit and say I

8

didn't have subject matter to decide it.

9

MS. SAKATA:

No, your Honor.

Whether or not the

10

bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction to terminate

11

all of the claims that it purported to terminate under the

12

plan, I think is a separate question.

13

only has subject jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case, and

14

this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal.

15

THE COURT:

16

MS. SAKATA:

The bankruptcy court

Okay.
So as to question 5, there are a number

17

of different factors that are sort of included in the question,

18

and there are just five points that we'd like to address here.

19
20
21
22

First, we disagree with the premise that there is
authority for non-consensual non-debtor releases.
THE COURT:

I know you do.

That's why you're taking

an appeal.

23

MS. SAKATA:

24

THE COURT:

25

MS. SAKATA:

I beg your pardon?
That's why you took the appeal.
Yes, your Honor, exactly right.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

17
LBUPPUR1
1

Second.

We also disagree with the idea that just

2

because a claim may have a conceivable affect on the bankruptcy

3

estate that the bankruptcy court also has authority to release

4

it.

5

a claim, but it would lack constitutional or statutory

6

authority to just terminate it without adjudicating it because,

7

in the court's opinion, everyone would be better off if it does

8

so.

9

A court may have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate

Third.

And we discussed this point on page 24 of our

10

reply brief.

11

authority at the outset of the bankruptcy case, to the full

12

extent of its authority related to subject matter jurisdiction

13

to pause any claim that might confuse the impact of the estate

14

while the case is being administered.

15

It may make sense for a court to exercise

But it's a completely different thing to terminate

16

those claims at the end of the case, when a plan is going to be

17

confirmed, given that any continued claims against the estate

18

can be treated in the plan itself.

19

could be disallowed, it could be -- many different things could

20

happen to them.

21

Fourth.

It can be paid for, it

The Court raised in its question the idea of

22

a consensual release, and theoretically, parties can agree to

23

give up their claims.

24

any such consensual release has to be narrowly and affirmative.

25

And, of course, there's been no attempt to seek or get

It's the U.S. Trustee's position that

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

18
LBUPPUR1
1

affirmative consent from any of the releasing parties here.

2

And fifth, which is I think the Court being pointed to

3

the question, if there were authority to release non-debtor

4

claims on a non-consensual basis, it would not extend to claims

5

that would otherwise be non-dischargeable.

6

for a bankruptcy court to be able to use its power to grant a

7

non-debtor greater relief than it could grant an individual

8

debtor, when Congress has expressly stated that a particular

9

liability cannot be discharged.

10

It makes no sense

For question six, again, there are a number of points

11

here, three, to discuss here.

12

point about the distinction between subject matter jurisdiction

13

and authority to permanently extinguish claims.

14

Second.

First, again, we heard your

Even if there were the possibility of an

15

indemnification claim, as we explained in ECF page 25 of our

16

reply brief, that by itself should not justify a third-party

17

release.

18

Foundation that if you were to -- if you were to grant a

19

third-party release anytime there was such claim for

20

indemnification, that third-party releases would be the norm

21

and not the exception.

22

The Fourth Circuit said in National Heritage

THE COURT:

It would no longer be a rare case.

Yes.

Okay.

I think that's a very

23

interesting opinion, but I sit in the Second Circuit, where

24

they take a very broad view of conceivable effects.

25

And so as I understand what Judge Pooler said in SPV
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

19
LBUPPUR1
1

Osus, if there's a reasonable legal basis for a party to assert

2

a contingent claim, then the bankruptcy court has subject

3

matter jurisdiction, even though the test, the old wording of

4

it, the old Celotex wording of the text, is that you look to

5

the outcome of the case, not the fact that the case could be

6

brought.

7

And there's a tension between those two things that

8

I've gotten hung up on.

9

will all, collectively, from your different vantage points,

10
11

So that's what I'm hoping that you

help me through because I really do see a tension there.
I also see a tension between saying that, on the one

12

hand, the bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction over

13

the contingent claim, but somehow the contingency would rise to

14

subject matter jurisdiction over an underlying claim if, in

15

fact, there is no subject matter jurisdiction over that

16

underlying claim.

17

MS. SAKATA:

18

THE COURT:

Your Honor -Because I think what Judge Pooler was

19

talking about in SPV Osus, and she was suggesting that subject

20

matter jurisdiction, because of the contingency, you have

21

subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying claim.

22

lawsuit B, which is your ultimate lawsuit for contribution out

23

there, is what gives you subject matter jurisdiction over

24

lawsuit A, which isn't the lawsuit for contribution.

25

kind of hung up on that, too, okay?
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

So

And I got

20
LBUPPUR1
1

So I'm hung up on two things with respect to subject

2

matter jurisdiction, and maybe I said it more clearly here than

3

I did in asking the question, which I did come up with four

4

days ago, before I thought about this some more.

5

MS. SAKATA:

But, your Honor, we appreciated the

6

advance claim that you provided us on Friday.

I agree there's

7

tension in the SPV case.

8

matter jurisdiction, given how broad related to jurisdiction

9

could be, is still a separate issue from whether or not the

I would posit again, the subject

10

Court has authority to terminate them on a non-consensual

11

basis.

12

Metromedia did list the possibility of indemnification

13

and contribution as a factor when it was talking about factors

14

that have been applied by cases when they issued non-debtor

15

releases.

16

from A.H. Robins in the Fourth Circuit.

17

many other factors it was looking at, including the fact that

18

it was a class action that had been certified, the fact that --

19

and more importantly, I think, to the Fourth Circuit's analysis

20

is that plan paid for everyone's claims and --

But that factor that it listed in Metromedia came

21

THE COURT:

22

MS. SAKATA:

23

THE COURT:

24

MS. SAKATA:

25

And A.H. Robins had

That was a big deal.
That was a big deal.
That was a very, very big deal.
So I think that's why it's important that

it's the Fourth Circuit in National Heritage Foundation, who
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

21
LBUPPUR1
1
2
3
4

later said that indemnification by itself is not enough.
THE COURT:

Which was the Robins circuit.

No, I

appreciate that nicety.
MS. SAKATA:

So third.

As to question 6, again, we

5

agree that the fact that there could be claims against the

6

Sacklers that would result in judgments against the Sacklers

7

that would be paid by the Sackler, is not an outcome that

8

itself impacts the bankruptcy estate.

9

Now, we're not sure if the Court is highlighting the

10

State claims in the case for a particular reason because there

11

are possibilities for individual claims to also not be covered

12

by insurance, or not be subject to indemnification or

13

contribution.

14

THE COURT:

Well, I got this great set of briefs, very

15

informative, very well done.

16

MS. SAKATA:

17

THE COURT:

All right.

Moving on to --

Can we go back to this tension between

18

Celotex and SPV Osus, between outcome and a contingent claim

19

with a reasonable legal basis for its assertion having a

20

conceivable effect on the States.

21

I have two questions.

The first one is, I sit in the

22

Second Circuit.

23

and resolve that tension?

24

Judge Pooler over the edge of the cliff?

25

Don't I have to let the Second Circuit address

MS. SAKATA:

Don't I have to just march behind

I think, of course, the Second Circuit is

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

22
LBUPPUR1
1

the mandatory precedent, but I think also to be --

2

THE COURT:

I've written a lot of opinions criticizing

3

Second Circuit precedent and inviting the Second Circuit to

4

think about things.

5

don't I really have to follow it?

6

MS. SAKATA:

7

THE COURT:

8

MS. SAKATA:

9
10

I'm kind of notorious for doing that, but

You do have to follow it, your Honor.
Okay.
Again, it's just because there might be

broad subject matter jurisdiction isn't the same thing that you
can terminate it.

11

I will continue to --

THE COURT:

No, just because -- to move on, just

12

because there's subject matter jurisdiction and statutory

13

authority and maybe even some of the Metromedia factors, it

14

doesn't mean that the bankruptcy court or District Court has to

15

approve the releases.

16

this.

17
18

MS. SAKATA:

I mean, there nothing mandatory about

Well, your Honor, we disagree that

there's statutory authorization.

19

THE COURT:

I know you do.

Let's assume if everybody

20

has the power to do everything, can we agree it's not mandatory

21

that these releases be approved?

22

right.

23

is.

It's not mandatory.

I understand the question.

All

I don't remember what it

Keep going.

24

MS. SAKATA:

25

THE COURT:

Okay.

Moving on to question 7.

Oh, I know what the question is.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

So -The

23
LBUPPUR1
1

question is, and this may be better addressed to the States.

2

As a theoretical legal matter, does the ability to recoup, say,

3

an advancement of insurance costs, does the ability to recoup

4

on a contingent claim if, in fact, after a trial, the Sacklers

5

were found to have done the horrible things that you accuse

6

them of doing?

7

Not you, but that others accuse them of doing.

Does the fact of ability to recoup mean that,

8

ultimately, there really isn't any effect on -- have any

9

conceivable effect on the estate?

10

Say you had a right to defense costs being advanced,

11

but the defense costs could be recouped if they lost the

12

lawsuit.

13

of recoupment going on, but the policies do provide for that.

14

If the estate could recoup the money that the insurance

15

policies advanced to the Sacklers to defend the lawsuits, does

16

that mean there's no conceivable effect, ultimately, on the

17

estate?

Happens all the time under D and O policy.

18

MS. SAKATA:

19

THE COURT:

20

MS. SAKATA:

21
22
23
24
25

Not a lot

On the broad region -They lose some interest, I guess.
-- of the subject matter jurisdiction, I

think there is an impact, but I'm sure other Appellants can -THE COURT:
address that.

Okay.

MS. SAKATA:

Yes, the States are probably better to
Now I'll shut up and you talk.
No, your Honor.

So question 7 is -- so

the question is more in the debtor's brief and how it's
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

24
LBUPPUR1
1

explaining how the plan works; so I will leave it to the

2

debtors.

3

THE COURT:

A number of these questions, I didn't say

4

Purdue, please, answer this question, but I think they've

5

figured out a number of these questions.

6

appellee in an appeal, you get a lot of questions.

7

MS. SAKATA:

When you're the

We have points that we wanted to address,

8

your Honor.

The way the release is written, it's not limited

9

to the release of the claims that belong to the estate.

If it

10

were, then the non-debtor releases in section 10.7 of the plan

11

would not be necessary.

12

THE COURT:

13

MS. SAKATA:

14

THE COURT:

15
16

I know that.
So --

Globally, I know this.

its claims against the Sacklers.
MS. SAKATA:

That's not how it's written.

Purdue can relieve

Perfectly free to do so.

Even if they were to agree that the

17

release doesn't actually impact debtors' claims, it's not with

18

the authority of statements of intent about the release.

19

the language of the release itself that matters, and we think

20

it does extend beyond that.

21

Moving to question 8.

It's

So we agree with your Honor.

22

We don't think the language of the release is limited to the

23

effects that the Sacklers claim.

24

Sacklers claim that they only want to have protection from

25

having to litigate their fraudulent claims that they have

Again, to the extent that the

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

25
LBUPPUR1
1

settled with Purdue, that is accomplished by section 10.6.

2

section 10.7 is not necessary.

3
4

So

Moving to question 9, which is the hypothetical, this
is, unfortunately, not as simple as it might seem.

5

THE COURT:

Ahh, we have spent a lot of time with

6

Suzie Sackler, okay, in chambers because, as you know from

7

every communique you've gotten, we've been trying to dream up

8

claims that could be ascertained against these other Sacklers,

9

the non-officer, director, manager Sacklers.

10

And this is our

favorite example; so....

11

MS. SAKATA:

Okay.

So, well, with regard to these

12

hypotheticals, it depends on the timing and other factors.

13

if the claim happened after the effective date, then the

14

release would not terminate it because it would fall within the

15

definition of the concluded claim.

16

THE COURT:

17

MS. SAKATA:

So

I should have said before the effective.
All right.

So if it happened before,

18

then it depends on whether or not Purdue's conduct is otherwise

19

legally relevant, and because the plan defined code of action

20

very broadly, which means there's defenses, it could come up in

21

different circumstances.

22

conduct be otherwise legally relevant if the roommate thought

23

OxyContin was safe because she heard the false marketing from

24

Purdue.

25

THE COURT:

So, for example, could Purdue's

Okay.

Let me make this as simple as

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

26
LBUPPUR1
1

possible.

2

Purdue about OxyContin or anything else.

3

her a bottle of pills, says, these will take care of your

4

backache.

5

Purdue manufactured the pills.

6

All right?

She never heard any marketing from

Purdue's conduct is factually relevant because
Okay?

But is there a claim that's released under the

7

release?

8

language on his own.

9

that that claim could be released?

10

Her roommate gives

Is Purdue's conduct -- Judge Drain came up with this

MS. SAKATA:

Is Purdue's conduct legally relevant such

So could be that the -- if you have a

11

claim -- if the roommate would bring a claim against Suzie that

12

she is conspiring with Purdue to get people addicted to

13

OxyContin, then Purdue's conduct as the part of a conspirator

14

would be legally relevant.

15

Also, your Honor, in terms

16

THE COURT:

17

You've added facts about my hypothetical.

We're dealing with two college students.

18

MS. SAKATA:

19

THE COURT:

20

MS. SAKATA:

Up to -One has a bottle of pain pills.
But you could have variety of different

21

factual scenarios in which these could arise, and so you can't

22

anticipate all the different ways in which someone could allege

23

whether it's part of a claim or it's part of a defense,

24

Purdue's conduct.

25

relevant means, but it could be in such a case --

It's, frankly, very confusing what legally

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

27
LBUPPUR1
1

THE COURT:

2

MS. SAKATA:

3

Also, with regard to, you know,

hypothetical --

4
5

What does it mean to you?

THE COURT:

That's a serious question.

What does

legally relevant mean?

6

MS. SAKATA:

It would seem to include claims against

7

the Sackler family in which Purdue's conduct can be part of a

8

legal claim or a legal defense.

9

THE COURT:

I don't know what that means.

In my very

10

simple Suzie Sackler hypothetical, Purdue's conduct is

11

factually relevant because Purdue makes the pills, but that

12

doesn't make it legally relevant.

13

So what does legally relevant -- "legally relevant" is

14

not a term that I am familiar with, after 45 years in this

15

profession.

16

What's legally relevant?

MS. SAKATA:

Your Honor, we don't understand the

17

meaning of it either, fully, which is, again, part of the

18

problem.

19

So with regard to also your Honor's question about

20

like a hypothetical about the less-involved Sackler family

21

members and what claims there could be brought against them,

22

there's also the possibility of unjust enrichment.

23

be a claim that somebody, for example, who spent his life

24

savings paying for these addictive medications could claim that

25

it's unjust for the Sackler family to retain the proceeds of
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

Which would

28
LBUPPUR1
1

all the things that he had paid.

2

And, you know, whether or not Purdue's conduct would

3

be legally relevant in that case, is something that could be

4

raised, could be argued.

5

THE COURT:

I don't know.

Well, and Purdue takes the position that

6

the other Sacklers, the non-officer, director, manager Sacklers

7

are liable -- are being relieved only from claims against them

8

as transferees.

9

a fraudulent conveyance claim, is asserted against them as

10

I assume an unjust enrichment claim, just like

transferees of the funds.

11

MS. SAKATA:

I mean, Purdue earned the money.

But they retained the profits, your

12

Honor.

13

subject to unjust enrichment.

14

THE COURT:

15
16

You can have an innocent beneficiary who is still

I understand that.

I understand.

And

that would be as a transferee; so that claim would be released.
MS. SAKATA:

Well, if they are being -- if they are

17

releasing claims, the estate claims, which would be estate

18

claims for fraudulent transfer --

19

THE COURT:

20

MS. SAKATA:

21

THE COURT:

Forget about fraudulent transfer.
Okay.
If there's one thing I agree -- there are

22

many things I agree with Judge Drain about.

23

is that it would be very hard to prove a fraudulent transfer

24

claim in this and harder to collect on it.

25

One thing I agree

I don't think that's a particularly relevant issue on
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

29
LBUPPUR1
1

this appeal, whether Purdue could prove a fraudulent transfer

2

claim.

3

than a fraudulent transfer claim.

4

nub is that I've been missing the forest for the trees.

5

real claim against the other Sacklers is that they were

6

unjustly enriched by the profits that were earned by Purdue

7

selling this awful stuff causing people to be addicted.

8
9
10

But an unjust enrichment claim is a different claim

MS. SAKATA:

And

your Honor was right to think of all different hypotheticals
there.

It can come up in different ways.
THE COURT:

12

MS. SAKATA:

13

we completely agree with it.

14

THE COURT:

15

MS. SAKATA:

16

THE COURT:

Your Honor, that's just one example.

What does that mean?
We believe that the claim is going -Oh, the channeling the question.
Exactly.

It's not channeling it.

My numbering is off.

That's really a

question for them.
MS. SAKATA:

Okay.

For question 11 about the director

21

and officer liability insurance; so just Jessie Delconte, who

22

was the debtor's only witness on the insurance issue, he

23

submitted a trial declaration that disclosed D and O policies

24

only for the period from 2003 to 2004 and 2016 to 2018.

25

other evidence was produced.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

No

30
LBUPPUR1
1

We assume if it existed, the debtors would have

2

produced it, and we agree that it would have been clear error

3

for the bankruptcy court to hold that insurance to be impacted

4

when insurance didn't exist.

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

The Newco question is really a

6

question for Purdue.

7

would actually like you to address the question about if I

8

conclude that Judge Drain went off the rails at some point, are

9

there issues I can avoid deciding?

10

MS. SAKATA:

Your time is coming to a close; so I

Your Honor, we think that there's no

11

obligation to reach Stern or any specific issue if this Court

12

reverses because it determines the non-debtor releases are

13

impermissible.

14

if you can construe the bankruptcy code to avoid the

15

constitutional issues.

16

There's no need to reach constitutional issues

THE COURT:

That's what I was taught in law school, is

17

that I'm supposed to avoid constitutional issues if I can do

18

so.

19

MS. SAKATA:

Yes.

avoided every issue.

MS. SAKATA:

One thing, your Honor.

If your Honor

2

were inclined to send us back to Judge Drain for further, more

3

robust factual filings, then we would ask the Court to address

4

the challenges made to that, and there would be more direction

5

and we wouldn't have to be back here before your Honor.

Okay.

All right.

Do

you want to just kind of bring it to a close?

That's it?

Who's up next?

bankruptcy code and the Second Circuit precedent and answering

4

your Honor's questions related to those topics.

5

My counterpart from Connecticut will be addressing

6

jurisdictional issues and the messengers of municipalities.

7

And then California and Maryland will be presenting their own

8

arguments.

9

THE COURT:

10

Okay.

MR. PURCELL:

So, your Honor, I want to start by

11

addressing why it's a violation of code to use non-debtor

12

relief to distinguish these power claims.

13

ever done that, and this Court should not extend the non-debtor

14

release doctrine so far.

15

violates the bankruptcy code, and most clearly, 11 U.S.C. 523.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. PURCELL:

No Federal Court has

The first reason is simple.

It

I'm sorry.

11 U.S.C. 523.

But in

18

particular, 523(a)(7) prohibits individual debtors from using

19

the bankruptcy process to escape government-imposed fines and

20

penalties, which is exactly what the Sacklers were doing in

21

this case, preemptively escaping from the State police power

22

claims that would impose government fines and penalties against

23

them.

24
25

Similarly, 523(a)(2)(A) prohibits individuals from
using the bankruptcy process to escape debts for money that was

Sacklers for misrepresenting the dangers and addictiveness of

And that, too,

But because the release violates clear and specific

6

code provisions, it cannot be approved under Supreme Court

that what they've obtained here, what the Sacklers have

obtained, is a release and not a discharge.

The other side's primary response is

11

release, in effect, can be a bankruptcy discharge --

12

THE COURT:

Well, he said not that it is a bankruptcy

13

discharge, but it has the same effect as a bankruptcy

14

discharge.

15

MR. PURCELL:

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. PURCELL:

Exactly.

So what's the point?
Well, the point, your Honor, the

18

overarching point is this is fundamentally a question of what

19

Congress intended in enacting these statutes, and it's just

20

unfathomable that an individual debtor could not release

21

certain claims in their own bankruptcy but escape those same

22

claims in another party's bankruptcy.

23

There is no reason on earth why Congress would have

24

wanted that system, and so in interpreting those provisions, it

25

makes no sense to read them the way that the other side has.

Now, one question your Honor asks that goes to this

issue is whether the same principle, I think it's your fifth

13

type of abuse that the Second Circuit warned of in Metromedia

14

and that this Court warned of in Karta.

15

THE COURT:

Right.

First, they are exactly the

Okay.

So that there was a

warning, but a warning isn't Second Circuit precedent.

That's what a

Honestly, it is.

MR. PURCELL:

Fair enough, your Honor.

What I would

22

say is Metromedia emphasized that there are only a very limited

23

number of cases in which the Second Circuit has actually

24

approved a non-debtor release.

25

cases, there was some other statutory authority, whether it was

And in every one of those

the federal rules in Drexel, whether it was 360 --

They didn't approve a non-debtor release

They approved a certification of a class.

MR. PURCELL:

THE COURT:

MR. PURCELL:

THE COURT:

9

MR. PURCELL:

That couldn't be certified today.
Well, and so really --

Under current class action law.
So really, the only cases we're talking

about are Quigley, where you had 524(g) --

11
12

That

really --

6

10

Exactly my point, your Honor.

THE COURT:

Asbestos cases don't count.

Asbestos

cases are asbestos cases.

13

MR. PURCELL:

14

THE COURT:

So now the only --

Real easy to flag.

You have to

15

understand, I've taken all the asbestos cases as exemplars of

16

approval release, and I put them over there because they are

17

clearly allowed.

18
19

They are clearly authorized under 524(g).

MR. PURCELL:

THE COURT:

21

MR. PURCELL:

THE COURT:

the only one you're left with then is MacArthur v. Manville.

But Manville is an asbestos case.
But before 524(g) --

Before 524(g) it was still an asbestos

It just didn't have the statute.
MR. PURCELL:

And the Court clearly cited 363 and the

power to control the debtor's property.

And so there's no

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

36
LBUPPUR1
1

Second Circuit case where a release has been approved that is

2

remotely like this one.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

4

MR. PURCELL:

And so the point of the warning, your

5

Honor, is the warning was:

6

same -- along the same lines of what this Court said in Karta,

7

if you just accept the idea that this is necessary to achieve a

8

contribution from the non-debtors, it's going to become the

9

norm, which is exactly the danger that's happening here.

10

Don't let this -- you know, the

And, your Honor, in terms of abusiveness, here you

11

have -- the States are alleging, very credibly, that the

12

Sacklers repeatedly violated state and federal law for years,

13

exacted over $10 billion from Purdue, steered the company into

14

bankruptcy, and then attempted to use the bankruptcy to protect

15

themselves for their own liability in the massive opioid

16

crisis.

17

If that is not an abuse of the bankruptcy process,

18

it's unclear what would be, and it is undermining public

19

confidence in the bankruptcy system all together.

20

the Court could reverse on that ground alone, but moving onto

21

other aspects of the precedent --

22
23
24
25

THE COURT:

So we think

And if I reverse on that ground alone, I

wouldn't have to do any more work.
MR. PURCELL:

Fair enough, your Honor.

And we do

think it cannot be sustained as an abuse of the bankruptcy

(212) 805-0300

37
LBUPPUR1

process.

Even if you just look narrowly at the factors the

2

Second Circuit outlined in Metromedia, which is what the Court

3

in Metromedia said not to do, don't just look at these one by

4

one, but if you do --

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. PURCELL:

7

-- the release still fails, and several of your

8

Law review article.
You can say that, your Honor.

I can't.

Honor's questions highlights why.

9

And so to begin with, as your Honor pointed out, the

10

States' claims are not -- the States' claims against the

11

Sacklers, I'm sorry, are not in any meaningful sense channeled.

12

They are just extinguished.

13

15

seventh Metromedia factors.

16

THE COURT:

17

The plan does not provide the

And so that violates the sixth and

I thought there were only five Metromedia

factors.

18

MR. PURCELL:

Well, the list I have, your Honor, is

19

seven, the way I wrote it down.

20

why the law review article -- I will tell you what I'm

21

referring to, which is that the plan does not provide full

22

payment and --

23

THE COURT:

Right.

24

MR. PURCELL:

25

are channeled or extinguished.

But I guess among the reasons

That's five.

-- and the question of whether claims

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

LBUPPUR1

Moving on to some of the other factors, the release is

wildly overbroad, as some of your Honors' questions also get

3

at.

5

there's absolutely no evidence made any contribution whatsoever

6

to the estate.

7

It releases hundreds of people, who have no plausible

And those two facts both violate key parts of the

8

Metromedia test.

I looked at them as the fourth and fifth

9

factors, but whatever number you want to call them, your Honor.

10

And moreover, moving to other Metromedia factors, this is a

11

blanket --

12

THE COURT:

Well, I think the real problem may be --

13

and this is just a question for, I think, the Sacklers -- is

14

that I'm having a hard time telling who put up the money.

15

mean, for all I know, the Sacklers have arranged it so that

16

everybody is putting in something, but I don't know that.

17

MR. PURCELL:

We agree, your Honor.

I

There's

18

absolutely no finding in the record about who's contributing

19

the money or why the release of those specific individuals --

20

these specific individuals is necessary to the plan.

21

And if you look at the Sixth Circuit decision in the

22

Dow Corning case, they reversed on exactly that basis; that

23

there were just these generalized findings about who was

24

contributing and why that was important and why releasing them

25

was important.

No specific findings about why the non-debtor

LBUPPUR1
1

release as to particular entities was necessary.

2

Your Honor, turning to the final --

3

THE COURT:

Judge Drain, has plainly found that it was

4

necessary because you couldn't have a plan that would have been

5

acceptable to a super majority of all of these different

6

creditor groups, which he eventually was able to get, without

7

having, you know, a pot of money.

8
9

And Purdue had a limited pot of money, and so the
Sacklers put money into the pot and sweetened it enough that a

the super majority of all of these creditor groups said, okay,

we'll take that.

15

in that context.

16

So he did make a finding, and for a specific

I guess I want to respond by pointing

17

out two fundamental flaws of that approach.

going to be worse off.

code.

First of all,

In Jevic, the bankruptcy court had found the exact

reason the court said that, it emphasized that while you might

And part of the

It leads to greater uncertainty about what

And the second point, also emphasized in Jevic, is

11

that you can't credit these dubious assertions, as the Court

12

said, about what would happen if the proper legal rules were

13

applied.

14

non-debtor release were off the table, the outcome would be

15

liquidation.

16

Here, there is no reason to assume that if the

The Sacklers -- I mean, Purdue's own brief makes clear

17

that many of the individual Sacklers would face personal

18

bankruptcy if the non-debtor release were not approved, and

19

they have no interest in that.

20

creditors have no interest in receiving nothing, obviously.

21

And so there would be a strong incentive --

22

THE COURT:

The States and the other

What you're saying is there would be a

23

whole new round of negotiations, that the Sacklers would throw

24

more into the pot and there would eventually be a number

25

that -- ding, ding, ding, ding, ding -- would satisfy the eight

of you?
MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, I'm saying that there's no

3

reason to assume otherwise, which is what Judge Drain did.

4

if you reverse the legal errors here, there is every reason to

5

think that that is a significant likely outcome.

6

emphasize that the States' interest in this case is not just

7

pecuniary.

8
9

And

I do want to

There is precedent from all over the country --

THE COURT:

Yes, yes, I know.

I don't want to get

into a fight with you the way Judge Drain got into a fight with

10

you about whether your interest is really pecuniary, isn't it

11

really pecuniary.

12

interest in what's going on here, but I have sensed, from some

13

things that have been said by at least some of the objecting

14

states, that while the United States Trustee is objecting to

15

this on principle, the States are objecting because there isn't

16

enough money; that there is a number at which the State of

17

Washington would join the other 38 states that have approved

18

this and say -- there's a number at which you would stop

19

standing on principle and say, fine, I'll take the money.

20

I understand that you have a parens patriae

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, I think one of the key

21

principles that we're after here is accountability for the

22

Sacklers.

23

of this process than they are today, is not accountability.

24

There are alternative resolutions that I think our States would

25

find count as accountability for our States' purposes.

Leaving them, as this plan does, richer at the end

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

And so,

42
LBUPPUR1
1

you know, I don't -- I don't think it's a matter of

2

compromising our principles.

3

THE COURT:

4

compromising your principles.

5

principles at all, but okay.

6

It's a fundamental --

I don't think it's a matter of

MR. PURCELL:

It's not compromising your

I guess I just want to emphasize that

7

State police power claims, the precedent, including the Second

8

Circuit decision in the MBTE litigation, emphasize that State

9

police power claims are primarily about punishing wrongdoing

10

and deterring future wrongdoing.

11

And here, what you have through these releases, is the

12

Sacklers largely escaping accountability for their role in this

13

horrific nationwide crisis, and that is what the States are

14

objecting to.

15

But, your Honor, I do want to just quickly point out

16

that you asked about insurance coverage, and the debtor's

17

brief, at page 86, note 18, says that there was debtor --

18

sorry, director and officer insurance from 2005 to '15, but it

19

doesn't cite any citation for that.

20

And it says that there were no claims filed, no opioid

21

claims filed against the policy during that time.

22

presumably, if there really was insurance, there would be no

23

coverage because no claims were filed; so I guess I just ask

24

you to keep that in mind.

25

THE COURT:

So,

Well, it depends on whether it's a claims

made policy or --

It's not in the record.

It's not in

whether it's a claims made policy or not.

Fair enough, your Honor.

I guess I would just ask --

I would find it odd if a D and O policy

were limited to claims made during the active life policy.
MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, I believe the main policy

10

that is in the record at Appendix 1305 required that claims be

11

filed within a limited period of time.

12

that policy --

13

THE COURT:

of time in the main policy.

something similar, after the policy ended.

21

further questions about topics I have covered, I will turn it

unclear that the claim against Suzie is not released.

23

MS. KINDALL:

So let's look at the

Well, within 10.7 itself, it says

24

there's an exclusion for non-opioid excluded claims, but

25

there's nothing in the release language that says but there are
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

47
LBUQpur2

also a category of opioid related excluded claims.

2

THE COURT:

Except that they're only released under

3

the language of the most recent iteration, the 13th draft, or

4

whatever it is, of 10.7 if Purdue's conduct is a legally

5

relevant factor.

6

MS. KINDALL:

And a legally relevant factor came from

7

Quigley, and it wasn't dealing with releases at all.

8

dealing with factual versus legal causation, and it is not a

9

defined term.

Moreover, the Sacklers were very clear that the

10

intent of this release was to release everybody from

11

everything.

12
13

It was

THE COURT:

Well, that was their intent.

That wasn't

exactly what they got.

14

MS. KINDALL:

I think it is what they got, your Honor,

15

and I would ask you to take a look at the number of people who

16

are being released or, perhaps better put, who isn't being

17

released because the whole world is released, and there is no

18

linkage --

19

THE COURT:

I'm not released.

20

MS. KINDALL:

It's people who are yet unborn, all the

21

heirs.

22

and it's not just sort of one source of the releases.

23

The list of who is being released is truly astonishing,

THE COURT:

The only claim that you could have against

24

the unborn is a claim of either fraudulent conveyance or unjust

25

enrichment.

The only claim that could exist against someone
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

MS. KINDALL:

And, your Honor, you know, if the

release was a narrow tailored release for a specific releasees

3

who actually have contributed, who are covered by insurance,

4

who are indemnified, who whatever, then the gatekeeping

5

function you could say, okay, you can see where it would be

6

appropriate.

7

know, as broad as broad can be covering literally thousands of

8

people where Purdue, which, you know, the debtor bears the

9

burden of saying why this is -- they're subject to --

10

But where you have a release that is as, you

THE COURT:

I'm curious about the jurisdiction of the

11

bankruptcy court to be a gatekeeper.

Furthermore, it's not

12

even going to be Judge Drain because you've driven him into

13

retirement.

So it's going to be some other bankruptcy judge.

14

MS. KINDALL:

15

THE COURT:

That's correct, your Honor.

And I'm not familiar with this gatekeeping

16

concept with the notion that you go and ask someone for

17

permission to file a claim.

18

in bankruptcies?

Is this something that gets done

What's the authority for it?

19

MS. KINDALL:

My understanding is that it is not

20

necessarily done in bankruptcy.

In fact, it was rejected in

21

the Johns-Manville III decision.

And so whether, you know,

22

what the authority of it is, I assume they would say would be

23

the general authority of the court.

24

questionable, but -- and maybe in a limited fashion there might

25

be something, but this is too broad.

I would say that is

There is no time limit on this release.

So, ten years

from now, someone is going to have to go to bankruptcy court

Judge Drain used the best interest test in

THE COURT:

Look, maybe you're supposed to be

12

hypertechnical in the bankruptcy context, but Judge Drain

13

found -- and I have no reason to question this finding -- that

14

so far trillions of dollars of claims have been asserted

15

against Purdue and the Sacklers.

16

MS. KINDALL:

No, your Honor.

All that's in the

17

record below you is that trillions of dollars of claims have

18

been asserted against Purdue.

19

THE COURT:

20

MS. KINDALL:

Okay.
There is no evidence whatsoever on the

21

value of the claims against the Sacklers.

22

that there is no evidence whatsoever on the claims against the

23

Sacklers, you couldn't possibly do the balancing test required

24

by the best interest standard.

25

THE COURT:

And given the fact

Well, you're saying that Judge Drain could

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

52
LBUQpur2
1

not -- it was not in his power to say I got trillions of

2

dollars of claims here against Purdue, which has, I don't know,

3

a billion six in the kitty.

4

least the officers, directors and managers of Purdue who are

5

members of the Sackler family have been or are going to be sued

6

on those claims because that's what always happens.

7

And I can hypothesize that at

And if Purdue is being sued for trillions, I can

fairly assume the Sacklers are being sued for more than

11 billion.

And you're saying Judge Drain couldn't -- I mean,

10

you don't need direct evidence.

circumstantial evidence.

12

There's no evidence.

And,

It's the debtors' burden.

I'm not suggesting that it was your

burden.

I'm saying that -- your position is there is literally

23

not enough evidence in the record about the tsunami of

24

litigation and the value of the claims that are being asserted

25

just in the class actions, that Judge Drain could not fairly

infer that the Sacklers, like Purdue, would be wiped out by all

those claims.

MS. KINDALL:

No, he could not.

And, moreover, there

is no evidence what would happen in a Sackler individual

are not declaring bankruptcy.

provided because they are saying, and if your Honor, if the

release had been completely consensual to complete, it's a

13

litigation release.

14

but it's not consensual, and it's not being done in litigation.

15

It's being done in bankruptcy with all the power of the

10

First point:

California joins in their

I don't think the 523(a)(7) point can be

11

overstated, particularly in light of California law.

It is

12

absolutely 100 percent beyond any dispute it's Black Letter Law

13

that California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising

15

automatically non-dischargeable if those Sacklers were to file

18

by piggybacking off the corporate bankruptcy, the Sackler

19

individuals can override what the bankruptcy code expressly

20

forbids in a personal bankruptcy.

55

the order confirming the plan.

2

Second, I want to respond to your Honor's question

3

about what you can do if there is a Stern v. Marshall problem.

4

We believe there is one, and I won't rehash that legal

5

argument.

6

run-of-the-mill state law claims that are released under a

7

plan, your Honor may be able to adopt Judge Drain's conclusions

8

of law and findings of fact.

9

I'm going to be really honest.

I think

I think it's a really close call.

Thankfully, we don't need to go there with the states'

10

claims.

11

to police powers claims, like those California has asserted

12

against the Sacklers.

13

cannot be removed to federal court.

14

of the Stern argument if it's successful is that by releasing

15

claims, the court is entering a final judgment on them, but

16

1452(a) expressly forbids this Court from entering a final

17

judgment on California State Law Police Powers claims that are

18

pending in California State Court because they would need to be

19

removed to this court in order to enter a final judgment on

20

them.

21

powers claims, I do not believe this Court can simply adopt

22

Judge Drain's --

23

Congress has already spoken on the issue with respect

1452(a) expressly forbids that.

THE COURT:

really interesting point.

2

adjudication purposes that is equivalent to entering final

3

judgment.

4

a final judgment, but that doesn't -- the fact that it has the

5

same downstream impact doesn't turn it into a final judgment,

6

so I'm having a hard time understanding why the bar against

7

removal is applicable here.

9

I know that for former

It has the same downstream impact as having entered

MR. ESKANDARI:

So I think Stoll, the Supreme Court

Those two decisions say that by

MR. ESKANDARI:

23

we agree that, yes, an actual final judgment, a piece of paper

overarching constitutional principles quickly that apply and

then answer two of your Honor's questions.

What I thought I would do is simply address sort of the

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

58
LBUQpur2
1

So let me start with the Constitution.

2

THE COURT:

By the way, you weren't here when I was

3

giving appearance.

Your brief was super.

4

brief that you filed this morning.

Super.

Thank you.

The

It's a great brief.

5

MR. EDMUNDS:

Thank you, your Honor.

6

The Constitution -- the constitutional principle of

7

federalism is likely the least reachable issue before the

8

Court.

9

Court should avoid; but it is one that governs and is sort of

It is the one, as your Honor said this morning, the

10

an overarching principle that applies to the statutory

11

arguments that your Honor is considering, including whether the

12

bankruptcy code provides the power to grant these releases of

13

state police power claims and whether the bankruptcy court had

14

subject matter jurisdiction.

15

The law -- and I won't go into detail of the law we've

16

laid out in our brief, but there are three strands of

17

constitutional jurisprudence that the releases here violate.

18

The first is simply the fact that when the court has held in

19

cases like Lopez in cases like Morrison, in cases like the

20

Sebelius case on the Affordable Care Act, but when Congress

21

goes too far, even if it's acting under the logical extent of

22

its powers, even if there is some logical connection or some

23

factual connection, such as the connection to interstate

24

commerce that was proven in Lopez and in Morrison, when it gets

25

into traditional state powers, that's territory in which
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

59
LBUQpur2
1

Congress can't enter.

And we think in this case given that the

2

bankruptcy clause gives Congress the power to regulate the

3

subject of bankruptcies, that when Congress or -- when Congress

4

to the bankruptcy court pursuant to an act of Congress intrudes

5

on state police power claims with respect to non-debtors,

6

individuals who are not the subject of bankruptcies, who are

7

not within the principles or the history that the Court went

8

through in Katz, that it reaches too far and it disrupts the

9

state's power to regulate conduct.

10

There are also cases that we have cited like New York

11

v. The United States and Printz v. The United States and other

12

cases that hold that Congress cannot and the bankruptcy court

13

cannot pursuant to act of Congress interfere or direct state

14

activities.

15

cannot require the states to adopt certain policies.

16
17

The court cannot -- Congress cannot and the court

It cannot use the states to implement national policy,
which it's done here.

18

It cannot affect the state's property rights.

19

It cannot force the states to spend money.

20

It cannot force the states to give up property rights.

21

It can't force the states to take title, all of which

22
23

it does here.
And, finally, the Court has said that the judicial

24

power does not extend to making decisions whether to settle,

25

especially when those decisions are in the hands of state
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

60
LBUQpur2
1
2

executive branch officials.

The

Court can certainly adjudicate the state's claims

3

against the Sacklers.

4

for the states that is vested in their executive branches to

5

settle those claims, and all of this -- so, there's three

6

principles that are at work here, and there is extensive case

7

law that supports that.

8

going on in this case, what confirmation of the plan in this

9

case does is to strip the states of important law enforcement

10

powers that we believe -- and that's why we are here and have

11

been here in the bankruptcy court and now this court -- are

12

necessary to protect the public from harm.

13

doing it.

14

What it cannot do is make the decision

But all of this is to say that what is

That is why we're

There is perhaps an amount, as your Honor asked this

15

morning, at which every state would agree, but what is critical

16

is that the amount hasn't been reached, and that our state

17

policies are interfered with.

18

legislature has provided for the penalties, but our powers are

19

not fully implemented unless they are significant enough to

20

deter conduct.

21

We've provided for -- our

In our supplemental brief this morning, I cited the

22

precise statement by the legislature that our statute is

23

designed to effect deterrence, and that is really what is at

24

stake here.

25

Purdue, but deterrence of all who in the future would commit

Deterrence not just of the Sacklers, not just of

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

61
LBUQpur2
1

this conduct, and, of course, the conduct is not limited to

2

these actors directly at issue in this case alone.

3

So what we would submit is going on here is actually

4

an abuse that is more substantial, worse than the one that

5

Judges Jacobs and Wesley warned against in Metromedia and

6

Manville III.

7

mechanism that is designed to promote and protect the public

MR. EDMUNDS:

I'm not suggesting you shouldn't, your

They will be last, I promise you.
I'm sorry?

They will be last, except for possibly the

bear in the Canadian woods which has eaten me.
MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, I think generally it is

20

appropriate to avoid hard constitutional questions when the

21

basis can be found in statutory interpretation which ought to

22

be guided by constitutional principles anyway.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. EDMUNDS:

25

That's a good way of putting it.
And I would note that for reasons we've

cited in our briefs, and the other states have cited in their
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

62
LBUQpur2
1

briefs, there's really no reason to think there's no express

2

language authorizing the releases that Congress intended to

3

release at least state police power claims against non-debtors.

4

In this case where the states are involved and where law

5

enforcement is involved, there is definitely a stronger case

6

against releases than in other cases.

7

I would turn to SPV just to address your Honor's

8

question earlier.

I think the Court is correct that SPV and

9

conditioning jurisdiction on the outcome of a future case is

10

attenuated.

11

the facts of SPV, if they were presented here, the Court would

12

have to follow it under stare decisis.

13

though is whether -- the Court does not have to extend SPV.

14

The facts here are more attenuated for the reasons we've shown

15

in the supplemental brief and in our other briefs, that there

16

is no claim for statutory indemnity under the statutes under

17

which we and the other states have proceeded, and that any

18

contractual indemnity, one, is illusory because both the

19

insurance policies that we've been through and the partnership

20

agreement condition the right to indemnity on things like good

21

faith, which cannot possibly be shown.

22

But I think the Court is also correct that under

THE COURT:

What is not clear here

And that's why I keep asking about

23

recoupment because I know that you've accused the Sacklers,

24

whom you've sued, the ones you've sued, the seven, eight or

25

nine of them.

It's not the whole group, you've accused them of
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

63
LBUQpur2

taking actions in bad faith.

And I've certainly seen in the

2

evidence in the record what you would present or at least some

3

of what I would assume you would present to a trier of fact to

4

establish that claim.

5

The claim hasn't been established yet.

It has not

6

been established yet that they have acted in bad faith.

7

fact that you say so doesn't make it so.

9

do that.

So that's why I ask about recoupment.

Ultimately, if

17

you can get all of that money back, I suppose, money goes out,

18

but if it has to come back in at the end of the day, if you

19

win, if the outcome of your case is in your favor, not their

20

favor, then the outcome of the contingent case would not seem

21

to have any permanent impact on the res of the estate.

necessary.

15

But even if that were to happen, even if money were to

16

go out, I think the Court is correct that what we're dealing

17

here with is trying to predict the ultimate outcome in the end,

18

and the fact that it would come back -- and that's not unusual

19

in a bankruptcy case.

20

goes on, and I think that's what SPV also sort of indicates

21

that the Court should do.

22

In fact, that's something that regularly

But the fact it would come back, the fact there is a

23

questionable right anyway, and the fact even if it would go out

24

in advance of its termination of that right and would

ultimately would come back means that there isn't an affect on

THE COURT:

There is an effect; there is ultimately no

effect?
MR. EDMUNDS:

Ultimately none.

The bankruptcy court

5

regularly deals with the need to reduce probabilities to

6

present circumstances to determine what the outcome might be,

7

what is at stake now, and the value of such claim for

8

indemnification is zero under facts that, granted, the

9

bankruptcy court did not resolve them around page 99 to 101 of

10

the bankruptcy court's bench ruling, the bankruptcy court

11

acknowledges that there could be substantial liability, and

12

that from the evidence it heard, there is sufficient evidence

13

to support -- it would be a question for trial, but there would

14

be evidence to go forward to establish that the Sacklers are

15

directly liable.

16

THE COURT:

Oh, yeah.

Well, and you've got three

17

district courts I think who already -- three state trial courts

18

that have already said these claims can go forward.

complaints are not dismissible on their face.

Right.

There's a reason -- to use Judge Pooler's

22

term, there's a reasonable legal basis for you to proceed

23

against the Sacklers.

24

is there a reasonable legal basis for them to assert a

25

contingent claim over against Purdue?

The issue, however, from my perspective

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

66
LBUQpur2

2

MR. EDMUNDS:

I think that that requires examining the

law and the documents.

3

THE COURT:

That's why I asked you for the briefs.

4

MR. EDMUNDS:

So we provided that in our briefs, but I

5

think there is no reasonable legal basis to think that the

6

Sacklers will come out of this with indemnity from Purdue for

7

what they directed Purdue to do, what were their acts for which

8

Purdue is liable in respondeat superior.

9

THE COURT:

That, by the way, was another clever

10

notion that I hadn't thought of, that what we're really dealing

11

with here is not -- is Purdue being liable on a respondeat

12

superior basis for the acts of the Sacklers, not the Sacklers

13

being liable for the acts of Purdue derivatively.

14

MR. EDMUNDS:

Well, we think that's what in this case

15

is at stake and a lot of cases brought under our statute and a

16

lot of other states' statutes, really the corporation is a

17

legal fiction.

18
19

THE COURT:

All corporations are legal fictions.

They're persons, but they're legally fictitious persons.

Please continue.

10

MR. EDMUNDS:

Thank you, your Honor.

11

I quickly wanted to address the issue of necessity

12

under Metromedia.

13

where it says that if necessity for the plan itself is the

14

standard alone, then virtually every case that comes up will

15

satisfy the requirements of Metromedia because you can simply

16

build it into the plan, as has happened here, but it has to be

17

something more than that, and I think that's the issue.

18

I think the Court gets it right in Karta

There is no question that the releases are built into

19

this plan here and have shaped what the parties have done.

20

that can't alone be sufficient to justify confirming the

21

releases here because it would be in every case, and because it

22

would give rise to the same abuse that the Second Circuit has

23

repeatedly warned against.

24
25

THE COURT:

But

Well, Karta -- you know, Karta was sort of

present at the creation.

I'm not familiar because I don't practice bankruptcy law.
And I have to say, it was my understanding from the

Supreme Court's decision in Executive Benefit that if I were to

make that determination and then were to review everything,

5

facts as well as law de novo, that it would be no harm no foul.

Am I wrong about that?

that I would need to do other than review de novo?

you've had notice.

that's what the Supreme Court was saying was, okay, if all that

happened and the district court reviewed the matter de novo, I

18

think that's what Justice Thomas was saying in Executive

You've done that.

You've filed briefs.

not made?

2

MS. KINDALL:

We have made arguments that, for

3

example, in the best interest test that there is insufficient

4

evidence to support the legal conclusion because it's all based

5

on conjecture, speculation and the --

THE COURT:

And you made that argument.

7

MS. KINDALL:

Right, and we made that argument.

8

so did there need to be further evidence taken or further

expiration of that, we would need to go through it.

And

I also

10

believe, your Honor, that our colleague from the DOJ is going

11

to address that issue as well.

Mr. Cecere, remember, we're speaking

MR. CECERE:

Yes, ma'am.

At the outset of this case, the Court asked the

parties to identify exactly which non-debtors' claims would be

subject to the plan's releases but be beyond the Court's power

to release.

perhaps more than any appellant before you today.

belonging to the Canadian appellants could not be released

because of the unique features of our claims and the plan's

unique treatment of our claims.

We haven't answered that question, and it is us

entirely, that does simplify things considerably.

9

need to reach due process.

The Court

The Court doesn't

It wouldn't need to reach our

10

individual Metromedia arguments; it would only need to reach

11

the inequality argument we raise.

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. CECERE:

The inequality argument.
The inequality argument, yes, ma'am, the

14

argument that we were improperly categorized as general and

15

secured creditors, and we should have been placed in classes

16

four and five instead.

17

of the releases that's the categorization of our claims.

18
19

THE COURT:

22

So that argument I need to reach no matter

what.

20
21

That's the only one that's independent

MR. CECERE:

Yes, ma'am, you do need to reach that

one.
THE COURT:

Okay.

Now, if I understand your position,

23

vis-a-vis your claims, correctly, it is this:

The plan carves

24

out claims against Purdue Canada from the release, and it

25

carves out, I'll call them, Canadian claims from the release,
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

72
LBUQpur2
1

but you say Canadian claims are -- the conduct of Purdue is

2

legally relevant to the Canadian claims, so it doesn't really

3

carve them out.

4
5

Is that what you are arguing?

MR. CECERE:

My argument is a little bit different

than that.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. CECERE:

Good.

Then explain.

It involves the interplay between 10.7(b)

8

and then the separate exception to the releases in the

9

definition of excluded claims.

To get in to 10.7(b), a claim

10

needs to be based on, related to, or arising out of conduct of

11

the debtors.

12

cause, or the debtors' conduct has to be legally relevant or

13

legal cause.

14

two-pronged.

It also has to be legally relevant or a legal

That's what gets you in.

15

THE COURT:

16

MR. CECERE:

Wait.

Wait.

The exemption is

The exemption is what?

The exemption is two-pronged for Purdue

17

Canada.

18

Purdue Canada, they fall into the exemption, but there's a

19

further provision that says if they relate to the debtor, they

20

fall into the release -- they fall into the exemption unless

21

they relate to the debtor, in which case they're recaptured

22

again.

24
25

So it says, on the one hand, if claims relate to

THE COURT:

actually look at the plan language.

4
5

Oh, thank you.

MR. CECERE:

All right.

So, I actually don't have the

definition of excluding claims in front of me.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. CECERE:

But it's the essence of your argument.
The definition of excluded claims.

Well,

8

I mean, I can walk you through it.

The definition of excluded

9

claims Purdue Canada says, if a claim relates to Purdue Canada,

10

it is exempted unless it relates -- it's based on conduct of

11

the debtor.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

14

MR. CECERE:

Yes.

Purdue correctly.

That's a big ten issue.

Against Purdue Canada, then it is exempt from the

MR. CECERE:

THE COURT:

MR. CECERE:

22

If a claim is against Purdue

Yes.

But then there's a --

Unless -- unless what?
Unless it is based on conduct of the

debtor or the debtors.

And your position is that everything that Purdue

So that means that,

5

you know -- and it's because of the overlapping management

style that the Sacklers used.

meetings where they direct everybody all at the same time.

that's conduct that's based -- so, you know, that's based on

conduct of the debtor just as much as it's based on conduct of

12

So

Purdue when they're wearing both hats at the same time.
And I'd like to go ahead and walk through our claims
to give you a sense of how we think it works.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. CECERE:

Sure.
So when you take our Competition Act

15

claim, for example, that's pretty clearly not exempt under any

16

circumstances.

17

but it falls within the provisions of the release because it's

18

based on conduct of the debtor, and the debtor's conduct is

19

legally relevant under any definition of the term legal

20

relevancy because in our Competition Act claim, we're claiming

21

that the Sacklers acting through the debtors caused fraud to

22

the United States and that fraud reached Canada.

23

what makes out a claim under the Competition Act.

24
25

It may have something to do with Purdue Canada,

And that's

So that's legally relevant even if legally relevant

circumstance that is legally relevant.

to Purdue Canada, and even if you say it relates to Purdue

5

Canada, it's still based upon conduct of the debtor, so it gets

recaptured into the release.

THE COURT:

But even if it relates

So we think it --

I think the use of the word recaptured is

helpful.

9

11

They're doing tort feasers in that

I'm sorry?
I think the use of the word recaptured is

helpful.
MR. CECERE:

Yes.

I mean, I think it is -- a claim

13

goes into the release, it's exempted out of the release, and

14

then recaptured is the way we try to think of it.

THE COURT:

questions an alternate reason why you might read our

with conduct in or out or recapturing.

language legally relevant and legal cause to require there to

be a contribution and indemnity relationship in order for it to

MR. CECERE:

And when a claim alleges a violation of a

criminal law, like the Competition Act, and the act is

to contribution or indemnity.

and so there's no insurance payout that could be given for it.

And that is correct.

And just to put the

final pin on it, if insurance proceeds are advanced under

reservation of rights in Canada, Canadian law will enforce the

reservation of rights and allow it to be recouped later.

Problems like this are exactly why the debtors and the

Like, it's going to be extinguish utterly

in that circumstance.
But just going back to it, it's only the outcome that

5

matters in fights about insurance coverage because in a claim

6

that hasn't yet been filed, the people who are going to be

7

doing the fight, after the effective date of the plan, and when

8

we actually are able to file a Competition Act claim and give

9

rise to contribution indemnity, that's going to be a fight

10

that's going to be fought by Newco and the MNT and the

11

reorganized debtors.

12

It's not going to have anything to do with the

13

now-defunct debtors or their estate.

So there is no effect on

14

the estate, unless there's an actual outcome that does

15

something that affects the property or actually takes money

16

away from the estate itself.

17

THE COURT:

Well, the insurance -- Okay.

Forgetting

18

about insurance, let's just stick with indemnity.

19

I want to talk to Mr. Huebner about, Newco is not going to

20

offer any kind of indemnity to the Sacklers, right?

21

not going to be an LPA between Newco and the Sacklers?

22

MR. CECERE:

Newco, which

There's

If the releases stay in place, if their

23

releases of their claims stay in place -- and by "them" I mean

24

the Sacklers -- if their releases stay in place, no, there's

25

going to be no -- there's no potential for indemnity.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

4

That's in the Delconte

So, yeah, there's not -- going forward, with regard to

5

Newco, they're not going to be paying the Sacklers anything.

6

There's no money that's going to go to them.

7

can even try and claim a connection to the estate is connected

8

to their unsecured contingent claim that they filed in

9

bankruptcy.

10

The only way they

They're basically saying that, well, if we got

11

contribution indemnity, then we would have to -- then we would

12

be able to go into the bankruptcy court and say, well, here's

13

our unsecured claim, pay us our pro rata amount of $15 million,

14

which is going to be nothing -- but not exactly nothing, so it

15

would have some kind of effect on the estate.

16

But the debt is only about, again, the ultimate

17

outcome, the right of contribution indemnity.

18

time their contingent claim, right, was an actual claim.

19

that has nothing to do with the fight.

20

That's the only
So

You know, if Newco, the MNT, if they incur attorneys'

21

fees fighting the Sacklers over insurance coverage that isn't

really there, if they do that, then that is a debt that belongs

to Newco.

THE COURT:

2

MR. CECERE:

Okay.
Now, Judge, I'm running short on my time

3

because we've been talking, but I did want to mention one other

4

point, and I also want to answer any questions you have.

5

you really raised a really prescient point with regard to

6

Metromedia and the people who have channel claims, but I want

7

to emphasize that --

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. CECERE:

But

People who have what claims?
The creditors who have channel claims,

10

how it is unfair to them that they -- they don't actually get a

11

channeling of their claims against released parties.

12

get to channel the claims against debtors, and they don't have

13

a forum now to raise their claims.

14

think that could be a fatal problem under Metromedia.

15

That's bad for them, and we

None of it flows to us.

We

So you know, as the Court mentioned in Metromedia,

22

that famous law review article that we're all revolving around,

23

the only time that releases have ever been upheld has been when

24

the creditors get something in return.

25

Maybe some creditors

THE COURT:

Hi, Mr. Aronoff.

MR. ARONOFF:

THE COURT:

17

MR. ARONOFF:

I'm very well.

Just fine.

How are you?
How are you?

Thank you.

Thank you.

I just wanted to -- you know, I'm

mindful we're appearing here as an amicus, and I want to be

19

helpful to the Court.

20

out of the Court's questions before argument and a few during

21

argument, and then, of course, anything else that the Court may

22

have questions on, I'm happy to address.

23
24
25

I have a few discrete points that come

I'd like to start just briefly with your Honor's
questions 14 and, to some extent -THE COURT:

I took the numbers off.

So just tell me

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

85
LBUPPUR3
1

what the questions are.

2

MR. ARONOFF:

Sure.

This was the question that you

3

were also addressing to Connecticut, and that is, what should

4

the Court do in the event that there -- the Court finds that

5

there may be a Stern problem.

6

the committee notes for Bankruptcy Rule 8018.1 go into some

7

additional detail about what the Court might consider doing.

8
9

I'd just like to point the Court

Among the options that the Court has, would be to
proceed under Rule 9033, which allows for parties to file

10

objections, just as they would for an R and R from a magistrate

11

judge.

12

essentially accomplishing the same thing.

But the Court may also treat the parties' briefs as

13

THE COURT:

14

They're very fulsome briefs.

15

I think they have.

MR. ARONOFF:

Yes, your Honor.

I think they have.

Along these lines, I

16

also, of course, mindful of the parties own preferences for how

17

the appeal would proceed, but I think everyone would

18

appreciate -- you know, on the one hand, I understand your

19

Honor doesn't want to, you know, reach questions that may not

20

be necessary, particularly constitutional questions or other

21

kind of relatively abstract questions.

22

At the same time, I think having guidance from this

23

Court, in the event of a remand, would be very helpful, and I

24

think, you know, we would want to avoid a situation where

25

there's a relatively narrow basis for a remand, and then the
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

86
LBUPPUR3
1

parties come back before your Honor quickly.

2

everyone -- I mean, I'll let the parties speak for themselves,

3

but I think everyone would appreciate it.

4

THE COURT:

I think

Well, since you're my best friend, suppose

5

I were to decide that there was some infirmity with the

releases.

9

What would be the next step, remand or an appeal to

MR. ARONOFF:

Your Honor, I think that's a question

for the parties to the appeal, and the parties would have to,

10

you know, decide whether incurring additional delay and expense

11

of a further appeal would be worth it.

12

depend on exactly what the nature of the remand or the nature

13

of the error was.

14

THE COURT:

I suppose it would

I mean, I could affirm.

Is there the

15

possibility of an immediate appeal to the Second Circuit?

That's right, your Honor.

Okay.
I'd also like to address your Honor's

question about the restitution and the criminal case.
THE COURT:

Thank you.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

87
LBUPPUR3
1

MR. ARONOFF:

Yes.

So just to remind everyone of

2

where the criminal case is --

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. ARONOFF:

New Jersey.
Yes, and I was referring procedurally.

5

So the company has entered a guilty plea, but it has not yet

6

been sentenced.

7

there will be no restitution order in this case, and so as long

8

as the District Court in New Jersey accepts that plea

9

agreement, there will be no restitution, which I think answers

10
11

And the plea agreement itself provides that

the Court's question.
THE COURT:

Okay.

But as I understand it, assuming I

12

were to affirm the confirmation of the plan, the government is

13

going to kick back some portion of the fine, the forfeiture,

14

the criminal financial penalty, into the pot, which at some

15

point this afternoon, someone is going to tell me exactly

16

what's in this pot.

17
18
19

MR. ARONOFF:

Yes.

I'm sorry, I couldn't entirely

hear the last word that your Honor said.
THE COURT:

I'm sorry.

It's my understanding that

20

some significant portion of the criminal financial penalty is

21

going to get kicked back into the debtor's estate --

22

MR. ARONOFF:

23

THE COURT:

24

the plan is upheld.

25

That's correct, your Honor.

-- if the plan is upheld, confirmation of

MR. ARONOFF:

Yes, if --

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

88
LBUPPUR3
1

THE COURT:

And if confirmation of the plan is not

2

held, you're going to take your marbles and go home.

3

the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey is going to pick up its

4

$2 billion worth of marbles and go home.

5

MR. ARONOFF:

I mean,

Well, your Honor, I do want to make

6

clear, the order -- first of all, the action in New Jersey is a

7

separate criminal case.

8

THE COURT:

Right.

9

MR. ARONOFF:

I don't want to speculate about the

10

steps that the government might take in that case, depending on

11

how this separate case goes.

12

the bankruptcy court, the order that the bankruptcy court

13

entered granting the 9019 motion that approved the claims

14

treatment for DOJ's civil and criminal fraud resolutions, that

15

order, which is bankruptcy docket 2004, at paragraph 9 provides

16

that the criminal forfeiture claim of the United States does

17

not come into being until the company is sentenced, and that

18

sentencing has not yet occurred.

19

THE COURT:

Right.

But I do want to emphasize, in

I mean, it's one thing,

20

Mr. Aronoff, to say that it's a separate proceeding, but never

21

have I seen a criminal proceeding in one district so closely

22

intertwined with a bankruptcy proceeding in another.

23

MR. ARONOFF:

I appreciate the connection between the

24

proceedings, your Honor, but I just want to make clear for the

25

purposes of this case, that the consequences in bankruptcy of
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

89
LBUPPUR3
1

that criminal action are not yet complete and may not become

2

complete.

3

THE COURT:

To be clear, Judge Drain, whose overriding

4

goal is perfectly obvious to me, was to get as much money into

5

the estate so that it could be used for laudable purposes as it

6

was possible for him to get.

7

He was testy, I don't know if it was you or the U.S.

8

Trustee, about that $2 billion and the fact that the United

9

States was objecting to the confirmation of the plan on the

10

principal grounds articulated by the United States Trustee, and

11

echoed by your office, because if the plan were not confirmed

12

or were overturned on appeal, that there would be no obligation

13

on the part of the United States to give anything back into the

14

estate, which would reduce the pot by another $1.75 billion,

15

and the United States would pick up its marbles and go home.

16

That's how it seems, to me, Judge Drain saw this playing out.

17

MR. ARONOFF:

Yes, your Honor.

I think that, too,

18

that understanding, is speculative, and it overlooks, among

19

other things, most importantly, that the United States does not

20

have a forfeiture claim and there is no forfeiture credit a

21

fortiori until Purdue is sentenced.

22

sentenced, and as your Honor is aware from the stay litigation,

23

the question of when Purdue is sentenced and the disposition of

24

these appeals are, themselves, closely related and so --

25

THE COURT:

Purdue has not yet been

Okay.

All right.

Go on,

Mr. Aronoff.
MR. ARONOFF:

Thank you.

I do -- unless the Court has

10

further questions, I did have -- I just wanted to go back to a

11

few points that came up during the parties' arguments.

12

THE COURT:

Please do.

13

MR. ARONOFF:

So I have a word about SPV Osus.

You

14

know, we've raised due process and I, of course, understand

15

that the Court would, you know -- both, would rather not reach

16

due process and is obligated not to reach that point if there

17

are narrower grounds to get to.

18

THE COURT:

But --

It's not that I'd rather not reach.

19

just there are circumstances in which I think it would be

20

unwise to reach it.

21

I've got to reach it.

22

MR. ARONOFF:

23

THE COURT:

24
25

It's

On the other hand, if I tend to affirm,

Yes, your Honor.

I can't affirm without reaching it.

Let's

put it that way.
MR. ARONOFF:

Correct.

And SPV Osus, to outline, you

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

91
LBUPPUR3
1

know, ties together some of the points that the parties have

2

been addressing about related to jurisdiction, on the one hand,

3

and due process on the other.

4

That case -- it is worth mentioning, that case was an

5

action originally filed in State court that was removed to

6

Federal District Court and was before a Federal District Court

7

before it went to the Second Circuit.

8

there was the court was -- the Second Circuit was interpreting

9

the scope related to jurisdiction, but as we have argued and as

10

the U.S. Trustee has argued, that wasn't the beginning and the

11

end of the inquiry.

12

adjudicate the merits of the claim once it determined that it

13

had related to jurisdiction.

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. ARONOFF:

16
17
18

Circuit.

The Court then went on to actually

The District Court did.

THE COURT:

Second Circuits don't adjudicate claims.

They affirm somebody else's adjudication of claims.
MR. ARONOFF:

20

THE COURT:

22

Both the District Court and the Second

And --

19

21

And so what happened

Yes, your Honor.

Justice Ginsberg said it was our job to

prepare the record for the Court of Appeals.
MR. ARONOFF:

Well, the Second Circuit upheld the

23

merits determination of the District Court, which, among other

24

things, rested on a determination of whether there was personal

25

jurisdiction in a Federal District Court over some of the
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

92
LBUPPUR3
1
2

defendants.
So, if anything, although we take issue with the

3

breadth, which I'll get to in a moment, of how SPV Osus

4

interpreted related to jurisdiction for bankruptcy purposes,

5

the case also illustrated what we think due process requires.

6

If a claim is related to a bankruptcy jurisdiction --

7

sorry, a bankruptcy case, then, you know, there needs to be an

8

adjudication of that claim which is consistent with due

9

process, which is exactly what happened in SPV Osus.

10
11
12

On the question of the breadth of related
jurisdiction -THE COURT:

And since it arose in a bankruptcy court,

13

you're suggesting there could have been an adversary

14

proceeding?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. ARONOFF:

Well, that case went directly to -- it

was filed in -THE COURT:

Yes.

Well, that case was that case, but

these cases are not.
MR. ARONOFF:

Well, yes, your Honor, and it's possible

20

that the -- you know, it would depend on the particular facts

21

and circumstances of the case.

22

a case to be -- a bankruptcy case to be heard, in the first

23

instance, in the District Court if the Court withdraws the

24

reference.

25

But you know, it's possible for

But the point is not really so much mechanically how
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

93
LBUPPUR3
1

it would proceed.

2

whatever form, it must still be consistent with due process.

3

Otherwise, the court is not hearing a case, which is how the

4

jurisdictional statutes refer to the jurisdiction that a

5

district court or a bankruptcy court has.

6

The point is that, however it proceeds, in

You know, on the question of how to interpret related

7

to jurisdiction, I think the other question that SPV Osus

8

raises is, you know, if the language in that case is sort of

9

taken at face value and the result is extended, it really does

10

raise the question of whether there is a limit to the

11

bankruptcy jurisdiction that Congress provided.

12

here that, you know, because of the interrelated contribution

13

and indemnity or distribution -- I'm sorry.

14

THE COURT:

We've argued

I mean, every corporate bankruptcy --

15

we're going to get into this this afternoon, but I have some

16

issues with the uniqueness of this case.

17

case was unique because of the interrelationship between the

18

claims against the Sacklers and the claims against Purdue.

19

they're the same issue in every single corporate bankruptcy

20

that ever has been filed or ever will be filed, and it's an

21

issue that arises in every case.

22

that reason.

23

Judge Drain said the

And

The case is not unique for

That is the antithesis of uniqueness.

So I agree with you that if the language is taken at

24

face value, this could mean that there is limitless bankruptcy

25

jurisdiction over, you know, all kinds of stuff that's not
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

94
LBUPPUR3
1

specifically mentioned in the code.

2

MR. ARONOFF:

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. ARONOFF:

Yes.

And, yes, that bothers me.
Well, I think this starts -- and I just

5

have one last point that goes back to due process, and in some

6

ways ties to an argument that the States have made in a

7

somewhat different context.

8
9

Ultimately, we're talking here about interpretation of
the bankruptcy code, and the question is:

What is Congress'

10

intent?

11

that the parties have resorted to discussing, you know, basic

12

questions like, is there subject matter jurisdiction, or, in

13

our case, was there due process, it demonstrates that, you

14

know, if you have a doctrine like third-party releases here,

15

that is completely untethered from any kind of statutory

16

framework, then parties have to resort to these ultimate

17

constraints of things like subject matter jurisdiction and due

18

process.

19

And I think part of the reason that we've had to -- or

That, itself, demonstrates that the third-party

20

release doctrine, such as it is within the circuit, it really

21

mangles the bankruptcy code.

22

code, which provides for a special remedial scheme that's

23

extremely detailed, the third-party release gloss on the

24

bankruptcy code has no statutory framework, and so it has no

25

constraint.

In contrast to the bankruptcy

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

95
LBUPPUR3
1

And that's, I think, as I was saying at the outset,

2

that's the reason that we get into questions of, well, what's

3

the, you know, full breadth of the bankruptcy court's subject

4

matter jurisdiction, or what does due process require?

5

because pressure is being put on these, you know, basic

6

constraints on court power because, you know, the courts have

7

blown past the statutory framework.

It's

8

So unless the Court has any further questions....

special accommodations, as well as financial assistance.

It's unfortunate that I require

10

Please imagine my frustration that both of these barriers are a

11

correct result of the Sacklers malicious action.

12

I come before you today telephonically on behalf of my

13

deceased son, Patrick Ryan Wroblewski, myself and the people of

14

the United States of America.

15

I am not going to waste everyone's time with

16

everything that's gone on with all of the illogical case laws

17

that have been made up since 1789. I am going to tell you this

18

is all wrong.

19

These illogical laws only provide wealth for the

20

attorneys and the government with their outrageous fees and

21

linguistic gymnastics that are wasting a lot of time as people

22

are dying at an unprecedented rate from overdoses, drug-induced

23

homicides, drug-related suicides and murders.

24
25

I will just simply say the third-party non-consensual

12

releases for nearly 1,000 individuals and entities and failure

13

to give fair notice to the American people of these proceedings

14

is unconstitutional, a Constitution that was also illogically

15

made up for people to believe and has a gaping legal loophole

16

to allow every government employee to do whatever they want

17

with very little to no consequences because everything is at

18

their discretion.

Discretion in America equals freedom. How are we in

the land of the free with elected government officials abusing

their power of discretion? Just who in America is free with

12

prescribe me 40 milligram of Oxycontin in detox and told me I

had to take it. Then he discharged me with yet another

prescription. I went through years of mental torture trying to

pull off of the devil's drug.

During this time, physicians began creating a cocktail

of medications for the anxiety I was experiencing from my

amygdala’s need for more of the synthetic heroin in Oxycontin.

Let me do this.

Not helpful.
Let me jump to the releases themselves

because I think it is a great place to start.
It is because they have been misdescribed again and

16

again that they actually raised many of what seemed to be

17

questions.

18

exactly what we did when we were drafting them, and we made

19

sure that lots of claims like the ones your Honor worried about

20

in Karta and actually cauterized and took away in Karta, which

21

Judge Drain did here, is what happened.

22
23

So, let's talk about Suzie Sackler because that's

For any party to be subject to a shareholder release,
four different things have to happen:

24

One, they have to have a claim against the debtor.

25

That alone answers one of your primary Suzie hypotheticals.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

If

115
LBUQpur4

there's only a claim against Suzie because she dealt Oxy from

2

her dorm room, it is not released.

3

Number two, it has to be against a shareholder

releasing party.

We keep hearing that there are an endless

5

number of releasing parties here.

6

Honor.

7

because the original formulation that in fact every attorney

general in this room has used for most of their settlements,

9

which is the following ten companies and every one of their

It's actually not true, your

The reason Exhibit 10 has many entities on it is

10

respective officers, directors, affiliates, employees,

11

subsidiaries, etc., people didn't trust here, and they wanted

12

to actually see the list of the Sackler companies to know who

13

was being released.

14

uses for things that are categorical, as your Honor already

15

called them on, are things like heirs and unborn children.

16

course, there can't be tort claims against unborn children.

17

The Sackler left Purdue in 2018.

18

Almost the only examples anyone actually

Third, your Honor, is what is a released claim.

Of

So,

19

not only do you have to have a claim against the debtor, which

20

categorically deals with a huge swathe of things that have

21

never been released, but your claim has to be based on or

22

relating to the debtors and a claim as to which the conduct,

23

omission or liability of any debtor or any estate is the legal

24

cause or otherwise a legally relevant factor.

25

Judge Drain added in Ten-Seven (ph.), which is a lot like what

very good reason.

4

Quigley, Judge Drain said these things must be tied closely to

5

the estate.

6

Quigley and Quigley looked at the bankruptcy code, and it

7

looked at 524(g)(4)(A)(iii), which uses language a lot like

8

this because when Congress legislated when third parties should

9

be bound to releases --

10
11

And someone got it half right this

It came from Quigley, but it came from Quigley for a
Like you in Karta and the Second Circuit in

What language should I use?

THE COURT:

So he looked at

No, when Congress legislated when asbestos

was --

12

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, I was about to say that --

13

in asbestos cases, this is the language they came up with to

14

make sure that third-party releases were tied to the debtor's

15

conduct.

16

So, your Honor, the next thing though, because we're

17

not done yet, is that there are six categories of excluded

18

claims because people wanted to make sure that all sorts of

19

things like criminal conduct -- I guess if the Canadian

20

Competition Act is criminal, it's just not released at all,

21

period, end of story, which is a huge part of the police power

22

discussion that we will be having hopefully in a few minutes,

23

and there are lots of other exclusions, like income taxes,

24

claims arising after the affected date.

25

separate carveout for Canada my partner will discuss, and then

There's a whole

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

117
LBUQpur4
1

there's the non-opioid excluded claims, which I think, frankly,

2

was not understood well this morning, so let me make it easy.

3

Judge Drain said, This is only about opioids.

If

4

there is related conduct between the Sackler and the company

5

that does not have to do with opioids, I am not releasing it.

6

Judge Drain, I actually at one point after we got the audio,

7

screamed at the Sackler counsel several times during the

8

hearing and said, "If you don't change these releases the way I

9

am demanding it, I will never confirm this plan.

And if I did,

10

I would be reversed on appeal."

11

narrowed them again and again and again to bring them well

12

within the heartland of third-party release jurisprudence both

13

in this circuit and others.

14

So what the judge did was he

Your Honor, as you noted this morning, it all starts

15

with jurisdiction.

16

ability to hear this stuff, then we shouldn't be here at all.

If the bankruptcy court didn't have the

confused by that in Kirwan you specifically ruled:

"A confirm

10

third-party releases -- "does not address the merits of the

has third-party releases, which, as I will show you in a few

7

minutes, were found as a matter of fact about 15 different ways

8

to be essential and indispensable to the possibility of

9

restructuring these debtors.

10

The Court can reverse itself.

The Second Circuit chose to affirm on

Your Honor, let's move on to related to, because we

11

spent a lot of time on that this morning, and I actually think

12

it's hopefully going to be helpful there as well.

13

Your Honor, Celotex said that proceedings related to a

14

bankruptcy include suits between third parties which have an

15

effect on the bankruptcy estate.

16

went on to say -- of course, it cited Celotex and approved

17

Celotex and went on to say:

19

outcome might have any conceivable effect on the bankruptcy

estate.

21

the critical issue.

22

SPV, as your Honor noted,

In this circuit, a civil

The Court didn't say will have.

And that's actually

In fact, a Third Circuit in Pacor v. Higgins did say

23

will have.

It said, I need to find that the debtors will be

24

impacted whichever way the suit comes out.

25

said, we disagree.

The Second Circuit

We put in place a lighter standard for

jurisdiction.

2

As long as it might, that's good enough.

So now let's talk about applying that here because

3

what the appellants also don't call to your attention at all is

4

on page 342 of SPV.

5

contribution and indemnity, they then went on to say there's a

6

separate way that third-party suits instantly trigger related

7

to jurisdiction, and that's a high degree of interconnectedness

8

with the lawsuits against the debtors.

9

After they finish their discussion of

be so.

The test is, would that other lawsuit have any possible

13

lawsuits against the Sackler alleging that they controlled

14

Purdue, and that Purdue did terrible things, and 500,000

15

people's lives were maybe snuffed out by Purdue's conduct, but

don't worry, none of those lawsuits will affect the debtors in

any conceivable way.

That's actually what they're telling you.

18

And as you noted before, they chose not to challenge

19

any of Judge Drain's factual findings, and there are eight of

them, eight separate ones that end this discussion because,

21

your Honor, there were 41 witnesses at this trial.

22

were by the plan proponents.

an expert about the Sacklers' projected future wealth.

24

was the only evidence they brought to trial.

So, what did the evidence actually show?
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

That

121
LBUQpur4
1

One:

Are the claims against the Sacklers factually

2

interconnected to the claims against Purdue, which under SPV is

3

a separate trigger for related to jurisdiction.

4

said in Dunaway, your Honor:

5

clear in SPV, when deciding whether potentially time-barred

6

claims could have a conceivable effect on the debtor's estate,

7

even unsuccessful claims are those raised in subsequent,

8

untimely or frivolous lawsuits can result in the estate

9

incurring costs, which directly impacts the res of the estate.

10

Right?

As you

As the Court of Appeals made

That's not even the one, because the quote from SPV

11

about factual interconnectedness, it's literally this case, and

12

I quote from the Second Circuit on this independent ground:

13

"There's a high degree of interconnectedness between this

14

action" -- the third-party action with UBS -- "and the Madoff

15

bankruptcies.

16

establishes that the Madoff fraud occurred.

18

automatic stay, it is difficult to imagine the scenario where

SPV would not also sue Madoff and BMLIS.

20

alleges that UBS aided and abetted the debtors' fraud.

21

existence of strong interconnections between the third-party

22

action and the bankruptcy has been frequently cited by courts

23

in concluding that the third-party litigation is related to the

24

bankruptcy proceeding."

25

SPV can only proceed on these claims if it

quote from Dunaway, but you literally said, this is what SPV

2

teaches, and you said that it was related to jurisdiction over

3

a single lawsuit by a single county against a single Sackler

4

because even though the Sacklers -- even though the debtors

5

were not named as a defendant, as you said, the trial on harms

6

alleged to have been caused in whole or in part by the debtor

7

is related to a bankruptcy, whether or not they're named as a

8

defendant, because a judgment implicating the debtor's conduct

9

could conceivably alter the debtor's rights, liability, options

10

or freedom of action.

11

And Judge Drain at modified bench ruling at 103, 104,

12

96-97 and a ton of other places found that the actions against

13

Sackler are inextricably interwoven and would have a massive

14

impact.

THE COURT:

Yeah.

2

MR. HUEBNER:

But as Judge Drain found, modified bench

3

ruling at 111, litigation against the Sacklers would "directly

4

affect ... the debtors' ability to pursue the estate's own

5

closely related, indeed, fundamentally overlapping claims

6

against the Sacklers."

7

SPV shuts the door.

It says, "A potential alteration

8

in the liabilities of the estate and a change in the amount

9

available for distribution to other creditors is sufficient to

10

find that litigation among non-debtors is related to the

could claim that all of these suits proceeding wouldn't

possibly affect the debtors is beyond me.

already pending that name the Sacklers and related persons.

2

The notion that in not one of the counts in one of those

lawsuits brought under the laws of 35 states there's anything

4

reimbursable or insurable is completely untenable.

5

Your Honor, let's turn to Metromedia now.

So, we

6

already talked about Metromedia, and I'm only going to defend

7

it, I think, in part because what has to be kept in mind is the

8

Metromedia is the latest in a long line of unbroken Second

9

Circuit precedents that actually lead the way, in fact, for

10

nation and for Congress on the rare circumstances in which

11

third-party releases are in fact appropriate.

12

Manville I, of course, was the first case ever before

13

the statute was passed, and on which the statute was based to

14

say we know of no better way to resolve this terrible mass tort

15

than with this creative structure.

16
17
18

So, your Honor, what were the factual findings with
respect to the Metromedia tests, as it were?

THE COURT:

As I told you this morning, I don't find

anything unique about that at all.
MR. HUEBNER:

I know.

And I have five answers, your

Honor, that I hope will encourage you to change your mind.
Number one:

We had eleven organized groups and four

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

128
LBUQpur4
1

rounds of mediation in which the mediators priced the claims,

2

both direct and derivative, against the Sacklers and worked

3

full time for a year guiding us to a fair and value maximizing

4

resolution.

5
6

Two:

There are thousands of suits against the debtors

and almost a thousand against the Sacklers.

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. HUEBNER:

9

That's true in every mass tort case.
It is, your Honor.

And mass tort

bankruptcies are very, very rare, and in every one of them ever

10

third-party releases have been the solution, both within and

11

without the mass tort -- within and without the asbestos

12

context.

13

Your Honor, I think it is universally recognized that

14

if these are not the most complex Chapter 11 cases in history,

15

they're awfully close.

16

this day against the lawsuits against the Sacklers rest on

17

Purdue's conduct, that interconnectivity, it doesn't mean they

18

may not be directly liable, believe you me, but the allegations

19

are not that Suzie sold Oxy out of her dorm room.

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, the appellants tell you that there is no

MR. HUEBNER:

THE COURT:

Manville III is.

I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

Manville III is the governing -- Manville

III IV is the governing law in this circuit.

11
12

That is up next.

MR. HUEBNER:

I'm delighted to talk about both of

those cases, and let's just do it right now.

13

Manville IV is actually very helpful to us.

What it

14

shows is that where there is a claim that could not have

15

possibly been conceived of 20 years earlier, of which there was

16

no possible way to give notice because the Chubb in that case

17

would have had to known that the bankruptcy court would have

18

exceeded its subject matter jurisdiction and enter an unlawful

19

injunction and file a claim for that.

20

Travelers finds a stipulation that claims like Chubb were not

21

bound.

22

put 20 years earlier into regular first class mail and in

23

newspapers, and the court found that given the nature of the

24

claim, it was sort of like a triple futures claim.

25

they used the words it was unfathomable at the time, and no one

And 20 years earlier,

In Chubb, in Manville IV, your Honor, the notice was

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

I think

134
LBUQpur4
1
2

ever could have expected the claim would have existed.
Manville III I like even more.

I actually turn you to

3

pages 64 to 66 pages of Manville III where the court repeated

4

three times, three times:

5

is because the claims against Travelers have no possible effect

6

on the estate and do not involve the conduct of the debtors.

7

They said it again and again, and it's exactly right.

8
9

The reason there's no jurisdiction

If Suzie Sackler was being sued, she should go jail
and be found liable in damages, and it doesn't affect the

10

debtors at all.

11

We fit within Manville III and Manville IV extraordinarily

12

comfortably.

13

Those are not the claims that are released.

Your Honor, a better way to even hit the source of the

14

authority, because underlying a lot of the appellants'

15

arguments really when you stop for a second is this sort of

16

unspoken notion like that it's because they're illegal.

17

of what they say if you sort of stop for a minute, is really

18

the USD was very clear.

19

third-party releases are unlawful.

20

anywhere in this country except for two and a third circuits,

21

and that's because those circuits -- and I'm going to be a

22

little bit cheeky here -- I believe actually violated law in

23

reaching that conclusion, as I will now explain.

in fact there is a lot of law on this, and people seem to have

2

not read either the Bankruptcy Code or the bankruptcy rules of

3

the pages which they probably should have.

4

we'll turn to their last appeal, which is, were these releases

19

of the officers and directors improper?

20

we'll talk about a little bit later, because the trusts were

21

unbelievably misdescribed to you, but just as a matter of law,

22

in Metromedia, the court noted that the recoveries coming in

23

from the third parties don't need to go to the parties bound by

24

the releases and noted that in Drexel, none of the money coming

25

in from the parties getting released went to the parties giving

So, we are going to talk about the facts in a

Number two:

When Congress enacted 524(g) and (h) in

7

the asbestos provisions, there was something called public law

8

111, which was passed by Congress and signed by the President

9

of the United States of America.

While it does not appear in

10

524, it is not codified in Title 11, it is law of the land no

11

less than if it were.

I'm going to get into that.

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, that's exactly right, and

they said, don't read our affirmative decision not to do this.

You're not allowed to draw an inference because we want to let

the law continue to develop.

any other authority out there, that this isn't meant to

statement that says nothing shall be construed to modify,

MR. HUEBNER:

Here we go.

No. 3, your Honor, is the

text of 524(g) itself.

of third-party releases, it did not carve out governmental

4

claims, police power claims or non-dischargeable claims.

5

was right in front of them, and if they wanted to narrow the

6

Manville and Dalkon Shield injunctions they knew about, because

7

they liked the public policy that the Appellants are trying to

suggest to you should be right, they would have signed it into

the law and they chose not to.

Four.

When Congress did legislate in the area

It

The United States v. Energy Resources, your

11

Honor, the Supreme Court confirmed that 1123(b)(6), when

12

combined with 105(a), provides broad "residual authority

13

consistent with traditional notions of bankruptcy courts as

14

courts of equity for provisions and plans that facilitate the

15

restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship."

your Honor, was actually pretty radical.

And the Supreme Court said:

No way.

The debtor owed a

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

1

the long-standing notions of equities is enough, because 1123

2

says that a court can include any provision not inconsistent

3

with applicable law in the plan.

4

plan must provide adequate means for its implementation.

5

And 1123(a)(5) says that a

And, your Honor, respectfully, you ruled this already

6

at 592 B.R. 489, at page 511, where, in Tier 1, you held that

7

authority for third-party releases and plans is, quote, derived

8

from bankruptcy law, quote, flows from a federal statutory

9

scheme and is, as used in that case, accused the Appellants of

10

ignoring, quote, subject to 11 U.S.C. 1129(a)(1), 1123(b)(5)

11

and (6), 105, and 524(e).

12

And your Honor, a ton of circuit courts have ruled

13

this also.

14

v. Energy Resources, but the necessary or appropriate power,

15

coupled with 1123(b)(6), leads to the following ruling by a

16

circuit court:

17

the bankruptcy court to release third-party claims from

18

liability to participating creditors if the release is

19

appropriate and not inconsistent with any provision of the

code," 519 F.3d at 657.

the code, which is the actual test.

13

Manville I, I appreciate the principle, but the nature of what

14

the court was being asked to do was just radically different

15

than what the Court is being asked to do here.

16

MR. HUEBNER:

I would say it like this, because I also

17

am aware that I have limited time.

18

very fascinating conversation about that topic, but I'm going

19

to just move on from it, because all I have to say is this.

20

Every third-party release case has different facts, and in most

21

of them, like Drexel, which was purely about wanting to sue

22

officers and directors for non-dischargeable securities law

23

fraud claims, or Karta or Care One, the facts are always

24

different.

25

I think we could have a

But the test is always the same, which is, is it

essential, important, indispensable to restructuring?

If all

2

it does is bring money into the estate, you lose because that's

3

never enough, and that's one of the many limiting principles.

4

There is no bootstrapping because it's not just that we wanted

5

to pay creditors X cents on the dollar and not Y cents, and we,

6

like, sued someone and got some money, it's as I went through a

7

half an hour before, these estates cannot reorganize and there

8

is no bankruptcy solution that is viable, as per the sworn,

uncontroverted testimony and factual findings of the trial

court without this settlement for the eight reasons that I laid

11

out.

12

Five, your Honor, moving on from United States v.

13

Energy Resources and Airadigm, I know it because the DOJ told

14

me it is so.

15

on a brief that had the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of

16

the United States right there, third-party releases enjoining

17

state claims for hazardous waste to protect their citizens, are

18

lawful and appropriate.

19

deny them the stay and moot their appeal and not even let them

20

have their appeal, unlike what we're doing, which is being here

21

on appeal.

22

Earlier this year, in Exide, they told the court,

In fact, they're so good, you should

And guess what else, your Honor?

Every single one of

23

the eight Appellant States was a creditor on the docket in

24

Exide.

25

like the business deal, involuntary third-party releases

So I guess they're limiting principal is that when they

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

146
LBUPPUR5
1

against States are lawful and okay, but when, as you said

2

before, you wished the business deal were different, suddenly

3

they're unconstitutional and there's no source of authority?

4

The DOJ's briefs in that case are really pretty good.

5

No. 6, your Honor.

THE COURT:

Let's keep going with the statute.

I have do have questions about why the

U.S. Trustee is pursuing this so vigorously in this particular

case; though, U.S. Trustee insists that it's taken this

position in the past.

10

MR. HUEBNER:

11

in this case as well.

And they've taken inconsistent positions
We'll just leave it at that.

It's a weak argument.

But, no, it's actually a great argument

for us.
THE COURT:

That's right.

Their weak arguments are

great arguments for you.
MR. HUEBNER:

Because 105 is beyond black letter.

21

It's just that the injunction is not automatic, but is there

22

for the asking and the legislative history is the bankruptcy

the automatic stay.

Now, let's go to 523, because why don't we start at

It's just automatic.

4

the beginning of 523, which all the Appellants skipped over and

5

is a complete answer.

6

1228(a), 1228(b) or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an

7

individual debtor from the following:"

It

Guess what's

10

not there, 524, 105, 1123(a)(5), 1123(b)(6).

11

when the exceptions to discharge apply and when they don't, and

12

this is a "when they don't" situation, which is why --

13

THE COURT:

Wait.

Congress said

For example, 1123 is not a

14

provision that grants a discharge.

15

correctly, is a provision that says in order to be confirmable,

16

a plan must have these qualities and may have those qualities.

17

And it doesn't say a word about discharge.

18

MR. HUEBNER:

19

THE COURT:

1123, if I recall

Your Honor --

I'll bet, and you know the bankruptcy code

20

and I don't, but I'll bet if I went to 727 to 1141, to 1228(a)

21

or to 1328, that they would all be provisions pursuant to which

22

discharges are granted.

23

MR. HUEBNER:

And, your Honor, that's what I was

24

exactly about to say, which is, there are other ways, and

25

524(g) is the most perfect example, where parties get enjoined
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

148
LBUPPUR5
1

from suing other parties for very specific, tailored things.

2

Congress, if they were right, absolutely could have

3

said, should have said, and needed to have said:

4

injunctions and 524 injunctions and residual power injunctions.

5

And 105

They're asking you to completely rewrite 523 to then

6

say that their hypothetical new 523, that includes three new

7

cross-references, is being violated.

8

for that?

9

None.

What case do they have

What anything did they have?

No court in the history of this country has ever even

10

suggested that a 523 discharge regime has any conceivable

11

relevance to third-party releases under a plan.

12

explain to you why, because there are two reasons.

13

need reasons, because I have a code, but I have two reasons.

14

think they're really pretty good.

15

And let me
I don't
I

No. 1, in Manville I -- one of the other sort of

16

"through the looking glass" things about this appeal, is that

17

again and again and again I'm up here arguing things that were

18

argued to the Second Circuit and expressly rejected and, yet,

19

here we are again.

20

In Manville I, the Appellants said:

Dear Second

21

Circuit, this is a discharge of people who didn't go through

22

bankruptcy.

23

de facto discharge of non-debtor parties, not entitled to the

24

protection of Chapter 11, 837 F.2d 91.

25

Circuit's response, and I quote:

This is illegal.

They literally called it a

They lost.

The Second

"Before MacArthur's reasoning

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

149
LBUPPUR5
1

is that the injunctive orders do not offer the umbrella

2

protection of a discharge in bankruptcy, 837 F.2d at 91."

3

And Airadigm and a ton of other cases say that also.

4

523 is limited to discharges because there's nothing broader

5

than a discharge.

And Judge Drain ruled on this at length.

6

And then there's the other reason, your Honor, if you

7

want just pure public policy from an actual bankruptcy lawyer.

8

523 has 19 exceptions to discharge, not just these.

9

all over the place for lots of different things, and it's a

They're

10

massive shift in policy to say that somehow they're all

11

incorporated, which Congress certainly never hinted at, and no

12

court has ever hinted at before.

13

frankly, out of whole cloth.

14

This is all kind of made up,

But let me tell you what would happen in this case,

15

your Honor, to show you why this would be terrible public

16

policy, as well as outrageously outside of the ambit of the

17

statute.

18

What it would mean in this case is the following:
One.

Natural persons Sacklers have 19 exceptions to

19

their third-party releases.

Corporate Sacklers maybe have two

20

exceptions to discharge, maybe no exceptions to discharge --

21

sorry, excuse me.

22

Sacklers have 19 separate carve-outs from the third-party

23

releases under the plan.

24

two or maybe zero carve-outs from their third-party releases.

25

And what about the Sackler trusts, your Honor, where

I terribly misspoke.

Natural person

Corporate entities have maybe one or

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

150
LBUPPUR5
1

the evidence at trial showed most of the money was and are not

2

bankruptcy eligible?

3

because they actually get resolved under the law of their home

4

jurisdictions.

5

So they could never get a discharge

What do I do there?

So against the same pool of defendants, for the same

6

conduct, getting the same releases, I now have three completely

7

different structures, all because the States are telling you,

8

with no support, that 523 requires that plan releases of third

9

parties be limited, with no authority.

10

It makes no sense, and

it is entirely extra-statutory.

11

Finally, your Honor, is 1452.

In other words, they

12

try to show you things that they think are helpful to them and

13

none of them are.

14

THE COURT:

Of course they do.

15

MR. HUEBNER:

Well, I know, but the punchline is that

16

I respectfully don't think they're right.

of things that are just not there at all.

third parties, the -- it's not governing -- the relevant case

3

they only get to count as value in liquidation actual

4

recoveries that are estimable and not speculative.

5

For very good reason, because people have integrity,

6

no Appellant has ever even alleged in a pleading:

7

I would actually recover from the Sacklers, and it's more than

8

I would get under this plan, because that would be ridiculous.

9

I know what

There are going to be hundreds of trillions of dollars

10

asserted against the Sacklers if this all melts down, and the

11

estates, obviously, have all the estate claims, which are

12

potentially the best claims of all.

13

are potential recoveries against the Sacklers are speculative

14

and inestimable means they lose.

15

And then there's three.

With all due respect to the

State of Connecticut, which I love and is where I met my wife,

Judge Drain made like seven factual findings detailed about why

19

statute is correct.

20

To say that there was none and no evidence boggles the mind.

21

One, it is uncontested that in a liquidation scenario,

22

creditors recover billions of dollars left from the estates

under the plan, over $5 billion disappears.

THE COURT:

MR. HUEBNER:

9

I know what he found.

That's

Okay.

So let's -So, your Honor, I'm going to basically

wrap up, then, because I think I'm mostly going to get peppered

10

by your questions later, and there are, obviously, a lot of

11

appellees and actual victims who are the 99.8 percent, not the

12

.2 percent that are the Appellants.

14

But, you know, again, if it's relevant later, I have a
slew of other factual findings all based on evidence.

15

THE COURT:

I don't need them.

16

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay, your Honor.

Let me just say two

17

very quick things about due process because I think this will

18

be helpful.

19

check the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure because, in

20

fact, there are two rules that are directly on point to what

21

process is due when you are seeking plan releases, and we

22

followed it to the T.

23

The United States of America, apparently, didn't

Rule 7001(7) states that an adversary proceeding is

24

needed when an injunction is sought, other than an injunction

25

under a plan which, under the rules affirmed by the Supreme
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

154
LBUPPUR5
1
2

Court, do not, obviously, implicate.
No. 2 is 3001(7)(f), which says that if a plan

3

provides for an injunction, even if it is going to enjoin a

4

non-creditor, a total stranger to the bankruptcy, the court

5

shall consider providing 28 days' notice and, to the extent

6

feasible, a copy of the plan and disclosure statement.

7

The notion that we had to serve a summons and

8

complaint on everyone in America when we provided the most

9

extraordinary notice in the history of Chapter 11, with

10

87 percent of Americans getting five separate notices in the

11

whole country, hundreds of millions of people, as well as

12

obviously the million other factual findings I don't have time

13

for, that are all in the record, no one contested this.

14

And the U.S. Trustee, by the way, read their own

15

opening brief at page 10.

16

notice at the right time, which was the disclosure statement,

decided whether the notice that was being given was due and

19

appropriate, and no one said boo.

20

They never contested the adequacy of

To show up now, for the first time, on appeal with a

21

bevy of due process arguments, which again are really just

22

arguments that third parties should never be -- third-party

23

releases should never be lawful, right, because if I have to

24

serve a summons and complaint on everyone in the whole country,

25

and they each get to litigate the underlying merits of their
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

155
LBUPPUR5

claim, no one misses what they're really saying.

2

releases are unlawful because you always get to litigate the

3

merits of your claim, and you can never be bound to a

third-party release.

think seven circuits are wrong, and we're right.

And that is what the

10

creditors, including Frank Levy AGs, on the whole, and other

groups, insisted on.

12

So here's what's happening.

Purdue itself, if the

13

plan goes through, will plead guilty to felonies and will never

14

emerge from Chapter 11.

15

THE COURT:

It already pleaded guilty.

16

MR. HUEBNER:

Well, we'll have the sentencing accepted

17

by the New Jersey District Court and adjudicated in whatever

18

way that works.

19

All of Purdue's assets, which include not only its

20

pharmaceutical businesses that are the subject of these

21

proceedings, but Purdue's other subsidiaries, for example, your

22

Honor, make things like Betadine and Senokot and Colace and

23

magnesium products, lots of things you would see in your drug

store or in the hospital that are, to my knowledge, not

25

remotely controversial and have no things tied to them.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

companies, will be transferred to a newly created

what that means because that's where the details are.

It will continue to sell all of its medical products.

to happen.

4

such a critical point here, which is essentially the whole

5

company -- no, I'm not on my time anymore.

THE COURT:

MR. HUEBNER:

And, your Honor, that's

You answered that question.

Thank you.

Your Honor, that's what the reorganized

8

debtors are going to do, and the hope is that it will save

9

many, many lives and improve many, many more, and all of that

10

will be lost if the plan fails.

11

THE COURT:

Understood.

12

MR. HUEBNER:

Now, can we --

Now, your Honor, now is the time, if

13

you're still interested, in where is the actual near-term money

14

going?

15

THE COURT:

Yes, where is the money coming from?

16

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

So I have both where its coming

from and where its going to, your Honor.

18

from is as follows.

the balance sheet.

20

of that goes out to the various creditor trusts immediately to

21

start filling them and paying claims.

22

Where it's coming

There's a billion-one of cash currently on
On the effective date of the plan, a bunch

The Sacklers actually have to make a material payment

23

on the effective date, which is part of the cash that goes into

24

the creditor trusts.

25

I don't know where they got that notion from, you know, all of

So as somebody represents to you before,

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

162
LBUPPUR5
1

these trusts essentially get filled partially with the

2

company's excess liquidity, but very largely, frankly, from the

3

incoming funds from the Sacklers that are paid on the schedule

4

that are exactly lined up to the payment obligations owed to

5

creditors and negotiated for under the plan.

6

And so each year there is money coming in from the

7

Sacklers that ranges from 300 million in one year, at the low

8

end, to a billion dollars in one year at the high end.

9

money goes out to NOAT, to the tribal trust, to the hospital

10

trust, the third-party payer trust, the Truth Initiative, the

11

NAS monitoring trust, the PI trust and the PI's future trust.

12

And the

On the effective date, your Honor, we also have to pay

13

the $225 million DOJ forfeiture payment because, as your Honor

14

noted before, another thing about this case that is

15

extraordinary, leaving aside this appeal which is very deeply

16

painful to many of us, is that the DOJ settlement agreement is

17

an extraordinary example of project do the right thing.

18

What the DOJ did in that settlement agreement was they

19

said, we could sweep billions of dollars off the top and just

20

leave with it, but we believe in the mission of abatement, and

21

we believe that the State and local governments are best able

22

to help the American people.

23

met, we'll take only 225.

So as long as two conditions are

24

What are the two conditions?

One, State and local

25

governments get $1.775 billion for abatement.

It has to be

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

163
LBUPPUR5
1

used for abatement or there's no credit; and, two, that the

2

reorganized debtor operate as a public benefit company or

3

entity with a similar mission.

4

What the DOJ required, which is what the States wanted

5

and the other creditors all agreed to, is that the overwhelming

6

majority of the money and the value and the assets and the

7

know-how has to go out to abatement to save lives except for --

8

THE COURT:

Okay.

9

MR. HUEBNER:

-- the personal injury amounts that were

10

negotiated by the mediators with no involvement by the debtors.

11

That was done in Phase I, where the creditors went alone into a

12

room and figured out how to split up who got what, and that

13

lead to approximately $1.4 billion going to non-governmental

14

creditors and the rest to governmental creditors.

this case.
And I want to note, as a preliminary matter, your

12

Honor, the Appellants pointed out correctly that the Second

13

Circuit observed that third-party releases of these kind had

14

the potential for abuse.

15

in response, that doesn't mean they're not permitted.

16

warning, and it's a direction to courts that are considering

17

third-party releases, to ensure that they make adequate

18

findings that their releases are justified under the

19

circumstances.

20

THE COURT:

But as your Honor quickly pointed out
It's a

And suppose, just suppose -- I mean,

21

you're not suggesting that Metromedia said if you check off

22

these five factors but you think the release is abusive, it

23

should be approved?

MR. HURLEY:

I don't think Judge Jacobs was saying an

I think what it was saying is that

(212) 805-0300

166
LBUPPUR5
1

in order ensure that abusive releases aren't approved, the

2

court considering a release needs to make specific findings

3

that, quote, truly unusual circumstances exist that render the

4

releases important to the plan of reorganization.

5
6

THE COURT:

What if truly unusual circumstances exist

that render them abusive?

7

MR. HURLEY:

That's exactly what I want to address

8

now, your Honor, from a creditor perspective.

9

though, before I get to that is that, at least from our point

10

of view, that inquiry and the factual findings that we believe

11

Metromedia clearly requires, is exactly what Judge Drain sought

12

to do in the eight-day trial with 41 witnesses and page after

13

page of factual findings.

14

I would note,

Unusual circumstances, we think, abound here, your

15

Honor.

First and foremost, the cases arise out of the opioid

16

crisis, the worst man-made health epidemic in American history.

17

Unusually for a case of this size, there was no funded debt.

18

There was no bank debt.

There were no bonds.

19

The overwhelming majority in number and value of

20

claims in this case were made by plaintiffs and potential

21

plaintiffs with claims arising out of the opioid crisis, and

22

that created really unique opportunities and challenges for

23

everybody involved in the cases.

24
25

The opportunity was that Purdue had and has real
value, including as a going concern, including the cash on its
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

167
LBUPPUR5
1

balance sheet, and including its most valuable asset, which are

2

the claims against the Sacklers.

3

gather that value together and maximize it and distribute it

4

equitably among those different groups of plaintiff creditors

5

through the course of the bankruptcy.

6

And the opportunity was to

The enormous challenge and risk that I think we all

7

recognized from the beginning of these cases, is that instead

8

this would turn into a litigation free-for-all, where large

9

groups of creditors that had very different views of their

10

respective entitlements to the value of Purdue, would wind up

11

fighting each other in estimation or liquidation proceedings in

12

the bankruptcy court for years.

13

The cost of these cases, as your Honor is well aware,

14

are staggering, and there was a real risk that if that

15

happened, if the creditors could not come together to solve

16

these problems themselves, that the value of Purdue was going

17

to be wasted and go to lawyers instead of where it needs to go,

18

into communities and to help victims.

19

This is also an unusual case in that creditors knew

20

from the outset that if these problems were going to be solved,

21

they had to do it.

22

your Honor, this was a true creditors' plans.

23

we said that, or one of the reasons we said that, this isn't a

24

case where the debtors come up with a plan with maybe one ally

25

and try to push it through with all of their other creditor

This was not, and we said in our papers,

From the very beginning of these cases, the creditors

were involved in driving the cases, driving the negotiation and

crafting the plan.

6

and he was, of course, there, you know, front row seat for two

7

years -- were driven as much, if not more, by the unsecured

8

creditors committee and the other creditor groups than by the

9

debtors.

Judge Drain made a specific finding at page
He said that these cases --

10

One of the first things that the creditors determined

11

to do, your Honor, was to try to mediate allocation, to try to

12

determine how to arrange so that these warring groups of

13

creditors could reach agreement on how to split up the value of

14

Purdue, instead of going to war over it for, as I said, years

15

and blow through hundreds of millions of dollars.

16

They wound up getting two of the most well-known and

17

skilled mediators in the country, your Honor, as you know.

18

Just as a flavor, even though those were the candidates, it

19

still took weeks and weeks of negotiating just to agree on who

20

the mediators were going to be.

21

the level of disagreement there was among the different groups

22

of creditors at the beginning of these cases.

23

I'm going to give you just a flavor.

You can't really exaggerate

I only have a

24

few minutes; so I can't give you anything close to all of it,

25

basis in the case.
They disagreed with each other about virtually

12

everything.

13

mostly the States and the other government entities, believed

14

that because in some cases they were sovereigns, in all cases

15

they were governments of one kind or another, that it made

16

sense that they should just get all of the value of Purdue, and

17

it should be up to them how to distribute that money to their

18

communities and to their citizens.

19

Let me start with, for example, the public side,

The privates, on the other hand, could point to

20

studies that indicated that the overwhelming majority of harm

21

caused by the opioid crisis actually fell on the shoulders of

22

private personal injury victims and other private plaintiffs,

23

and argued that they should be entitled to in excess of at

24

least 65 percent of the value or more.

25

The DOJ, this has already been flagged before,
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

3

side and within the private side, but again, I have limited

4

time; so I will stop there.

5

And there were enormous disputes within the public

The mediation, ultimately, was hard fought, and we got

6

to a solution, but it was not a foregone conclusion.

7

the parties made compromises in that mediation, your Honor,

8

that I can guarantee you at the start of these cases, they did

9

not believe they would have made.

10

All of

For example, and Mr. Huebner just touched on this, the

11

States agreed, I think for the first time in history, that

12

every penny that they get from Purdue is going to be used for

13

abatement.

14

going to be us used for public purposes, all of the things that

15

happened with tobacco, that is not going to happen here because

16

the States agreed to it.

17

It's not going to buy any golf courses.

It's not

That was a big part of the fight.

The privates, with exception of the personal injury

18

victims, made the same agreement, all the money that's coming

19

in is going to abatement.

20

side made was, ultimately, it's going to take a much smaller

21

share of the Purdue pie than it believes it's entitled to.

22

Instead of 65 or 70 percent, it's going to get something like

23

20 or 25 percent of the value.

24

that, in part, because they are getting relative certainty,

25

fixed payments on a fixed schedule.

A big compromise that the private

That value is -- they agreed to

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

171
LBUPPUR5
1

Now, the agreements that came together, and there were

2

many other agreements that were related to the ones that I've

3

identified so far that are interrelated, interlocking with one

4

another.

5

the Sackler settlement and the Sackler contribution.

6

The agreements all could not have happened without

So first of all, the private side of things, the

7

public, of course, have express provisions that says they're

8

conditioned on the Sackler contribution.

9

and they didn't make any secret about it at all, they never

The States have said,

10

would have reached those agreements if it weren't for the money

11

coming in from the Sacklers.

12

And the evidence below, again, indicated, and it was

13

unrebutted, that even if the States had been willing to take

14

the deals without the Sackler money, that Purdue would be

15

unlikely to have been able to shoulder the responsibilities

16

that it had taken on to make the private payments on the

17

schedule required and to make the disbursements to the States,

18

the $1.75 billion in abatement disbursements, that were

19

required to get the credit from the DOJ.

20

that credit, then the DOJ gets $1.75 billion off the top of a

21

company that, as we just talked about, is worth maybe $1.8

22

billion.

23

And if you don't have

So the settlement was absolutely critical to the deals

24

that were critical to ensuring that the company could

25

reorganize, and there's no question that the release was
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

172
LBUPPUR5
1

necessary to get to that settlement.

2

THE COURT:

3

MR. HURLEY:

No doubt.
So the Sacklers have said, and I think

4

it's self-evident, that they weren't going to pay $4 million

5

without a release that provided them a release from most

6

Purdue-related civil liability.

7

I'm not sure there's a real dispute about that.

8
9

That was clear in the record.

It's also important to note, your Honor, it wasn't
just the Sacklers that insisted on a broad release for all

10

parties.

11

carve-out where only a handful of parties could continue their

12

litigation against the Sacklers, it would imperil the payments

13

that were supposed to be made under the plan to everybody else.

14

That also wouldn't be fair.

15

Creditors also needed all that.

If there was a

So there's no question that the releases were

16

essential to the settlement, to getting that settlement, and

17

that the settlement was essential to the allocation agreements,

18

without which you could not have a reorganization of these

19

cases.

20

of Metromedia and the other cases construing it, you have the

21

unusual circumstances that justify the third-party releases.

22

If they're not present here, I don't know how they could be

23

present anywhere.

So in that sense, I do believe that within the meaning

24

And I just want to close with one remark, which is

25

that the other reason that we refer to this as a creditors'
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

173
LBUPPUR5
1

plan, in addition to the creditors having to be key in

2

designing it, is that if it fails, if it blows up, it's going

3

to be the creditors who uniquely suffer the consequences.

4

There are 200 people dying every day in this country

5

as a result of the opioid crisis.

6

confirmed and proceeds, on the first day, hundreds of millions

7

of dollars could be made available to communities that need it

8

and people that need it.

9

Now, if this plan is

That's not going to end the opioid epidemic, your

10

Honor, but it is going to save lives, and it is going to save

11

lives beginning now, not two years from now, not five years

12

from now, or maybe never, which is the risk the Appellants want

13

to take.

14

and we urge your Honor to reject the appeal.

It will save lives now.

That's the creditors' plan,

15

Do you have any questions, your Honor?

Your Honor, I also have a limited amount of time, and

5

I'm going to try to focus on some very discrete issues.

6

will try not to repeat items that have already been discussed.

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. ECKSTEIN:

9

And I

Thank you, Mr. Eckstein.
I know your Honor is aware, but I think

it just is helpful to begin my presentation to reiterate the

10

fact that this plan is, as you've heard, the product of

11

extensive negotiations among multiple parties over many years.

12

It included negotiations with the appealing States, who

13

contributed actively to the creation of many of the uniquely

14

beneficial features, such as the abatement-related provisions,

15

the document repository and the structure and governance of

16

Newco.

17

Your Honor, I'm going to try to speak to four topics.

18

One, the importance of the shareholder releases to the

19

governmental entities; two, the planned embodiment of the

20

police power objective and how, in fact, the police powers are

21

ideally satisfied and recognized by this plan; the ways in

22

which the plans serve the public interest; and the plan's

23

consistency with recent Supreme Court precedent.

24
25

Also, in the course of my remarks, I will touch on
some of your Honor's questions; although, I think some of them
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

175
LBUPPUR5
1
2

have already been addressed.
Your Honor, to begin with, I'll touch briefly on the

3

topic that others have covered in some detail, which is

4

Metromedia and the importance of the shareholder releases to

5

the plan.

6

The Appellants have repeatedly attempted to color the

7

Court's view of the integrity of the release by stating, as if

8

it were a fact, that the shareholder releases were included in

9

the plan only because the Sackler family insisted upon them.

10

This, they say, undermines Metromedia's requirement that a

release be important to the plan.

12

Your Honor, the evidence completely refutes the

13

Appellants' arguments.

14

our brief, abundant evidence established that there were

15

multiple reasons why the shareholder releases were important to

16

and, indeed, essential to both the current plan and any plan of

17

reorganization, including the critical fact that, all but

18

ignored by the Appellants, that the shareholder releases were

19

important to the settling creditors, not simply to Sacklers.

20

As set forth on pages 21 through 23 of

The evidence could not be more clear that the release

21

was required by the States and local governments, who are

22

agreeing to a payment stream over nine years and are agreeing

23

to accelerated payments to the individual and other private

24

creditors, as you just heard described.

Without a broad release, there would simply be no way

6

by the States.

7

It seems obvious and self-evident that without this

The appealing States have also argued that no

8

consideration is provided to the States on account of their

9

claims against the Sacklers.

This also simply is not correct.

10

I would note, as an initial matter, that Metromedia does not

11

require any particular level of consideration be paid on the

12

enjoined claims, noting "such consideration as weight in equity

13

but is not required."

14

Metromedia at page 143.

More importantly, the settlements by the States and

15

local governments certainly took account of both the estate

claims and the third-party claims against the Sacklers, and

17

both were factored into the financial and non-financial

components of the settlement.

issue, which has occupied a great deal of the Appellants' case.

2

The Appellants go to great lengths to argue that the

3

third-party release improperly undermines the State's police

4

powers, but they do not provide a single concrete example of

5

how this plan actually does so.

6

The only real complaint is that the financial

7

settlement should be higher, a complaint we hear from

8

dissenting creditors in every bankruptcy case, but certainly

9

not a complaint that implicates unique State sovereign

10

interests.

11

features of the plan were designed by the States themselves and

12

where the plan actually operates to facilitate the States'

13

police powers, the police power argument is misplaced and

14

should be rejected.

15

Thus, in the circumstances of this case, where key

In thinking about this issue, it's helpful to consider

16

some examples of how the appealing States themselves have

17

articulated the interests they seek to vindicate.

THE COURT:

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Your Honor, if you

No, I'm fine.
Second.

The plan creates a public

5

document repository, which your Honor has heard about, that

6

will contain over 100 million pages of documents of the debtor

7

and the Sacklers families, providing key information and

8

insights to the public concerning the origins of the national

9

opioid crisis and roles of Purdue and the Sacklers.

10

The ad hoc committee's witness, Jayne Conroy,

11

testified that "it could be that the document repository is

12

actually the most valuable piece of this settlement."

13

THE COURT:

Yes, well, from the perspective of a

14

lawyer, that's probably the case.

15

victims feel that way.

16

MR. ECKSTEIN:

I doubt that the individual

Your Honor, I believe that the victims

17

have been very, very focused on this, and I can assure your

18

Honor that the States and local governments view this as one of

19

the most essential items to ensuring the enforcement of their

20

police powers.

21

The non-consenting States, including the appealing

22

States, were actually involved in negotiating the terms of the

23

document repository, as reflected in Judge Chapman's mediator's

24

report, and that was an essential ingredient to the last

improvement to the plan that was achieved under the auspices of

questions, the post-government structure and role of Newco is

discussed at length in the disclosure statement.

THE COURT:

I needed to hear.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

families to divest their equity interests in the debtors and

16

That is in the shareholder settlement agreement at

It was because of a foregoing provision, and others,

that the ad hoc committee, whose constituents share the

23

that were originally aligned with the appealing States.

24

The appealing States want more money, to be sure, but

it is hard to see how their efforts to overturn the plan could

in a manner that is hard to measure.

6

We respectfully submit that this plan is not in any
It is facilitating the goals that

Your Honor, let me turn to a final point I want to

7

address, the Appellants' contentions that the releases here are

8

somehow inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in

9

Jevic, which postdated Metromedia.

10

In some respects, I know your Honor has been asking

11

for the authority to grant the third-party release.

12

Mr. Huebner labored mightily to respond to the issue, but in

13

some respects, we also should ask whether or not the Second

14

Circuit's decisions in Metromedia and others are, in fact,

15

aligned with the Supreme Court's recent expression in a

16

significant bankruptcy case in 2017.

17

THE COURT:

18

MR. ECKSTEIN:

I know

That question had occurred to me.
It's actually quite surprising that

19

Appellants have cited your Honor to Jevic because that case

20

does not detract from Metromedia but actually serves to confirm

21

the Second Circuit's general approach to releases.

22

In Jevic, the Supreme Court rejected a structured

23

settlement because it violated the code's priority scheme, a

24

scheme that was "a basic underpinning of business bankruptcy

25

law."

But the court went on to acknowledge that there are many
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

182
LBUPPUR5
1

instances in which courts have approved various forms of relief

2

that are not expressly authorized by the code, such as

3

so-called first-day orders that authorize things like the

4

payment of pre-petition wages, critical vendors and other forms

5

of relief that --

6

THE COURT:

I thought it was interesting that Justice

7

Breyer, in Jevic -- so sorry to interrupt you, but Justice

8

Breyer in Jevic talked about, you know, first-day orders as a

9

procedural mechanism that allows a debtor-in-possession to be a

10

debtor-in-possession and did not mention third-party releases,

11

for example, a much more controversial -- I don't know that has

12

anybody ever suggested that --

13

MR. ECKSTEIN:

14

THE COURT:

15
16

Correct, your Honor.

-- that a DIP order is a violation of the

bankruptcy code.
MR. ECKSTEIN:

He did not mention third-party

17

releases, but he mentioned first-day orders and other orders

18

that facilitate a successful reorganization, and that was the

19

big distinction between the types of examples that were

20

described when the court went through the iridium case, as

21

compared to what was being accomplished or sought to be

22

accomplished in the structured dismissal that was being

23

reviewed in Jevic.

24
25

In distinguishing these scenarios from the structured
settlement before it, the Supreme Court wrote that in those
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

183
LBUPPUR5
1

other cases, the relief at issue "would enable a successful

2

reorganization and make even the disfavored creditors better

3

off."

4

would be better off.

5

releases do here.

6

A crucial distinction, that the disfavored creditors
That is exactly what the third-party

They serve to use Jevic's words "significant

7

code-related objectives," or to use Metromedia's words, they

8

are "important to the success of the plan."

9

And unlike in Jevic, where the Warren claimants were

10

being passed over and were getting nothing under that case, the

11

Appellant States in our case are full beneficiaries of the plan

12

and the settlement and, in fact, were participants in the

13

creation of the key provisions of the plan.

14

I would submit, your Honor, that the distinctions

15

between the scenario in Jevic, where the Warren creditors, who

16

were individual employees, were being excluded by the more

17

powerful and influential secured creditors, contrasts

18

materially with this case, where every single creditor

19

constituency has a seat at the table, participated and voted

20

overwhelmingly to support this plan.

21

the release is facilitating the goals of reorganization.

22

This is the case where

While Appellants claim that Jevic broadly rejected a

23

rare-case exception to the --

24

THE COURT:

25

MR. ECKSTEIN:

2

THE COURT:

3

MR. ECKSTEIN:

I read it.
While they rejected the rare-case

4

exception, this distorts the holding of the case and

5

inaccurately assumes that Appellees are seeking any sort of

6

"exception to the normal rules of bankruptcy."

7

Jevic may have said that there is no rare-case

8

exception to a rule as fundamental as the code's priority

9

scheme, but it went no further than that.

The plan here does

10

not seek an exception to any otherwise-applicable bankruptcy

11

law.

12

issue, whether third-party releases are permissible.

13

Unlike in Jevic, the code is silent as to the question at

But there is no doubt that the release in this case is

14

facilitating the goals of the bankruptcy code, which is

15

successful reorganization and equal treatment of creditors.

would urge your Honor to follow the guidance in both Metromedia

17

and the guidance in Jevic, as I submit, and to confirm the

plan.

priority under 507(a)(4).

8

726 of the Code, 507(a) priority claims have to be paid before

I just want to touch on where Mr. Eckstein left off,
Now Jevic case obviously had a

We had WARN Act claimants that had a

In Chapter 11, under Section 1129(a)(9) of the Code,

11

507(a) claims have to be paid in full on the effective date of

the plan unless the class of priority claimants agrees to

13

stretch out the payments.

14

So this was a statutory command, and although there

15

was some acknowledgment about, you know, some flexibility to

16

ignore the priority scheme, that is an important difference

17

from our situation here.

fashion.

2

Now, we've had a lot of discussion this afternoon

3

about where third-party releases can be sourced.

4

course, one of the first sections or provisions of the

5

Bankruptcy Code are 105(a), 1123(b)(6), but I would suggest

6

that there is another provision where it can be sourced, and

7

that's 1123(b)(3), B as in boy, which provides that plan may

8

provide for the settlement and compromise of estate-held

9

claims.

And that's what we have here.

And, of

We have a settlement

10

and compromise with the shareholder releasees of the estate

11

claims.

12

It was interesting, your Honor --

13

THE COURT:

Yeah, but we also have the resolution

14

of -- claims that are manifestly not the estate claims.

15

having a hard time with that one.

16

MR. LIESEMER:

17

THE COURT:

I'm

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear.

The objectors' claims, the appellants'

18

claims are not estate claims; they're just not.

19

Drain found that.

20

MR. LIESEMER:

21

THE COURT:

Even Judge

I understand that.

So a provision of the Bankruptcy Code that

22

authorizes the settlement of estate claims does not seem to me

23

to have any pertinence to the appeal.

24
25

MR. LIESEMER:

Let me address your point, but in order

to do, so I need to pivot over to Manville I and a point that
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

188
LBUQpur6
1

you made earlier because you're right, your Honor, in Manville

2

I, there was a risk of depletion of shared insurance.

3

didn't want those holding vendor endorsements to be able to

4

deplete and diminish that fund that was supposed to be going to

5

the Asbestos Compensation Trust.

6

shareholder releases in this case are important to prevent the

7

erosion and depression of settlement value of the estate-held

8

claims.

9

in a moment, but it's logical that if I am plaintiff A trying

They

I would suggest that the

Because it's logical -- and I'll get to the evidence

10

to settle with the defendant, the defendant isn't going to give

11

me as much money as I want for my claim if the defendant is

12

faced with plaintiff B, plaintiff C, plaintiff D.

13

So this is a device to help maximize value for the

14

benefit of creditors, and we have the evidence for that at the

15

confirmation hearing which was the testimony of Jane Conroy,

16

who is an attorney, who, for several years, pursued Purdue and

17

the Sacklers and other opioid defendants.

18

about during the testimony or one thing she talked about was

19

the peace premium, and that was the same point that I brought

out:

21

that you're going to receive if you can give complete peace to

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

189
LBUQpur6

Drain did at another point in his modified bench ruling, he did

2

recognize and credit Ms. Conroy's testimony, and although he

3

didn't necessarily point to it with respect to the Metromedia

4

factors and elsewhere, I think the evidence is there to be able

5

to rule in the alternative or in addition to what Judge Drain

6

found to be able to be able to rely on Ms. Conroy's testimony

7

as well.

8

THE COURT:

I get your point.

I want to focus today on one question; it was actually

the first question that you asked any of us, which is this

19

question of what are the direct claims and what are the estate

20

claims that we're talking about?

21

And to answer that, I want to focus on the direct and

22

derivative claim jurisprudence, one, to make sure we're all on

23

the same page about what constitutes a direct claim and what

24

constitutes a derivative claim.

25

least with respect to the personal injury victims, whether you

And then, two, to explain, at

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

view the claims as direct or all derivative, they're all

handled appropriately under the plan, the confirmation order

and the plan supplements.

Let me start first with direct or what are sometimes

called non-derivative claims.

on it.

others.

Non-derivative claims are

Two comments on that definition.

The question of

personality to the creditor is not determined as of or prior to

the petition date.

12

that the claims are derivative, there was a preexisting

creditor cause of action prior to the petition date.

15

The creditor had the right to bring an alterego claim.

not the right analysis.

2

have direct claims that they could assert outside the

3

bankruptcy court, do those claims remain direct in light of the

4

bankruptcy of Purdue.

5

The right analysis is, even if they do

Let me focus on the second part of that definition

6

which has gotten no air here, which is the second part, which

7

says that direct claims are of no interest to other creditors.

8

You've heard from a number of people, and I'll deal with in a

9

bit, the notion that personal injury victims or states or

10

anybody else has no interest in the litigation --

11

THE COURT:

There is no -- God bless the Second

12

Circuit, for you are dealing, as you always are, in a

13

bankruptcy within limited pot of money.

14

the other creditors don't have an interest in because every

15

claim reduces the pot.

16

as creditor A has some kind of interest in creditor B's claim

17

because it might reduce the value of creditor A's claim, that

18

it's not a direct claim, I don't think that's what's being

19

said.

20

MR. SHORE:

There is no claim that

No, I would say that in this case based

21

upon this record with the statements that you've heard from

22

everybody with respect to the creditors' willingness to go

23

forward in this deal without the Sackler third-party release,

24

and the risks to the deal if those claims are litigated, I

25

think on that record it is the central issue for everybody.

judgment against the Sacklers, we're at harm waiting for our

7

payments to come.

8

So I think in this case, given the centrality of it,

9

and the impact the litigations would have on these claims, I

10

think at least that fits within the definition of interest.

11

THE COURT:

I'm going to have to think about that

12

because I certainly did not read Tronox in that -- in the way

13

that you're reading Tronox because I just fail to see how if

14

you read it that way, it's not true of every single creditor's

claim against the bankruptcy.

16

MR. SHORE:

Again, we got into the issue with what

17

arising out of and conceivable effect has on it.

18

these phrases that get addressed in jurisprudence and everybody

19

does put limitations on them.

20

of this case, the notion that a third party could go out and

21

litigate a direct claim to judgment is of singular importance

22

to the entire creditor body.

23

They do write

I'm just saying in the context

Now, let's focus though on the claim that there are

24

direct claims.

Let's just assume there are collect claims.

So

Let me explain why that matters.

To answer your question regarding consideration,

Mr. Eckstein just read to you the section of Metromedia that

says:

I want to come back to that equity point and how it is

Consideration has weight in equity but is not required,

statements that the U.S. Trustee has cited in the TDPs

23

regarding the claims, the termination of the claims and our

24

counter-citing of the deemed satisfaction language in there.

The TDPs are injury-based compensation systems.

They are

not claims-based compensation systems.

To start, you need an opioid prescription.

8

But to be clear, that was a requirement of the government's.

What the TDPs do is pay injuries, not pay for claims.
Let me pause,

here.

12

As an aside, and I think it is, I want to address

another question your Honor asked that nobody seems to have

14

addressed, there is obviously looseness in the language legally

15

relevant.

language, but your Honor has the ability to provide more

context of that, what you believe legally relevant should mean

sues Sackler and you come up with different language and say to

5

Judge Drain:

6

someone comes forward, this is what I understand legally

7

relevant to mean, which means when he enforces that order, then

8

he has the ability to take into consideration this lack of

9

precision.

10

When you are faced with an actual claim and

Look, in fairness to all of this, this whole process

11

would work a lot better if we had an actual claimant with a

12

direct claim personal injury claim standing up to answer

13

questions from your Honor, and then we would be in the footing

14

we're in in Tronox where you have someone coming forward post

15

confirmation saying, "I've got a claim I want to bring, and the

16

court is able to, among other things, ask questions to the

17

counsel as to what is your claim and why are you pursuing it.

18

Now, going back to the TDPs.

If you have a script and

19

have filed a claim against the bankruptcy, the TDP is agnostic

20

to the cause of your injury or the legal merits of your claim.

21

That's another feature of the TDP that nobody has objected to.

22

It just sets points for levels of injury related to opioid use

23

for qualifying creditors.

24

not the claim is paid, and to effect that payment and

25

ultimately to be able to clean up the claims register, the TDP

The injury will be paid whether or

language is that all claims related to that injury are

2

satisfied.

3

Again, one injury, one claim, whether it was the

4

Sacklers that caused your injury at the end of the day or they

5

were the proximate cause or it was the debtors or it was 50/50

6

or whatnot, the injury gets paid.

7

trustee is arguing here is that for claimants with direct

8

Sacklers claims, the TDPs should add a function of additional

9

points for people who have direct Sackler claims.

What in effect the U.S.

That is, if

10

you come in and prove you have direct Sackler claims, you will

11

get more points and more recovery that won't be available to

12

people who can't prove up direct Sackler claims.

13

Now, the U.S.D. didn't even conceptually ask for that

below, and that's why I'm saying, had this issue been raised,

15

we could have had this out on the record below.

the United States found that the creditor could assert a claim

What the NAS committee has done, and much to

and immediate access to these documents by medical

professionals we hope will allow a standard of care to be

adopted in this country for NAS children and for those who are

10

13

Judge Drain obviously made a number of findings in

that regard.
Hearing nothing, let me -- Ms. Monaghan, do you have
anything that you would like to raise with me?
MS. MONAGHAN:

Just briefly, your Honor, one thing

14

that we would like to address is your Suzie Sackler

15

hypothetical and how Judge Drain's legally relevant qualifier

16

intersects with that.

17

So, on that front, I would say that the Sackler

18

release parties agree that Suzie Sackler would not be released

19

for the claim that you have in mind.

20

that's clear is because if Suzie Sackler did the exact same

21

thing with a non-Purdue opioid, if Suzie Sackler gave her

22

roommate Vicodin, she would have the same legal problems that

23

she has for giving her roommate OxyContin and, therefore,

24

Purdue's conduct is not a legally relevant fact to the case

25

against Suzie Sackler in that instance, and we think that --

18

Judge Wiles had this great statement in Aegean where he said we

don't give out releases to make people feel better.

20

there is no viable claim against Suzie Sackler, and no claim

has been asserted against Suzie Sackler, and none of the direct

3

MS. MONAGHAN:

What does she have to be

Your Honor, the reason Suzie Sackler or

4

any Sackler who didn't serve on the board of directors needs a

5

release, I think I can shed some light on.

6

There are basically five categories of shareholders

7

release parties.

8

structure underlying the settlement.

9

All of them are implicated in the payment

So, in my case, my side of the family, the side A it

10

is so-called, payments are coming largely from trusts.

Those

11

trusts have beneficiaries.

12

to the family members who served on Purdue's board.

13

trust makes a payment, the beneficiaries are losing money that

14

they would otherwise get and are indirectly contributing to

15

that payment.

16

releasees:

17

we put in evidence that was uncontested from the lead director

18

of the trusts and from the protector of the trust who testified

19

that they could not in the exercise of their fiduciary duties

20

make these payments unless it was in the best interest of all

21

the beneficiaries.

22

the beneficiaries if all of the beneficiaries and all of the

23

trustees and protectors, as well as the trusts, receive those

24

releases.

THE COURT:

non-existent claims that can't be asserted by anyone and

5

MR. STPHAO:

Your Honor, from our perspective, many,

6

if not all of these claims, would ultimately not succeed, but

7

that doesn't mean they're not going to be made, and there are

8

allegations in the complaint that are much broader than just

9

the directors.

10

The Oregon complaint, for example, asserts that all of

11

the Sacklers were implicated in something they call the Sackler

12

Pharmaceutical Family Enterprise.

13

John Does numbers 9 through 100.

14

trustees' position on that was further confirmed by orders from

because the trusts are for the benefits of all descendants of

24

is by suing the trustees.

The California complaint has

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

214

1

MS. MONAGHAN:

That also covers the transferees,

2

right, because the transferees received distributions from

3

Purdue but they are released only in their capacity as

4

transferees and only to the extent of the amount of the

5

transfer.

6

Then there are what are called the IACs, the

7

independent associated companies.

8

companies under the express terms of the settlement have to be

9

sold, and the net proceeds go into the estate.

10

The independent associated

So there's

clearly a conceivable effect on the estate there.

11

And the protector, a woman named Alexa Saunders,

12

testified without demur that she couldn't authorize the sales

of the IACs without getting releases for the IACs.

14

fact, she doubted they would be saleable without those

15

releases.

16

And, in

The last category is advisors and employees of the

17

foregoing, but they are released only in that capacity.

18

definition of the release makes it clear that capacity

19

limitation, and that's really to avoid opening a back door

20

because if you could sue -- if you couldn't sue, you know, the

21

trust company but you could sue the employee, the release

22

wouldn't really be effective, but it's only if you are suing

23

the employee in their capacity as an employee of that trust

24

company.

25

the

So I think that those five categories are clearly
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

215
LBUQpur6
1

justified and are clearly necessary to give effect to the

2

release, both to provide peace that is necessary because of the

3

intertwining of Purdue and the Sacklers and to ensure that

4

payments are made.

5

In addition to the obligors under the settlement,

6

there is a very complex web of credit support agreements that

7

pull in all of these parties one way or another.

8

creditors also wanted something called a further assurances

9

agreement pursuant to which they would all agree that they

And then The

10

wouldn't make any transfers that would defeat their ability to

11

fund these payments, and so they are all one way or another

12

involved in ensuring that these payments are made.

13

really required a huge effort to bring all of these

14

individuals, all of these trusts all together because this is

15

an enormous commit.

16

And it

The assets of the four former defendants are less than

17

20 years of side A's commitment to the settlement, and one of

18

my clients testified at the hearing it's the finality provided

19

by the settlement that enables them to make this commitment,

20

but they really had to come together as a group to commit to a

21

settlement of this enormity.

22

THE COURT:

And none of that would have been necessary

23

if they had in the ten years preceding the Sacklers withdrawal

24

from active involvement in Purdue, followed their historic

25

practice of paying the taxes, taking out ten percent in

(212) 805-0300

216

dividends, and leaving the rest of the money that was earned by

2

Purdue with the debtors, which, if I calculate it correctly,

3

would have funded this plan and a little more.

THE COURT:

I have no quarrel with

the payment of taxes duly assessed and justly owed.
I asked maybe a week or ten days ago whether there was

15

anything in the record about the Sackler's historic pattern of

16

taking money out of the company.

17

that in the 12 years prior to the 2007 settlement, the Sacklers

took a billion three or a billion four out of the company,

19

90 percent of which was used to pay taxes, which is what

happens with a closely held corporation.

was not used to pay taxes.

less money.

And the reason for that was that Purdue had lost

restored, which was in, I believe, either late 2007 or early

14

2008, that the company started generating free cash in the

15

amounts that funded the amounts that you are talking about from

16

2008 to 2018.

17

THE COURT:

And where is that in the record?

18

MS. MONAGHAN:

I can't recall off the top of my head

where it is in the record, but it is definitely something that

we briefed below and referenced.

23

It's really not in dispute, I don't believe.

24
25

So we can find those

We can show you the dates of the patent decision.

THE COURT:

I have a long interest in knowing how much

money Purdue was making in those years.

What percentage of

219
LBUPPUR7

that money was getting taken out?

2

that, at a time when at least some of the people who were

3

running it were attuned to the fact that the family finances

4

might be jeopardized, took a lot of money out of the

5

corporation, an amount of money that even after the payment of

6

taxes and a 10 percent dividend, which would be a billion

7

dollars, an amount of money that if left in the corporation,

8

would have fully funded this plan with a half a billion dollars

left over, if my math is correct.

MS. MONAGHAN:

So I have an issue with the fact that over that

ten-year period, all that money, when Purdue suddenly had

patent protection again and was actively marketing its drug and

20

its other products, and Betadine was being used when I had

problems, all of a sudden there's no more money in the

I'm not interested in whether a fraudulent conveyance

I'm looking for whether there was abuse,

can be put on the facts of the ten years prior to the

We would be happy to submit a

11

One other point that's in the record that I think

12

might have been overlooked in this analysis is that from the

13

years from 2008 to 2018, this board included outside directors,

But there's a difficult statutory issue, and there's

an extremely difficult issue about whether there has been

abuse.

whether -- this is circumstantial evidence.

The issue is
I didn't expect

10

admissions.

The issue is whether the circumstantial evidence,

11

of which there is quite a bit in this record, admits of the

12

conclusion that beginning after the resolution of the first

13

round of litigation, the Sacklers began to take steps against

14

the possibility that things would go south again, as they did,

15

and whether you can draw from that conclusion that they did

16

what they did, managed to make their outside contribution,

17

which I sometimes think of as a contribution because sometimes

18

I'm thinking one way and sometimes I think of as a refund

19

because sometimes I'm thinking another way, made it necessary.

20

They made themselves necessary.

21

MS. MONAGHAN:

Your Honor, at the time -- so the first

22

of the cases that led to the filing of this bankruptcy, which

23

was really precipitated by cases by municipalities and States,

24

were filed in 2014, I believe, and there was less than half a

25

dozen.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

224
LBUPPUR7
1

They stopped taking any distributions at all in 2016.

2

And between that first filing and the filing of the Chapter 11

3

The

shareholders receive distributions when there are profits.

11

That doesn't have anything to do with abuse of the bankruptcy

system, and particularly not when the last of those

distributions is three years before the filing.

I just don't see how that's even circumstantial

evidence, and it's certainly not evidence that was relied upon

findings.

On all three of those dimensions, Judge Drain put

The issue that you're raising about whether there was

some overall abuse of the bankruptcy system would be based on

nothing but speculation.

Well, I'm not basing it on speculation.

I've got a list yea long in my chambers of all the record cites

it's an issue that has come to concern me greatly.

to figure out -- I'm wrestling with it, and I'm trying to

12

figure out whether I need to remand to the bankruptcy court for

further findings, whether I'm supposed to make those findings

in a case where I really do think the bankruptcy court had

I'm trying

I would also point out, your Honor,

that this settlement comes with, as many of the Appellees who

That all has nothing to do with what's

That doesn't happen a lot in the

MS. MONAGHAN:

Judge Drain was, obviously, subjected

to incredible pressures by this case, as everybody has been.

10

But I would also say that he made very clear findings, and

11

those findings were that the contribution was substantial, that

12

there were substantial litigation risks.

13

And on that front, I would point out that there was a

14

single case that actually went through an evidentiary phase,

15

and my client was dismissed out of it on an extraordinary writ

16

from the Utah courts.

17

assumption that there should be a greater contribution has to

18

be measured in terms of the legal risk.

19

settlements are about, right, balancing benefits against risks.

20

And so in that case, the basis for the

That's what

You're pointing to a reason that you think maybe the

21

settlement could have been higher, but Judge Drain, in addition

22

to the cri de coeur that you referred to, made specific

23

findings that the settlement was warranted because there was

24

substantial litigation risk on both sides, including on the

25

plaintiff's side, and that was supported not only by our

THE COURT:

Well, that's on one theory.

That's on a

public nuisance theory.

verdict in favor of the plaintiff's and against CVS and

7

nuisance, it's a very interesting theory.

MS. MONAGHAN:

Then there was a public nuisance

Public

Well, I think the answer, though, is

settlements are based on that balance of risk, on that balance

10

of litigation risk, and there are items that can go in both

11

columns on both sides.

12

And the court in this case found that this settlement

13

was appropriate and should be confirmed, in light of all of

14

those factors.

15

well aware of, about the amount of distribution, and say that's

16

the sole factor or that that somehow overrides all other

17

factors is not consistent with the Second Circuit's law, and

18

it's not consistent with what Judge Drain did here.

19

aware of the amounts of the distributions, everyone was.

20

And so to take a factor, which the Court was

I'm not even sure that the facts

I don't know.

MS. MONAGHAN:

I haven't found them.

I don't see how you can overturn a

confirmation on the basis that there was abuse, if there is no

2

evidence that anyone was manipulating the bankruptcy process.
And I would ask for the opportunity, because this is a

3

significant allegation to be thrown at my client, to submit

4

something on that because it's not the case that that is

5

supported in any way in the record.

6

THE COURT:

Well, you're welcome to submit something.

7

Anyone is welcome to submit something, but as I said, I have a

8

list in my chambers of record cites that some folks from the

9

U.S. Attorney's Office could weave into -- and any competent

10

litigator, and everybody in here is more than a competent

11

litigator, could weave into an argument that there was a

12

longstanding plan by the Sacklers to get as much money out of

13

the company as it could in the years before they withdrew from

14

the lists and left Purdue with much less money than it had

15

earned, to fend for itself until such time as they elected to

16

give some money into the bankruptcy.

17

MS. MONAGHAN:

Your Honor, I think all of the

18

plaintiffs before and then after the creditors came into the

19

bankruptcy, went after all of those issues.

20

talked to counsel for the UCC or you talk to counsel for the

21

consenting States or the MSGE group, you would hear that

22

they've thoroughly reviewed all of those issues.

presentations on those issues to the mediators.

priced into the settlement, and that's what Judge Drain found.

MR. UZZI:

Your Honor, Gerard Uzzi of Milbank on

behalf of the Raymond Sackler family.
Just to address your last point, your Honor, I don't

9

believe you can look at this issue of whether there's an abuse

10

by this release by saying, well, did the Sacklers conspire to

11

keep -- strip money out of the company.

12

issue, right?

There's a fundamental issue of what's being

13

settled here.

That claim, as to the recovery of funds that the

14

Sacklers have taken out of the company, belongs to the estate.

15

It's not --

16

THE COURT:

Because that's the

But that's a fraudulent conveyance claim.

17

I'm not interested in the fraudulent conveyance claim.

18

Purdue wants to settle a fraudulent conveyance claim, it's

19

welcome to do so, but it's possible to draw more than one

20

inference from a set of facts.

21

If

I'm talking about something entirely separate from

22

whether, as a technical, legal matter that money could be

23

clawed back under a fraudulent conveyance claim.

24
25

MR. UZZI:

Understood, your Honor, but I do think

those issues are related, and the facts that you are pointing
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300

230
LBUPPUR7
1

to are just simply allegations and, we would submit, are facts

2

that are taken out of context, but that ignores the rest of the

3

record, your Honor.

4

And I know the time is short, so in our brief

5

submitted in the bankruptcy case, I point you to page 19 of 57

6

that goes through the counter-factual record in detail, in

7

detail, as to what the board was thinking at the time that the

8

distributions were made, and why all of those distributions

9

were proper at the time that they were made.

10

And you just can't look -- you know, I submit, your

11

Honor, you can't look out of context at some allegations that

12

were made, snippets taken out of context, and say, is there an

13

abuse of the release here, when there is a counter-factual

14

record, your Honor.

15

And the fundamental issue that you're asking is really

16

going to what's being released in the first place and, you

17

know, because it assumes -- your Honor's abuse analysis --

MR. UZZI:

Nobody else is

Everybody else, sit down.

Your Honor's abuse analysis kind of almost

21

assumes the correctness of what's otherwise being settled here,

22

where Judge Drain did find that there were substantial defenses

23

to all the allegations that were made, and that includes this

24

allegation, your Honor, that the Sacklers engaged in some sort

25

of conspiracy to strip assets out of the company.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

231
LBUPPUR7
1

That's the reason why we have settlements, your Honor,

2

because that issue was in dispute, and we can't assume the

3

correctness of the issue in dispute to bootstrap what is an

4

abusive -- an argument of an abusive of the release.

5

We have the creditors here, who have analyzed that

6

issue in detail, and your Honor, the reason why we did not

7

stand up during the primary argument is because this is, in

8

fact, the creditors' plan.

9

10

And we were reserving time if you

your Honor, so we can address it.

11

But the creditors here have determined that issue,

your Honor, the issue of whether there was a -- again, I'll use

13

the term conspiracy to strip assets out of the company.

14

They've looked at that issue.

15

context of looking at the actual merits of that, have decided

16

that this settlement is appropriate.

17

They've analyzed it, and in the

So I don't believe you can, on the one hand, say,

18

well, there's a merits argument there and the merits argument

19

is properly settled because the record shows that and says

20

that's fair, but say just in case they were wrong, it's an

21

abuse of the release?

22

Honor.

I can't reconcile that tension, your

23

I think those have to be looked at together.

24

yes, there are allegations on one hand, but there are

25

allegations on the other side, your Honor, too, that we

And,

232
LBUPPUR7
1

submit -- again, I invite you your Honor to look specifically

2

at pages 19 and 57 of our brief that goes through this in

3

detail and not just an out-of-context snippet of, you know,

4

David Sackler saying, when he was not even on the board and

5

barely out of college, you know, gee, will people come after us

6

in the future?

7

look to the fact that the company, through most of the time

8

that these distributions were taken out, were under the

9

supervision of a corporate -- operating under a corporate

10

Which is what everybody wants to point to, and

integrity agreement and under the supervision of a monitor.

11

They got outside counsel from blue chip firms telling

12

them that they were in compliance with their responsibilities.

13

That's all in the record, your Honor.

14

So the record is there.

We can supplement the record.

15

We're happy to do that, your Honor, but the record is there.

16

The record is there on the underlying claim of whether there

17

was a conspiracy to strip assets and the creditors decided to

settle this.

questions for me.

you all are very tired.

I see no benefit in pulling my punches.

From the

3

beginning, I've told you I want you to know what's on my mind,

4

and I wasn't kidding.

5

To me, there are two issues in this case.

6

The statutory authorization is the other one.

7

And this is the thing that's on my mind.
That's one of them.

And by the way, one of my law clerks found another bit

8

of legislative history on Public Law 111, which says that the

9

committee that's proposing the law expresses no view on whether

10

there is any such authority, and we're authorizing this in the

11

case of asbestos so that Congress can decide whether to expand

it later, after we see how this works.
