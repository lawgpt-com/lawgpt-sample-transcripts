Assistant: Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.
Ross Geller: Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Assistant: Puerto Rican.
Ross Geller: Two, I think a two.
Assistant: You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
Ross Geller: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Assistant: Wow, you catch on quick.
Ross Geller: Well, I have a PhD, so...
Ross Geller: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Ross Geller: You sprayed my front twice!
Assistant: You've never turned?
Ross Geller: No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Assistant: Mississippi? I said count to five'!
Ross Geller: Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?
Assistant: Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.
Ross Geller: So, how dark is it gonna get?
Assistant: You got sprayed with two two' s and...
Ross Geller: I'm a four?
Assistant: Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
Ross Geller: Really!
Assistant: You might wanna get back in there.
Ross Geller: Ok!
Ross Geller: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
Assistant: You got two more twos?
Ross Geller: I'm an eight!
