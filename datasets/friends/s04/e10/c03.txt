Chandler Bing: I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Drew: I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Chandler Bing: See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Drew: Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Chandler Bing: Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Mike: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Chandler Bing: Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Mike: Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Drew: Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Mike: Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Drew: Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Chandler Bing: Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Mike: Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Chandler Bing: Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
