Ross Geller: That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Rachel Green: Yes!!
Chandler Bing: All right buddy, way to go!
Ross Geller: Dude, what are you doing?
Chandler Bing: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Chandler Bing: Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Monica Geller: I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.

Rachel Green: Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Monica Geller: Okay, can we please go eat?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. What are we getting?
Monica Geller: Anything but stew.
Ross Geller: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Chandler Bing: What if Joey were president?

Phoebe Buffay: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Rachel Green: Oh, ah with who?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Rachel Green: Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Phoebe Buffay: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Rachel Green: Oh! That's fine.
Phoebe Buffay: Great! Okay, good for you!
