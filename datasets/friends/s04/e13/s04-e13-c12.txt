Joey Tribbiani: Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Rachel Green: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Ross Geller: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Rachel Green: He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Monica Geller: Okay, it's ready. Come on.

Phoebe Buffay: Great!
Ross Geller: This is beautiful!

Phoebe Buffay: Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Monica Geller: Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know, it looks the same.
Monica Geller: You used to have carpet.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah!
Monica Geller: So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Ross Geller: Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Monica Geller: Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.

Ross Geller: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: How'd it go?
Chandler Bing: Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh good!
Chandler Bing: She is now.
Ross Geller: What are you saying?
Chandler Bing: I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Phoebe Buffay: How? How is your fault?
Chandler Bing: Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Rachel Green: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Ross Geller: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
