Chandler Bing: Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Phoebe Buffay: Now, have you told anyone else?
Chandler Bing: No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Phoebe Buffay: You told me.

Phoebe Buffay: Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Chandler Bing: Me too.
