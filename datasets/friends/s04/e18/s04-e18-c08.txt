Joshua Burgin: ...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Rachel Green: Wow! This place is fabulous!
Joshua Burgin: Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Rachel Green: Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Joshua Burgin: Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Rachel Green: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?

Joshua Burgin: Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Rachel Green: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Joshua Burgin: Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Rachel Green: Ah.

Mrs. Burgin: Oh, say no more!
Mr. Burgin: We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Joshua Burgin: Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Mr. Burgin: Yep, sucks!
