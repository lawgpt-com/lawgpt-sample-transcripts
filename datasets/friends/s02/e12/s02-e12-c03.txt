Joey Tribbiani: Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Chandler Bing: Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Chandler Bing: Hello.
Erica Ford: It's Erica.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah, the stalker.
Erica Ford: Never mind, it's open.
Chandler Bing: Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Joey Tribbiani: Let's get out of here.
Chandler Bing: The one time they're not home.
Joey Tribbiani: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Chandler Bing: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Joey Tribbiani: She's comin'.
Erica Ford: It's me.
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Chandler Bing: Wait, wait, wait.
Erica Ford: Hi.
Joey Tribbiani: Erica.
