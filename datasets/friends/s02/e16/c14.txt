Monica Geller: That's great.
Richard Burke: Very tasteful.
Phoebe Buffay: Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Monica Geller: Yes.
Rachel Green: What? You didn't get one.
Phoebe Buffay: OK, well then what is this?
Richard Burke: What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Phoebe Buffay: OK, that's my tattoo.
Rachel Green: That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
Phoebe Buffay: OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Rachel Green: Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Ross Geller: You got a tattoo?
Rachel Green: Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Ross Geller: Lemme see.
Rachel Green: Well?
Ross Geller: Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Rachel Green: Really?
Ross Geller: Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Rachel Green: I guess.
Ross Geller: Hey, save us some pizza.
