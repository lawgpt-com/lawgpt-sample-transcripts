Phoebe Buffay: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Chandler Bing: What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, my.
Chandler Bing: What?
Phoebe Buffay: She wants to meet you in person.
Chandler Bing: Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Phoebe Buffay: What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Chandler Bing: Okay, I'll do it!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
