Richard Burke: Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
Monica Geller: This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Richard Burke: You're strict.
Monica Geller: It's for their own good.
Richard Burke: You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Monica Geller: Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Richard Burke: If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Monica Geller: Very good.
Richard Burke: Thank you.
Monica Geller: You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Richard Burke: You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Monica Geller: I'm gonna set them to my time.
Richard Burke: Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
Monica Geller: No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Richard Burke: Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
Monica Geller: No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Richard Burke: No come on. Come on tell me.
Monica Geller: No. See you don't understand.
Richard Burke: Come on.
Monica Geller: No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Richard Burke: No that's not true. That is not true.
Monica Geller: Oh yeah.
Richard Burke: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Richard Burke: Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
Monica Geller: What if they get mixed up?
Richard Burke: Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Monica Geller: You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Richard Burke: See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
