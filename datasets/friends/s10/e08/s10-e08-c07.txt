Joey Tribbiani: How late are we?
Ross Geller: Forty-five minutes.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow.
Ross Geller: Here!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
Ross Geller: You may want to lose the foam finger!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh!
Joey Tribbiani: You are not at Thanksgiving?
Rachel Green: No...
Phoebe Buffay: No, we're late!
Rachel Green: What are you doing here!
Ross Geller: We're late too!
Joey Tribbiani: We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time.
Phoebe Buffay: Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Ross Geller: So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, where were you!
Ross Geller: Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Phoebe Buffay: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Rachel Green: And I won!
Ross Geller: You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Rachel Green: Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
Ross Geller: Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Rachel Green: Yeah. That's me!
Ross Geller: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Phoebe Buffay: And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Joey Tribbiani: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Ross Geller: I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Rachel Green: She won a thousand dollars!
Ross Geller: So this is an annual thing?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Phoebe Buffay: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Ross Geller: Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Rachel Green: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Joey Tribbiani: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Phoebe Buffay: Alright, what are we gonna say?
Ross Geller: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
Joey Tribbiani: No. Here.
Ross Geller: HEY!
