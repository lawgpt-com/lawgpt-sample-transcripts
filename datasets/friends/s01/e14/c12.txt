Ross Geller: So, um, what do you do for a living?
Kristin: Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Carol Willick: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Susan Bunch: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Ross Geller: Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Kristin: I guess.
Ross Geller: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Carol Willick: Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Ross Geller: Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
