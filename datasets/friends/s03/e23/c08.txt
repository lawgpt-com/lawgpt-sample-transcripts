Rachel Green: Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Monica Geller: Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Chandler Bing: Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Monica Geller: Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Ross Geller: Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.

Phoebe Buffay: All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Chandler Bing: Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
#ALL#: Good luck!
