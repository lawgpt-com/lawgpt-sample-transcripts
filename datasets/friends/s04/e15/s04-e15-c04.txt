Chandler Bing: Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Janice Litman Goralnik: I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Chandler Bing: Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Chandler Bing: I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Chandler Bing: No! No! Not, Paris.
