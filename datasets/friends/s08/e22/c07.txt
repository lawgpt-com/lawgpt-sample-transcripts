Rachel Green: Ross.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Can I ask you something?
Ross Geller: Uh-huh.
Rachel Green: When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
Ross Geller: Mmm?
Rachel Green: ...were you this irritating?
Ross Geller: Wow!
Rachel Green: Excuse me?!
Ross Geller: Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
Rachel Green: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Ross Geller: Y'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
Rachel Green: Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
Ross Geller: Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!

Rachel Green: Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Ross Geller: Oh, you're nice to her.
Rachel Green: She has the drugs!
Dr. Long: We'll do a quick check.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Dr. Long: So, eight days late huh?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Dr. Long: You must be a little uncomfortable.
Rachel Green: Eh, just a tad.
Dr. Long: You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Ross Geller: Do them!!
Dr. Long: Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.
Rachel Green: Well, we are ready to try anything.
Dr. Long: Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Dr. Long: You can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods...
Rachel Green: Great! We will do all of those.
Dr. Long: ...taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.
