Lewis: Professor Geller?
Ross Geller: Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Lewis: I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
Ross Geller: And why exactly would I do that?
Lewis: Because I'm in love with you.
Ross Geller: What?!
Lewis: Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
Ross Geller: No!
Lewis: Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Ross Geller: Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Lewis: No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
Ross Geller: What?
Lewis: He's got a girlfriend!
Ross Geller: I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Lewis: I know! It's awful. I love you.
