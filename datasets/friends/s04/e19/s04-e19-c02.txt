Ross Geller: Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Emily Waltham: He does that?!
Ross Geller: Uh, I don't know, whatever.
Emily Waltham: I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Ross Geller: Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Emily Waltham: I love both of you!
Ross Geller: Yeah?

Emily Waltham: I wish I didn't have to go.
Ross Geller: Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Emily Waltham: Ohh, Ross, please!
Ross Geller: One more day, seriously/
Emily Waltham: Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Ross Geller: So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Emily Waltham: I wish I could.
Ross Geller: Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
Emily Waltham: I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Emily Waltham: You didn't!
Ross Geller: No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
