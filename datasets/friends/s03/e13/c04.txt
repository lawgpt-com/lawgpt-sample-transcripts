Rachel Green: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Rachel Green: Do you have any ice?
Joey Tribbiani: Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Rachel Green: Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Joey Tribbiani: I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Rachel Green: Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Rachel Green: But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Rachel Green: How often do you read it?
Joey Tribbiani: Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Rachel Green: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Joey Tribbiani: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Rachel Green: Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, you got it.
Rachel Green: All right.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
