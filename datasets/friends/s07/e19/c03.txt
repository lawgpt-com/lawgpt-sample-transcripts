Monica Geller: Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Monica Geller: That's what you say about porn.
Joey Tribbiani: You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Monica Geller: No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Joey Tribbiani: Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Monica Geller: Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
