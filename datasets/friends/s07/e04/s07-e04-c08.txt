Chandler Bing: Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Ross Geller: Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"

Ross Geller: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.

Chandler Bing: Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Ross Geller: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
