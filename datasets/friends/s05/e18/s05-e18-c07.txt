Ross Geller: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?

Carol Willick: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Joey Tribbiani: Who knows?
The Casting Director: Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Ross Geller: Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
The Casting Director: Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Joey Tribbiani: Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Ross Geller: Yeah, it is.
Kyle: Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Ross Geller: No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
