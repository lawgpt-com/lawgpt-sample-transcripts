Agency Guy: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Monica Geller: Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?

Monica Geller: Uh, we're gonna be great.
Chandler Bing: You're gonna be great.
Monica Geller: Well... obviously!
Agency Guy: Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Monica Geller: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Erica: Hi...
Chandler Bing: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Erica: Hi.
Agency Guy: I'll let you get acquainted.
Chandler Bing: Ok.
Erica: So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
Chandler Bing: That's what our friends call us.
Erica: Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
Monica Geller: I don't know about that.
