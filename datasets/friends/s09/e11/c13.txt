Phoebe Buffay: Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
Phoebe Buffay: Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
Joey Tribbiani: Nice.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Joey Tribbiani: No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
Phoebe Buffay: About what?
Joey Tribbiani: He slept with you and then never called you.
Phoebe Buffay: And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Director: Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
Man: So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
Director: Cut, cut! What are you doing!?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Extra: Me too!
Another Extra: Me too!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
