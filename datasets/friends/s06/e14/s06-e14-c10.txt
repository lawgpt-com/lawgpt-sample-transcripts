Ross Geller: Slides are almost ready.
Jill Green: Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Ross Geller: Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Jill Green: Oh great!
Ross Geller: Hello?
Rachel Green: What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Ross Geller: O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Rachel Green: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Ross Geller: So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Rachel Green: Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Ross Geller: Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Jill Green: So?
