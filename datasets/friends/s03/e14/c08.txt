Ross Geller: Oh, well...
Rachel Green: Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Ross Geller: Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Rachel Green: Because, he's my friend.
Ross Geller: Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Rachel Green: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Ross Geller: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Rachel Green: I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
