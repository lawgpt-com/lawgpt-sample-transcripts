Timothy Burke: Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Monica Geller: I was probably waiting for it to open.
Timothy Burke: I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Monica Geller: You look great too.
Timothy Burke: You're an excellent patient!
Monica Geller: So how does it look?
Timothy Burke: Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Monica Geller: Like a pirate?!
Timothy Burke: If that helps you.
Monica Geller: Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Timothy Burke: I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Monica Geller: Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Timothy Burke: Uh.
Monica Geller: No way!
Timothy Burke: I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Monica Geller: Oh.
Timothy Burke: But we broke up.
Monica Geller: Oh.
Timothy Burke: She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Monica Geller: Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
Timothy Burke: You're not wearing the patch yet.
Monica Geller: I know.
