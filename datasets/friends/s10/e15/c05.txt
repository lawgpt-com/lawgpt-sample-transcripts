Rachel Green: Hi.
Ross Geller: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Rachel Green: Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Ross Geller: Ok.
Rachel Green: Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Ross Geller: Nooo!
Rachel Green: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Ross Geller: So, you're not going to Paris.
Rachel Green: No, I'm still going.
Ross Geller: Wh... wh...what?
Rachel Green: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
Ross Geller: Yeeeah!
