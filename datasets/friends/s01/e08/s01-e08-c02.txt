Rachel Green: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Chandler Bing: You did?

Monica Geller: I did.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Not me.
Ross Geller: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Chandler Bing: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?

Chandler Bing: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?

Chandler Bing: WHAT IS IT?!
Monica Geller: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
#ALL#: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Chandler Bing: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
