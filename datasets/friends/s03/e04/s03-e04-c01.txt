Host: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Mike: And there is Kevin.
Joey Tribbiani: Can we please turn this off?
Rachel Green: Noo way, Kevin.
Mike: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Ross Geller: Are you intrigued?
Chandler Bing: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Mike: Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
