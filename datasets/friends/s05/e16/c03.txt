Rachel Green: Uhh, we still need a tip.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Rachel Green: A couple of bucks.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Monica Geller: Wow!
Chandler Bing: Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you guys!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey Joey!
Monica Geller: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Monica Geller: Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Joey Tribbiani: Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Monica Geller: I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Monica Geller: Are you saying I smell bad?
Joey Tribbiani: No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Monica Geller: What's with him?
Chandler Bing: Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
