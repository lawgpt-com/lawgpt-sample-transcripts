Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Chandler Bing: Who was it?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Monica Geller: Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Chandler Bing: Sure!
Monica Geller: Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Chandler Bing: Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Monica Geller: No.
Chandler Bing: Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Monica Geller: Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Chandler Bing: So, that's it?
Monica Geller: I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Chandler Bing: Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Monica Geller: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Chandler Bing: I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Monica Geller: Are you mocking me?
Chandler Bing: No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
