Joey Tribbiani: Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Phoebe Buffay: I know. They were mine.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Phoebe Buffay: No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Joey Tribbiani: That's weird!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Joey Tribbiani: That's...kinda hot.
Phoebe Buffay: I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Phoebe Buffay: And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Phoebe Buffay: There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay whatever.
Joey Tribbiani: You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
