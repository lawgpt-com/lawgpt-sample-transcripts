Amy Green: Hey, your English is getting better!!
Ross Geller: Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Ross Geller: What... what you working on?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Ross Geller: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Joey Tribbiani: What did I just say?
Ross Geller: Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
