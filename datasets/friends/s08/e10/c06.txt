Dina: I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!

Joey Tribbiani: Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
Rachel Green: Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
Dina: Joe, mom and dad are fine...
Joey Tribbiani: Is that a sandwich?!
Rachel Green: Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
Dina: I'm pregnant.
Joey Tribbiani: What?!
Rachel Green: Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Joey Tribbiani: Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Dina: Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
Rachel Green: What?! Dina...
Joey Tribbiani: Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Dina: Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.
Joey Tribbiani: You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Dina: Why? Where are you going?
Joey Tribbiani: I can't look at you right now!
Dina: Wow.
Rachel Green: I know.
