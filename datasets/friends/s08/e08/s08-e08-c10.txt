Stu: So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
Monica Geller: Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
Stu: No problem. So who's the party for?
Monica Geller: My husband.
Stu: You hired your husband a hooker?
Monica Geller: She's a stripper.
Stu: No, she's a hooker.
Monica Geller: Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Stu: When they're hookers.
Monica Geller: Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Stu: Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
