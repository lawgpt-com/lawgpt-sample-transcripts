Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: What are you doing?
Chandler Bing: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Monica Geller: That's so sweet. Find anything?
Chandler Bing: Slim Pickings.
Monica Geller: Nothing, huh?
Chandler Bing: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Monica Geller: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Chandler Bing: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Monica Geller: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Chandler Bing: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Monica Geller: Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
