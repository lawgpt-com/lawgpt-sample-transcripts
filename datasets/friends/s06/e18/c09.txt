Elizabeth Stevens: Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Ross Geller: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Elizabeth Stevens: Who?
Ross Geller: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Elizabeth Stevens: Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Ross Geller: Umm, no. No.
Elizabeth Stevens: Yes you did! What was it?
Ross Geller: Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Elizabeth Stevens: Ohh that's so sweet!
Ross Geller: Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Burt: Dr. Geller!
Ross Geller: Burt!
