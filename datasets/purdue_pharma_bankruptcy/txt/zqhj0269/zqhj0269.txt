P R O C E E D I N G S

THE COURT:

Okay, good morning.

This is Judge

3

Drain.

4

the continued hearing on the Debtor’s request for

5

confirmation of their amended Chapter 11 plan.

6

off yesterday, there was some discussion about who would be

7

testifying today and the extent of that testimony.

8

received emails early this morning that I think clarified

9

that for Mr. Edmunds, but I’m happy to hear the parties on

10

We’re here in In Re Purdue Pharma L.P., et al. on

When we left

We

the record on it, too, which I think we should do.

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Hi, good morning, Your Honor.

12

This is -- let me just start us off.

13

Davis Polk for the Debtors.

14

email traffic is that today we’ll hear -- there’ll be live

15

testimony from Mortimer Sackler and Kathe Sackler.

16

believe that the parties have or are working on still a

17

resolution with respect to any remaining witnesses,

18

including additional Sacklers as well as the one witness,

19

Brian -- I forgot his last name -- who was going to maybe be

20

called by Maryland, but I think that’s being worked out as

21

well.

22

you will, will conclude today with Mortimer and Kathe

23

Sackler.

My understanding based on the

I

So, we’re hoping that the live witness testimony, if

24
25

Benjamin Kaminetzky of

One caveat, Your Honor, is that we’re still trying
to -- we’re still talking around the clock with the DMPs to

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 15

try to work that out.

2

permission, we’ve moved the possibility of recalling Mr.

3

Lowne, Mr. DelConte, Mr. Turner for the narrow purpose of

4

answering questions from the DMPs, again, with the -- with

5

the sincere hope that that will not occur.

6

What we’ve done is, with Your Honor’s

THE COURT:

Okay.

I had understood from Mr.

7

Edmunds’ email that he was not going to call Ilene Sackler

8

or Mr. Sheldon but maybe that’s changed in the interim.

9

MR. KAMINETZKY:

That’s my understanding as well,

10

that we’re going to conclude with Mortimer and Kathe and

11

that.

12

Edmunds?

But, you know, why don’t I just leave it to Mr.

13
14

MR. EDMUNDS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Thank you,

Mr. Kaminetzky.

15

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Before I do that, is that okay,

16

Your Honor, that -- to the extent we need to recall, you

17

know, just for the narrow purposes of the DMPs, we can do

18

that tomorrow?

19

Give us some time to hopefully --

THE COURT:

I guess so.

Although, as I understood

20

it, it was really -- their concern was really tied to what

21

you were seeking to have by way of findings in the

22

confirmation order.

23

this point.

24

hit the button by accident.

25

I hope it’s not expanded beyond that at

You’re on mute, Mr. Kaminetzky.

MR. KAMINETZKY:

212-267-6868

Yeah.

I think you

No, I don’t believe -- I

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

believe that’s the case.

2

we’re talking literally around the clock.

3

to make this go away.

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. EDMUNDS:

And, again, we really hope --

Okay.

So, we’re trying

Mr. Edmunds?

Yes, Your Honor.

So, what Mr.

6

Kaminetzky said is essentially right.

We will be calling

7

today for live testimony Mortimer Sackler and Kathe Sackler.

8

We have reached with Ilene Sackler through her counsel an

9

agreement in principle where we have, I think, filled in

10

enough of the details to say we are not going to call her.

11

We are going to provide a deposition and some documents as a

12

substitute for her live testimony.

13

to hammer that out, which I expect us to do after the live

14

witnesses today.

15

And we just need to --

With respect to Mr. Sheldon, both sides of the

16

Sackler Families and Debtors have agreed that we will

17

withdraw his declaration but that his documents will come

18

in.

19

objections to admission of the documents, and the documents

20

will come in except with respect to certain deposition

21

testimony related to members of the Sackler Family that will

22

come in except not for purposes of its truth, as with other

23

rulings the Court has made in this matter.

And they’ve withdrawn -- I think it was Debtor’s

24
25

So, I think that we’re set on that and I think
that we’ll need to work out some paper stipulation of filing

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 17
1

that withdraws the declaration and indicates what the

2

documents are in its place.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right, very well, thank

4

you.

So, I think then, if I have the order right, you want

5

to proceed first with Mortimer Sackler?

6

WOMAN:

7

MR. EDMUNDS:

8

THE COURT:

9
10

Correct, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.
Okay, all right.

anything more that you want to say in response, or Ms.
Steege?

To what Mr. Kaminetzky said.

11

(Overlapping)

12

MR. GLEIT:

13

Mr. Gleit, is there

Oh, I’ll let Ms. Steege go first, Your

Honor.

14

MS. STEEGE:

Apologize.

Your Honor, Catherine --

15

for the record, Catherine Steege on behalf of McKesson and

16

speaking on behalf of our larger DMP group.

17

very hard.

18

we’re very close.

19

I mean, we have objected to confirmation of the plan.

20

suppose our objections could be resolved by narrowing

21

certain releases and providing certain consideration to us

22

under the plan, and in that sense, could be viewed as

23

objections to what the order is.

24

that we have objected to the plan.

25

We hope we will reach an agreement.

I think

But I did want to just correct one thing.

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

We are working

Oh, I know.

I

But I did want to clarify

I know you have.

You resigned in early 2019?

That’s correct.

And you were a member of the board at the time?

I was a board member, yes.

And at all times when you were a member of the board,

you participated in the board’s meetings regularly, did you

not?

Regularly.

I’m sure I missed some, but yes.

And you read the board reports that were

number of independent outside directors on the board as

You know, so --

516-608-2400

Page 30

Q

Okay, so thinking about those companies, do you have an

2

understanding of whether the distributions made to members

3

of the Sackler Families were greater than the distributions

4

of capital made by those companies to their shareholders’

5

shareholders?

6

A

7

of time, I don’t think they were.

8

buy back their shares all the time as a means of

9

distributing funds to their shareholders.

I think if you look over a long enough average period
Because public companies

They pay

10

dividends as well.

And one thing to keep in mind is these

11

dividends and these distributions were all done from excess

12

cash that Purdue did not require.

13

the board in making those decisions of distributions,

14

including the outside directors who voted on them -- who

15

were voting on distributing excess cash that was not

required in the business.

17

Q

18

among members of the board as to whether, in fact, that was

19

-- your opinion was, in fact, correct?

20

A

21

proper level of distributions and the proper level of

22

diversifications.

23

wanted to diversify our assets more outside the

24

pharmaceutical business than the B side of the family, who

25

wanted to keep more and reinvest more in the pharmaceutical

debates about that between the sides.

those among the B side family, communicate to you that they

believed that the distributions being made by the company

were in excess of those that similar pharmaceutical

7

corporations were making to shareholders?

A

9

discussions and back and forths on that fact.

And did members of the board of directors, particularly

I don’t recall specifically.

I mean, we had a lot of
You know, my

10

view was we were a privately owned company, the business had

11

excess cash that it didn’t require, and so there was

12

discussion about what to do with that excess cash.

13

keep it and reinvest it even more heavily within the

14

pharmaceutical business in Purdue, or do you distribute it

15

out for the shareholders to invest in other work -- in other

16

businesses?

to invest in other businesses, you would be taking the money

from Purdue and then using it to expand those other

is that they wanted to keep more excess cash in the business

really help people and relieve pain, was getting diverted

and abused by others and causing pain.

became a balancing focus on the board where we were trying

to do everything and -- you know, asking management in the

MS. MONAGHAN:

The paragraph that begins,

"Beginning in or about May of 2007"?

MR. EDMUNDS:

That's correct.

It says that "Purdue knowingly and intentionally

A

5

that occurred prior to 2001.

of that platform; is that right?

8

A

I believe so.

9

Q

Okay.

And in fact, the allegations underlying that

count were that Purdue used that platform to try to expand

abusing opioids moving from OxyContin what were easier to

pharmacists, and other actors?

22

A

23

that the decline in OxyContin had several factors associated

24

with it, one of which was that abusers were shifting to

25

other products.

Do you recall whether Board members and Purdue

Do you remember that?

Yeah, I -- I recall management reporting to the Board

And that, for us, was, like, great news

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 63

because that was the purpose of the reformulation of

2

OxyContin, was to make it harder to abuse and, you know, we

3

never wanted people who didn't have a legitimate need for

4

the product to ever be using it.

5

And so the -- to the factor -- some portion, and

6

management could never pinpoint the -- what portion, but

7

that some portion of the decline was due to that, would --

8

was welcome news and was good news.

9

they said was the market dynamics, yes, was the change, was

And the other part that

10

that -- as I referred earlier, the prescription opioid

11

market as a whole started declining quite rapidly.

reported were contributing to the decline in OxyContin.

that Purdue had received the FDA approval to change the

label to the reformulated OxyContin with the abuse deterrent

properties for the first time on the label.

Like I said, you know, Region 0 was a Management

presentations to the Board on Region 0.

So at that time then -- first what is Region 0?

good news is the doctors we put in Region 0 that we feel

12

higher because those doctors were prescribing significant

amounts of OxyContin, were they not?

A

And we did not want that, correct.

15

Q

But that's what was happening right?

16

A

There were doctors that were acting inappropriately and

17

Management, to the best of their ability, tried to as they

18

could identify them and not call on them, not promote them,

19

not include them in incentive compensation plans.

20

because we -- as I said all along, the Board had a very

21

clear dual focus here.

available for physicians to legitimately prescribe to

23

patients who need it while at the same time minimizing the

24

abuse diversion and harm that could be caused if they were

25

used by others who did not require it medically.

things that had never been done before in the country or in

the world including the first ever abuse deterrent opioid

that the company did to try to deal with that problem, to

really try to get that balance between how do you make this

time, it is a fact, is it not, that Purdue pleaded guilty to

three counts, one of which included that Purdue was putting

Novel.

you are aware that Purdue Pharma settled with the state of

Oklahoma.

I am.

And you're aware that Purdue Pharma paid $200 million

Yeah.

Q

Well -- and $75 million was paid by the Sackler

families.

A

That's correct.

Q

Do you make a habit of paying $75 million to settle

novel legal claims?

Novel legal theories.

I thought it was more than that but, yes.

We

could fight those lawsuits for years and years and probably

reach a settlement and get those monies to the communities

and the individuals out there who are suffering.

for our family, is an easy choice to make.

one of the key goals in this settlement was to ensure the

And that,

And so, you

11

and individuals who are suffering, and so we're here

And it's approved for use in children as young as six

I don't recall the specifics of that but it's possible.

Q

Adhansia carries a black box warning that it contains

the high potential for abuse and dependence.

of that?

9

I believe so, yes.

10

Q

And you understand the releases that you're seeking in

that ties in with the period of time that I was on the board

of Purdue.

And so, you know, we're here trying

10

to get the settlement done so then we can get these vast

11

sums to these communities and to these people to help them,

12

rather than, you know, spend it on litigation forever.

13

Q

14

the Sackler families intend to sell off their IACs or

to be very clear.

Mr. Ozment filed a less than three page

8

objection, which centers entirely on the notice to

10

with respect to incarcerated persons.

11

cites no case law, and that's all it does.

witness after witness about their philosophical views on

public health issues, candidly, I'm not sure why I care what

Good afternoon.

2

Q

I assume you remember, Mr. Sackler, that various people

3

asked you about distributions out of the company, while you

4

were on the Board?

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

Are you are aware of the existence of a report by the

7

Special Committed of the Board of Directors, 356 pages long,

8

detailing all cash transfers out of Purdue for the benefit

9

or to shareholders from 2008 to 2019?

10

A

Yes, I am.

11

Q

Are you aware that that report concludes that $10.4

12

Billion was transferred out to or for the benefit of the

13

Sacklers during that time period?

14

A

Yes. Including the (indiscernible) transfers.

15

Q

Do you have any reason to believe that that report is

16

inaccurate in any material respect?

17

A

I do not.

18

Q

Are you aware of the existence of a Special -- of a

19

second report of a Special Committee of 401 pages, I'm not

20

asking you to verify the page number, obviously, also filed

21

on the public docket listing all intra-company and non-cash

22

transfers from Purdue to or for the benefit of the

23

shareholders, including IEC's during this same time period?

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

Are you aware that the debtors, special committee

the Board at the end of 2018, I think technically, your

15

letter was dated, January 6th, 2019, but there were no Board

16

meetings during the first two weeks of 2019, so do we

17

effectively agree that you were off the Board at the end of

18

2018?

19

A

Yes.

20

Q

And were you the last Sackler relative to leave the

21

Board (indiscernible) Purdue?

A

I was, by a matter of weeks, I believe.

Q

Since your departure, Mr. Sackler, have you, or to your

role at the debtors or to control or influence them?

3

Q

Mr. Sackler, are you aware that this Court directed the

4

appointment of an examiner, which was then appointed by the

5

Department of Justice to investigate independence in the

6

Special Committee from the Sackler family?

7

A

I am.

8

Q

Have you read the examiner's report?

9

A

I don't recall if I've read it or not.

I -- I heard

10

the conclusion, but I can't recall if I've read the whole

11

report.

12

Q

And how would you describe the conclusion, Mr. Sackler?

A

My understanding is that the examiner found no

interference on behalf of the family members with the

special committee.

Q

leads you to believe that the examiner missed something, and

18

do you know something that we should know that would make

his conclusions incorrect?

8

I think because there was -- I think because the company was

under such tremendous attack of litigation cases and if it -

I think because the company -- that's a good question.

10

- if ceasing marketing could, in any way, contribute to

11

reducing any incidence of suffering or loss of life or if it

12

had any -- could possibly have any positive effect, I think

13

it was important for the company to do that, to

15

And also, because doctors were under -- as long as the

16

product was still available to doctors to prescribe to

17

patients who need the medicine, I think that it was a good

decision.

19

I guess because of what was happening with the litigation

and the company and it seemed like the right thing to do at

I have heard that.

I agree.

stipulation reached by both sides of the family and Debtors

this morning I did not mention what the joint exhibit

MR. EDMUNDS:

that there are some deposition transcripts within this that

arguments that you have, obviously.
