Chandler Bing: Well, I feel like a snack!
Monica Geller: Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Chandler Bing: Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Ross Geller: What?!
Chandler Bing: Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Ross Geller: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Monica Geller: No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Ross Geller: Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Monica Geller: You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Ross Geller: How did you know about that?!
Chandler Bing: We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Ross Geller: Were you the ones called the cops?!
Chandler Bing: That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Ross Geller: Why not?
Chandler Bing: Because we hate them.
Ross Geller: Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Chandler Bing: We have heard you play.
Ross Geller: No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
