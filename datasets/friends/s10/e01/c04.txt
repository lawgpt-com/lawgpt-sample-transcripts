Phoebe Buffay: Hi, Mike's place.
Mike Hannigan: Hey, it's Mike.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, that was fast.
Mike Hannigan: Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
Mike Hannigan: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Phoebe Buffay: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Mike Hannigan: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
Precious: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
Phoebe Buffay: I... I'm Phoebe.
Precious: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
Phoebe Buffay: Enchante.
