Phoebe Buffay: Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Trudie Styler: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Trudie Styler: I'm Trudie.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh.
Trudie Styler: You must be Ben's mum.
Phoebe Buffay: Why else would I be here?
Trudie Styler: Do sit down.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh.
Trudie Styler: I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Trudie Styler: I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
Trudie Styler: Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
Trudie Styler: Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
Phoebe Buffay: Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
Trudie Styler: So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Phoebe Buffay: Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
Trudie Styler: Are you here for tickets?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Trudie Styler: I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
Trudie Styler: Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
Phoebe Buffay: The Police? Here? A reunion?!
