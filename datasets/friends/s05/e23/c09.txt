Monica Geller: I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.

Monica Geller: Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Phoebe Buffay: Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
