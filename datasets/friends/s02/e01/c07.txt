Rachel Green: Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Monica Geller: Rachel, how did this happen?
Rachel Green: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Phoebe Buffay: Where?
Rachel Green: At his apartment. Is this juice?
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Rachel Green: Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Monica Geller: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Chandler Bing: People do stupid things when they're upset.
Monica Geller: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
#ALL#: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Paulo: Hey, hey Ross.
Ross Geller: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Paulo: I do Raquel.
Ross Geller: So, uh, he's back.
Rachel Green: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Ross Geller: No, not a problem.
Rachel Green: Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Chandler Bing: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Chandler Bing: Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Monica Geller: You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Monica Geller: I promise.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
