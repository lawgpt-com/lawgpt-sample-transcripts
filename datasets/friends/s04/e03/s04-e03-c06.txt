Phoebe Buffay: That's weird.
Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Your nails.
Monica Geller: Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Monica Geller: Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Judy Geller: Honey, don't bite your nails.
Monica Geller: Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Phoebe Buffay: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Judy Geller: I'm not freaking out.
Monica Geller: Then why are you laughing?
Judy Geller: It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
Monica Geller: What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Judy Geller: Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Monica Geller: Frozen lasagnas?
Judy Geller: Um-hmm.
Monica Geller: You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Judy Geller: No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Monica Geller: You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Judy Geller: Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Monica Geller: That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Phoebe Buffay: I don't get it.
Judy Geller: No, I have faith...
Monica Geller: No! You have lasagnas!
Oven: Ding!
Phoebe Buffay: Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
