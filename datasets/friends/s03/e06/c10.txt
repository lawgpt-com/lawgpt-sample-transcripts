Monica Geller: Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: Huh?
Monica Geller: Where's your bed?
Phoebe Buffay: It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Monica Geller: What are you talking about?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Monica Geller: Everybody knows!
Phoebe Buffay: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Monica Geller: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Monica Geller: What?!?!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Monica Geller: You can spill. In the sink.
Phoebe Buffay: Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Monica Geller: I love you, too.
Phoebe Buffay: Aww, good. What?
Monica Geller: What? I'm just said.
Phoebe Buffay: No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
