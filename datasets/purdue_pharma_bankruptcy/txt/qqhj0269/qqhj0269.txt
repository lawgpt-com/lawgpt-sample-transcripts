THE COURT:

Okay, good morning.

This is Judge

Drain.

11

is the second day of the hearing on the Debtor’s request for

12

confirmation of their amended Chapter 11 plan.

13

the order of witnesses that was submitted for today and I’m

14

happy to go down that order unless there are any initial

15

housekeeping or other statements.

We are here in In re Purdue Pharma LP et al.

MR. HUEBNER:

This

And I have

Good morning, Your Honor.

For the

17

record, Marshall Huebner of Davis Polk & Wardwell on behalf

18

of the Debtors.

Can I be heard and seen clearly?

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. HUEBNER:

Yes.
Terrific.

Your Honor, three quick

21

matters for me before I turn the virtual podium over to Mr.

So hopefully those

of yesterday.

11

THE COURT:

12

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay, great.
Number two, Your Honor, I did want

13

to take the opportunity -- I did not want to cut in

14

yesterday, but you asked Mr. Kaminetzky a question yesterday

15

at the very end, which I actually had about six calls last

16

night to confirm.

17

want to jump in until I confirmed it.

18

the Court the answer for what it is worth.

19

just a lawyer, but there is each TDP was actually done by

20

its own group and was done by experts in the field of that

21

category of TDP.

22
23

So I do want to give
Obviously I’m

So, for example --

THE COURT:

All right.

And since I have Ms.

Greenspan, I’ll ask her that question, which is fine.

24
25

I actually knew the answer but I didn’t

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay, yeah.

Again, I’m not sure she

was involved in drafting of each TDPs.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I think she looked

516-608-2400

Page 42

at them afterwards.

But let’s see how the day goes.

2

will be ready to discuss that.

3

multiple parties last night how their TDPs were done.

4

it was definitely absolutely not done by anybody’s

5

bankruptcy lawyers.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. HUEBNER:

But we

And in confirmed with
And

Okay.
The last item, Your Honor, is Mr.

8

Troop asked me to announce on the record this morning, which

9

we are certainly happy to do, a few days ago as part of an

10

agreement on several other matters, including removing

11

things in the plan that were proving just unworkable, that

12

were really, you know, arguably for the benefit only of the

13

states that they were willing to live without as well as the

14

Stewart and Timney stipulation which was negotiated by

15

various parties and then presented to the Debtors.

16

didn’t’ negotiate it, the AHC and the UCC and the NCSG

17

negotiated it and then brought it to us, and we were fine

18

with it.

We

19

The Debtors were asked to pay all of the fees of

20

the NCSG through the date of the end of the third round of

21

mediation before Judge Chapman, where that group obviously

22

split with now approximately two-thirds of that group

23

constituting the 38 states out of 48 who support the plan.

24

Candidly, not an entirely simple proposition for us since

25

obviously most of the plan objectors are actually the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 43
1

remaining stub of that group that continues to object.

2

it's not typical to say the least to pay the fees for most

3

of the case for people who are very much not on board.

4

And

Nonetheless, we decided it was just the right

5

thing to do.

6

that will look a lot like the motions that the Court has

7

seen before with the MSGE and the AHC.

8

essentially be paying the fees in the face of the NCSG

through the end of round three of mediation for all of the

12

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah, sorry.

Could the witness in

13

Washington please stay on mute until we’re ready?

14

so much.

15

Thank you

So I just wanted to -- Mr. Troop just asked that

16

we let the Court know that.

17

formal motion on notice.

18

the AHC and the UCC and the MSGE all support the request,

19

and the Debtors ultimately came around to it.

20

we’re not paying for the fees of the objectors to object to

21

confirmation.

22

And, again, it just seems like the right thing to do, and so

23

we did it.

24
25

Again, there will be a full

Anyone can say their piece.

But

Obviously

This is through round three of mediation.

So, Your Honor, that -THE COURT:

Okay.

Just to be clear, those fees

aren’t being paid until there is a determination on that

motion.

MR. HUEBNER:

probably wasn’t clear.

4

notice to be a separate hearing with a proposed order

5

exactly as we do for everything in this case.

6

asked that it be announced this morning just to let the

7

world I guess know that the Debtors have agreed to do this.

8

And we didn’t have a reason to not exceed to his request.

9

THE COURT:

10

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That

We are filing a full motion on

Okay, fine.

MR. HUEBNER:

But Mr. Troop

Thank you.

So with that, Your Honor, I will go

11

off-camera and on mute and turn the podium over to

12

Kaminetzky and our witnesses for today.

13

THE COURT:

Okay, very well.

14

MR. ROTHSTEIN:

Your Honor, this is Paul Rothstein

15

for Dr. Masiowski.

I just have one really minor

16

housekeeping matter.

17

bring it up now or at the end of the day in regards to

18

Christina Pullo of Prime Clerk.

I don’t know whether you want me to

19

THE COURT:

Why don’t you go ahead?

20

MR. ROTHSTEIN:

Okay.

So I just would like to be

21

able to know what the Court said they were going to defer

22

ruling as to whether the information we requested yesterday

23

regarding the people in the hospital trust that voted no as

24

to whether we can get the granular data on that --

25

THE COURT:

No, that should come up when I hear

your argument on this issue.

2

into any issue before me.

this point.

4

MR. ROTHSTEIN:

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. KAMINETZKY:

7

So it is premature to raise it at

All right, thank you.

Okay.
Good morning, Your Honor.

Benjamin Kaminetzky of Davis Polk for the Debtors.

8
9

I’m not even sure how it ties

Before we turn to the first witness who is teed
up, Ms. Deborah Greenspan, I want to just provide an update

10

with respect to two other witnesses, Jesse DelConte and

11

Lianna Simmonds.

12

As Your Honor is aware, the insurer group filed a

13

motion in limine at Docket 3514 with respect to certain

14

testimony, very limited, offered by Jesse DelConte and Ms.

15

Lianna Simmonds.

16

Insurers Group, including Travelers, are engaged in good

17

faith negotiations with respect to that motion in limine.

18

So according, the insurer group agreed not to be crossing

19

Mr. DelConte or Ms. Simmonds today on the issues covered by

20

that motion in limine.

21

The Debtors, the Ad Hoc Committee, and the

The Debtors will call Mr. DelConte and Ms.

22

Simmonds back to the extent that motion in limine is not

23

worked out.

24

could and should and will be worked out.

25

Obviously we have -- you know, we believe it

So Mr. DelConte’s declaration will be offered into

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 46
1

evidence and hopefully received into evidence today, will be

2

subject to the issues raised in the insurer’s motion in

3

limine, at least until the parties’ efforts conclude.

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

5

MR. KAMINETZKY:

The debtors won’t be calling,

6

therefore, Ms. Simmonds today as Your Honor may have seen.

7

The only issue relates to the insurance, so she likely --

8

you know, we’ll just wait until the motion in limine is

9

worked out and --

10
11

THE COURT:

And she was not a witness other than

to introduce documents.

She didn’t offer up any testimony.

12

MR. KAMINETZKY:

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Exactly.

So that’s fine.
Okay, that’s fine.

Also, we have

15

confirmed again with the DMPs with whom we are still working

16

away at a resolution.

17

They’ll forego cross-examination on Mr. DelConte and Mr.

18

Turner.

19

back.

20

rather than, you know, make them do their spiel when

21

hopefully it won’t be necessary.

So we have the same agreement.

And if things fall apart, we’ll agree to bring them
I think that’s the most efficient way to proceed,

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. KAMINETZKY:

24

Okay.
So we’ve confirmed with

(indiscernible) and she is on board with that.

25

Finally, Your Honor, as you mentioned, we had to

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 47
1

shift around the order of witnesses.

2

witnesses.

We’ll proceed in the order that we provided to

3

the Court.

And then, you know, we’ll proceed with the

4

witnesses per my email to the Court and to the parties

5

yesterday evening.

6

that folks know what’s to come, or we could just proceed?

7
8

THE COURT:

Do you want me to read that order so

Well, was this order -- the order of

witnesses filed?

9

MR. KAMINETZKY:

10

we circulated last night.

11

THE COURT:

12

MR. KAMINETZKY:

13

Not the Debtor’s

It’s the order of witnesses that

Was it filed on the docket?
It was not filed -- its original

order was not filed on the docket.

14

THE COURT:

All right.

So I’ll just read it.

As

15

I have it, it’s Ms. Greenspan and Mr. DelConte, who are the

16

Debtor’s witnesses.

17

witness.

18

Simmonds, I guess.

Mr. Turner, who is also a Debtor

You are not going to actually go ahead with Ms.

19

MR. KAMINETZKY:

20

THE COURT:

Right.

And then John -- I hope I’m

21

pronouncing this right -- Guard, Jessica Horewitz, Gary

22

Gotto, and Peter Weinberger, each of whom are being offered

23

by the Ad Hoc Committee.

THE COURT:

Okay.

17

MR. KAMINETZKY:

I’m fine either way.

But I think

18

the U.S. Trustee can certainly ask those questions today,

19

because that’s not going to be -- his issue won’t be

20

resolved by the motion in limine.

21

THE COURT:

All right.

And frankly, I don’t think

22

the motion in limine really addresses those issues if I

23

understand them correctly, Mr. Higgins.

24

on asking those today.

25

MR. HIGGINS:

212-267-6868

So you should plan

516-608-2400

Page 49
1

THE COURT:

Okay.

2

MR. KAMINETZKY:

All right.
And just one final thing, Your

3

Honor, is that Mr. (indiscernible) from your office just

4

asked me to announce that one of the issues yesterday is

5

that folks shouldn’t click on the Zoom link, but instead

6

joined with browser and manually enter the password, and

7

that should overcome some of the problems that we had

8

yesterday.

9

So I thought I would do that (indiscernible).
THE COURT:

Okay.

And could I just say if someone

10

does have a problem linking in, they might shortcut being

11

able to link in by reaching out to Mr. (indiscernible) in

12

the clerk’s office and he can walk them through it.

13

hopefully that’s been done with people, as you said, last

14

night and this morning.

Okay.

15

So are we ready to call Ms. Greenspan then?

16

MR. KAMINETZKY:

17

But

Yes, we are.

Thank you, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:

Okay.

MR. KAMINETZKY: (indiscernible) Davis Polk &

Sitting here today on August

expert report that you would wish to change?

12
13

MS. GREENSPAN:

No, Your Honor, I do not wish to

change anything.

14

THE COURT:

15

So does anyone object to the admission of Ms.

Thank you.

Greenspan’s declaration or expert report?

17

All right.

I will admit the declaration and

counsel this yesterday, did you have any role in negotiating

MS. GREENSPAN:

No.

I did not have any role in

6

THE COURT:

Okay.

And I just want to -- you don’t

declaration or your report, you can sign off.

you submitted an August 5, 2021 declaration attaching an

24

to be your direct testimony in this case as an expert on

liquidation analyses and related issues.

today on August 13th, is there anything that you wish to

attached to and incorporated in it?

MR. DELCONTE:

THE COURT:

Sitting here

No, there is not.

Okay.

Does anyone object

to the admission of either of these declarations?

And I’m

saying that with the caveat that we previously recognized

10

that two parties in the case, their rights are reserved if

potential objections to the declarations to call and cross

Q

Paragraph 11 of your declaration was to evaluate whether the

Debtor’s plan satisfies the best interests of creditors test

6

under Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code.

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

And just so we have a mutual understanding, you would

9

agree with me that that test requires the plan proponent to

Mr. DelConte, your assignment in this case according to

Is that correct?

10

establish that for those creditors that have not accepted

11

the plan, the recovery they will receive under the plan will

12

not be less than what they would receive in a Chapter 7 case

of the Debtors, correct?

14

A

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

21

A

Okay.

22

Q

Now, you say there that to the extent relevant for

23

purposes of the best interest of creditors test, the

24

liquidation analysis assumes direct claims against the

25

shareholder release parties would be retained.

All right.

It just calls for a yes or no answer.

Now,

2

the disclosure statement at the section you cited also

refers creditors to statements that were filed by the

4

Sacklers in support of the Debtor’s disclosure statement.

A

Yes.

22

Q

To assess the value of direct claims against the

Sacklers in a Chapter 7 case, do you think it’s a wise

choice to rely on statements of the targets of those direct

They are.

2

those values, that would obviously put the rest of the plan

at risk and would cause the shareholder settlement to fall

apart and would potentially cost the estate billions and

billions of dollars.

Q

Connecticut would be free to pursue their direct claims

Right, Mr. Goldman?

I mean, you were just putting math to that.

MR. GOLDMAN:

And you testified that these insurance policies can be

I would say that the -- from the declarations and in

that there were approximately I want to say a dozen

Not necessarily the D&O ones, but those policies have a

number of other named insureds.

would be covered by the general liability insurance

Honor’s question, one of the other things that we obviously

looked at that I believe (indiscernible) put a declaration

in was other transfers of value that went to the IAC

companies, which indirectly benefitted the shareholders.

we were looking at the transfers of value that went to the

I do.

Q

And could you tell the Court why it is that you didn’t

Mr. DelConte, Mr. Goldman’s first question was have you

10

account or put a value on those causes of action?

11

A

12

estimate the value of those potential claims, you know,

13

based on the fact that, as I testified to before and as laid

14

out in the disclosure statement, the fact that there’s a

15

number of different causes of action that various third

16

parties could have against the shareholders, as well as a

17

number of defenses that the shareholders could have against

18

those particular causes of action and the fact that none of

19

those causes of action have been taken to judgement to date.

20

We didn’t think that we were accurately able to estimate

21

what that total value could be, so we determined that we

22

should not include that in the liquidation analysis.

Q

didn’t assign value because of the Sackler’s statements of

their defenses to those potential causes of action?

We did not.

A

That’s correct, yeah.

Q

The valuation that you express in Paragraph 22 of your

MR. TURNER:

for those people who are not that familiar with the trial

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Yes.

25

THE COURT:

Well, I guess one question only, Mr.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 81
1

Eckstein, which is there are a lot of ad hoc committees in

2

this case.

3

this case know I think the members of your ad hoc committee.

4

But could you just describe it so that the record is clear

5

as to who your client is?

6

Again, the people that have been living with

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Sure, Your Honor.

The committee

7

that I am representing is the Ad Hoc Committee of Consenting

8

States and Governmental Entities.

9

involved in the case are aware, the Ad Hoc Committee

And as parties who are

10

consists of 16 members including (indiscernible) states and

11

the PEC as well as six local governmental entities, cities,

12

and counties.

13

of Consenting States since at the outset of the case we were

14

the party that had negotiated the framework for what has now

15

evolved into the Plan of Reorganization, including the

16

initial terms of an agreement that had been reached with the

17

Sacklers subject to the work that had been done by both the

18

Ad Hoc Committee as well as the UCC and the Ad Hoc Committee

19

of Non-Consenting States.

20

consenting to (indiscernible) throughout the case and have

21

worked with the company as well as with the other parties in

22

the case closely not only on the development of the Sackler

23

settlement, but also on issues that will be the subject of

24

testimony today, including the abatement plan, the

25

allocation among states, as well as a wide variety of other

212-267-6868

And we were described as the Ad Hoc Committee

And we have continued to be

516-608-2400

Page 82
1

issues pertaining to the creation of Newco and other items

2

that are essential to the plan of reorganization.

3

So Your Honor will hear testimony from several Ad

4

Hoc Committee witnesses that will address allocation, the

5

abatement, the attorney fee structure, as well as a variety

6

of other issues that were principally focused on by the

7

members of the Ad Hoc Committee over the entire duration of

8

the case.

9

THE COURT:

Okay.

And just one other question.

10

The PEC that you referred to, that’s -- correct me if I’m

11

wrong, that’s the Plaintiff’s Executive Committee in the

12

multidistrict litigation that was pending in the Ohio

13

District Court before the filing of this Chapter 11 case?

14

MR. ECKSTEIN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

They

15

were actively involved, as Your Honor knows, in the

16

litigation from its inception and were integral members of

17

the negotiations that took place leading up to the

18

bankruptcy, including the negotiations that took place in

19

Cleveland during the spring and summer of 2019.

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. ECKSTEIN:

22

Okay.
And they’ve remained active members

of the Ad Hoc Committee throughout the Chapter 11.

23

THE COURT:

Okay, very well.

So I’m not sure

24

whether Mr. Blabey or Mr. Wagner is going to do this, but

25

I’m happy to proceed now with your witness, who is Mr.

direct.

6

He is Chief Deputy for the State of Florida.

THE COURT:

Okay.

Mr. Cahn, is there any dispute

that this is covered by the common interest agreement?

5

MR. CAHN:

No, Your Honor.

But -- and I didn’t

6

necessarily intend to argue the merits of whether or not the

7

confidentiality provisions of these pre-bankruptcy common

8

interest agreements should continue to hold under the

9

current circumstances.

I didn’t intend to argue the merits

10

of that now.

11

that I intended to ask Mr. Guard based on this document

12

(indiscernible).

13

And actually, I only have one or two questions

Your Honor, I would observe that Mr. Guard’s

14

declaration clearly puts front and center all of the

15

negotiations that took place between various states over the

16

four-plus years that these issues have been considered.

17

I think at this point in time to exclude any document or any

18

evidence that (indiscernible) this process would be giving

19

parties other than the Ad Hoc Committee and the Debtors an

20

unfair advantage here.

21

And

Nevertheless, having said that, I am happy to hold

this issue in abeyance for further discussion.

CROSS-EXAMINATION OF JOHN GUARD

Can you hear me clearly?

You say in your declaration that you first

Paragraph 12, you described the elements that relate to the

2

proposal as you first encountered it.

3

of the factors that you identify is state population.

4

other three factors, were the other three factors also

5

dependent to a considerable extent on population?

7

necessarily understand your question.

8

three factors deal with raw numbers.

12

then I guess that answers your question.

13

raw numbers of the number of occurrences that occur in each

14

state.

15

But no, they are

So the first factor was the morphine milligram

equivalents.

17

milligram equivalents, the number of pills for lack of a

18

better term, shipped into a state.

clear.

23

an example by comparing the populations of California and

24

West Virginia and noting the substantial difference in per

25

capita opioid death rate in those two states.

Right.

212-267-6868

So that would be the number of morphine

So there may be some

And I’m sorry if my question wasn’t

But, for example, in Paragraph 27, you referred to

Page 89

nevertheless, applying those figures as you’ve done in your

2

-- I’m sorry, Footnote 1 on Page 9 of your declaration, you

3

note that California would have roughly three times the

4

number of deaths that West Virginia had even though West

5

Virginia, according to your figures, West Virginians have

6

eight times the likelihood of dying from opioid abuse.

7

So isn’t that an example of how -- of necessity raw

8

population numbers affect each one of the other two

9

categories that are identified in Paragraph 12 of your

10

declaration.

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

12

THE COURT:

Objection to form.

Let me see if I can ask the question.

13

Just turning to the paragraph that Mr. Cahn referred to,

14

Paragraph 22 --

15

MR. CAHN:

16

THE COURT:

Twenty-seven, Your Honor.
I’m sorry, 27.

Do you agree that

17

there is a -- that the footnote, Footnote 1 in Paragraph 27

18

can be read as an example of how there may be more deaths in

19

a highly-populous state like California, which would be a

20

potential tie-in to the second metric in Paragraph 12, i.e.

21

an adjusted metric reflecting the approximate deaths related

22

to opioids?

23

THE WITNESS:

There is a relationship between

24

population and the metric.

25

relationship, but there is a relationship.

212-267-6868

It is not a perfect or direct

2

way, Your Honor.

3

one of them was -- what we were trying to solve for is if

4

two states have the same opioid overdose death rates and one

5

state had a population ten times smaller than the other,

6

under the approach advanced by some states, they would have

7

been treated the same even though the state that had ten

8

times more, you know, people would have had ten times the

9

number of deaths.

If two states had the exact same rate and

So the increase in population does have

10

some relationship, but it’s not just driven by population I

11

guess is my point and my quandary with the questions that I

12

was being asked.

THE COURT:

MR. CAHN:

Okay.

Mr. Cahn, you can go on.

Well, the problem with the three categories are that

And each of those metrics has issues with

For example, in some states, you do not have medical

whether causes of death are listed and what cause of death

5

states, there is a difference in the level of

underreporting.

crisis, we saw people traveling across the country to get

10

pills.

So the fact that pills were shipped and prescribed

11

in particular states and dispensed would not necessarily

12

mean that the pills ended up being consumed in that state.

13

And the third metric, the survey for pain reliever use

14

disorder order, is a self-report measure where you are

15

relying on people to say that they have a problem and

16

issue., and so, you have a huge level underreporting, and

17

that level varies by state depending on what kind of

18

substance abuse treatment and the help each state utilizes.

19

So population was added to try to -- in a way, to try to

20

deal with the issues that existed for the other metrics and

21

population was and is a typical metric that is utilized in

recognized fairly early on the limitations of the other

metrics.

Did you ever consider or did your office,

No, because General Moody's administration was trying

And so, given the limitations, given where other

10

states were and given the direction that the Attorney

11

General of the State of Florida, you know, gave me, which

12

was to try to develop consensus in a way so that we could

13

settle all these cases, not just the Purdue matter; that

14

wasn't contemplated or considered.

15

Q

16

talked about the discrepancy in the per capita death rates

17

between -- you specifically noted the difference between

18

Washington and California.

19

under your figures, West Virginians were eight times as

20

likely to die from opioid abuse as were Californians.

21

Wouldn't this argument militate in favor of being more

22

solicitous of states such as West Virginia, which has such a

23

high relative death rate?

24

A

No.

20

where you have a concentrated problem and may, you know, in

21

a perfect world, you know, it'd tell you where you need to

focus or where there needs to be something done.

23

you're looking at trying to develop an allocation or you're

24

looking at trying to figure out how money should flow, you

25

know, the fact that their rate is higher doesn't necessarily

anything.

Again, I go back to my example.

If, you know,

there's the state of Alabama and the state of Florida had

the exact same rates, Florida is, you know, many times

6

bigger than the state of Alabama and there would be more

7

people that would have opioid addiction in Florida than in

8

Alabama.

9

So, you know, I don't think that just because the

10

per capita rate is higher and even considerably higher --

11

again, I don't mean to diminish or demean what is going on

12

in West Virginia in the slightest -- I don't think that

I am not.

THE WITNESS:

Well, I think that my understanding

14

was that General Morrissey was under clinical pressure from

members of the PEC, based on his prior settlements with the

distributors, and, you know -- and also because of the

intensity that West Virginia had experienced.

A

Yes.

Q

In this section -- it's not just Paragraph 47, but the

following ones as well -- you discuss the efforts by the

email that I got from your office, that would be right.

I'd almost -- well, it turned out to be the NOAT Trust.

Obviously, the abatement strategies that

Yeah.

That is correct.

I'm unaware of it.

Q

Would you agree with me that these abatement strategies

16

are fully consensual as to all of the states and the local

17

governments, at least to the extent they've entered into

18

this agreement, as well as the federal government?

19

A

20

My understanding is that the lawyers representing all those

parties agreed to these being the abatement strategies.

22

that answers your question, then yes.

13

going on nationally now.

14

That is correct.

15

Q

As part of the government protecting -- government

participation mechanism and/or the statewide agreement, the

17

states and local governments agree to submit to the

18

jurisdiction either of this Court, if the Court retains

19

confirmation post-confirmation, or to a state court; is that

20

correct?

21

A

That is correct.

22

Q

In addition, in the last section of the NOAT, there is

23

a, I would say, a robust accountability requirement that the

24

states have voluntarily submitted to which requires us to

25

report publicly how the money is being spent; is that

mean, I think it's Delaware where the companies or the state

or otherwise incorporated or to a state court with

8

jurisdiction; is that correct?

9

A

That is also correct.

10

Q

All of these provisions that are in the NOAT are more

11

consistent with injunctive relief than they are with a

monetary settlement; would you agree with me?

is being split up here and we're not cutting it up into

16

tiny, tiny amounts, which is what would happen if we each

17

had our claims, you know, I don't -- you know, we do

18

settlements all the time that condition use of money on

19

specific purposes, and I don't ever think that is

20

injunctive.

I don't know about that.

21

I think, you know, money can

I mean, the tobacco settlement itself, at least

22

the Florida version of it, had limitations on it.

other settlements -- National Mortgage settlement, BP

So I don't think I agree with your -- that

it's injunctive relief.

Q

4

But in this case, the parties are asking this Court to enter

5

those terms and subject states and local governments to

6

court oversight on the terms.

7

than the voluntary settlements, and there is a court order

8

that is being contemplated (sound drops).

9

A

Right, and that's a fair point and a good distinction.

That does make it different

Well, I mean, it's a bankruptcy case, so there are -- I

10

mean, in other cases, their work in National -- I mean,

11

National Mortgage settlement, I believe there was a Federal

12

District Court consent order.

13

guess it's what I'm struggling with is there are -- in each

14

one of those kinds of cases, there is some kind of court

15

mechanism that reflects limitations, so I guess that's what

16

I'm struggling with.

17

Q

18

settlement could not have come together without the

19

abatement lists that you have described here.

20

A

21

the high level of voting at the levels that are -- of yes

22

votes that have happened in this case without having some

23

lists of what the money is going for.

24

know, rightfully or wrongfully, you know, there was, at

25

least in one point in time, a lack of trust between states

All right.

So, you know, I don't -- I

We'll move on then.

It is true that this

I think that it would have been very difficult to get

Because I -- you

and their localities on how settlement monies were being

2

spent.

3

And so, what the list has done is kind of, it

prevented those suspicions and those concerns, so it's

allayed them in a way that allows the settlement to happen.

MR. O'NEILL:

I am also objecting, Your Honor.

they're objecting?

2

This is rather --

THE COURT:

Well, let me -- I'm not sure what the

3

objection is and that's partly because people are talking

4

over each other, so let me hear from the two objectors.

5

What's the basis for the objection?

6

MR. FOGELMAN:

Your Honor, this is Larry Fogelman

7

from the United States Attorney's Office.

Mr. Guard's

8

opinion about whether a hypothetical of 49 out of 50 states,

9

whether that constitutes justice in Mr. Huebner's whatever

10

example he's giving, is simply irrelevant and calls for

11

speculation.

12

allowed the answer the question.

13
14

There's no foundation, and he should not be

THE COURT:

Okay.

Let me hear from the other

objectors too.

15

MR. O'NEILL:

Your Honor, my objection is also

16

that it's a hypothetical and also, frankly, goes to the

17

ultimate issue that's before this Court since the Court has

18

to make this determination in the real situation of this

19

case with 20 percent of the states objecting.

20

THE COURT:

I guess -- I'm not sure if it is a

21

hypothetical in the sense that the State of West Virginia

22

has its own unique objection.

23

MR. O'NEILL:

Fair enough.

24

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, if now would be a good

Mr. Huebner's point, that Mr. Guard may be authorized to

speak for the State of Florida, but his -- he is not

authorized to speak for the State of Maryland.

10

I join the objection as stated by Mr. Robinson-

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, may I address the

objection?

11

THE COURT:

Can I just -- let me -- I'm going to

12

try to cut this short.

13

even Mr. O'Neill's or someone's question -- no, actually, it

14

was Mr. Cahn's questioning today, witnesses were asked,

15

including Mr. Guard today by Mr. Cahn, is something fair or

16

is something just.

In the questioning yesterday and

23

perhaps even that it's not just.

24

who are not lawyers to appreciate that those determinations

25

are not really what is before the Court, except as they are

212-267-6868

It is, I think, clear that someone whose child

incorporated into the legal standards that I need to follow.

2

So I think, frankly, those questions are a

3

distraction, although they're certainly moral questions with

4

great weight, but they're a distraction in this case unless

5

they're tied to a particular standard that I need to rule

6

on.

7

I let the question be asked yesterday.

But I

8

think people should be quite careful as the same folks who

9

were asking it yesterday, I recognize today, in straying

10

from what is really at issue before the Court, which is the

11

legal standard I need to apply.

12

So I will overrule -- I'm sorry.

I will not

13

permit the question to be asked, unless it's tied to the

14

standard that I need to apply.

15

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, I think, as was true

16

yesterday when the objectors asked this exact question, this

17

is really for oral argument, and I will reserve my views on

18

many of these topics for then.

19

THE COURT:

20

All right.

So you didn't have

any other questions, Mr. Huebner?

21
22

Okay.

MR. HUEBNER:

I don't, Your Honor.

much.

Does anyone else have any

Page 115
1

questions for Mr. Guard?

2

I have a couple of questions for you, sir, and

3

maybe I just couldn't hear you clearly enough on this.

4

testimony was quite clear that the quite complex and,

5

obviously at this point, very widely accepted opioid

6

abatement strategies that would be under this plan are

7

actually being proposed and even implemented in other

8

contexts involving opioid litigation, and you've named a

9

couple of cases of settlements and a pending bankruptcy case

10

Your

where that's proposed.

11

I want to take you back to the allocations among

12

states that was the subject of the first cross-examination

13

of you today.

14

developed with no particular case in mind, although I think

15

I also took away from your declaration that the Purdue case

16

certainly led the attorneys' general to focus their

17

attention even more than it had been focused on, on coming

18

up with what they believe was an allocation mechanism that

19

they could agree to.

20
21

And I think I heard you state that these were

Has this mechanism of allocating just the money
among the states been implemented in other contexts yet?

22

THE WITNESS:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's been

23

implemented in the McKinsey settlement that occurred earlier

24

this year or, I guess it was earlier this year or the year

25

previous.

212-267-6868

And then also while the numbers slightly changed

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 116
1

because in each instance, there are different states that

2

have settled with a particular defendant.

3

And so, while the numbers for Florida have not

4

changed, numbers for the states like West Virginia and some

5

of the other smaller states changed by settlement because

6

they are the beneficiaries of the kind of the shifting of

7

monies for each one of these sums.

8
9

THE COURT:

Because not necessarily every state's

a party to it?

10

THE WITNESS:

11

THE COURT:

12

THE WITNESS:

That is correct.
Okay.
Or in -- they're like in -- for

13

example, in this case, Oklahoma settled before the

14

bankruptcy.

15

THE COURT:

16

THE WITNESS:

Right.
And the distributor case, West

17

Virginia settled with all three distributors prior to our

18

settlement being announced.

19

THE COURT:

20

THE WITNESS:

21

Okay, thank you.
And West Virginia and Oklahoma are

about equal as far as the allocations they had.

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

My other question is related to

23

the portion of your declaration that deals with the part of

24

the phase one mediation that addressed how to split monies

25

between private and public creditors, and you talk about

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 117
1

that at Paragraph 66, 67, et cetera.

2

In the declaration and your testimony today, it

3

comes through that there was heavy negotiation among the

4

states as states and then among the states on the one side

5

and other governmental entities on the other.

6

characterize the negotiation among the states and

7

governmental entities on the one hand and the private

8

creditors on the other?

9

THE WITNESS:

How would you

Probably actually more intense than

10

the first two, which was surprising.

11

-- when you deal with -- usually deal with parties that are

12

more like commercial creditors, you would think it'd be

13

easier, but it was not.

14

THE COURT:

15

they represented by?

16

THE WITNESS:

I thought it would be

And those private creditors, who were

They each had a group of counsel,

17

which was a subset of, I guess, the nationwide counsel that

18

represented each group or set of individuals.

19

negotiating committee like we had a negotiating committee.

20

THE COURT:

Okay.

So they had a

And they included -- those

21

creditors or claimants included individuals who were injured

22

by opioids?

23

THE WITNESS:

At some of the meetings, some of the

24

PI or personal injury family members were present and made

25

presentations to us.

212-267-6868

They were not necessarily in some of

Veritext Legal Solutions

the negotiations, so it was just their lawyers, but their

2

lawyers did bring them to and have them make very impactful

3

presentations to the negotiating parties and the committee.

5

THE COURT:

some cases, their individual clients.

So it was both the lawyers and, in

Yes.
Okay.

All right.

Does anyone have

any questions on that?

9

MR. FOGELMAN:

questions on redirect, clarify a couple of points.

BY MR. FOGELMAN:

15

Q

16

Just so that it's clear, I'm right that the population 31

17

percent, that's 31 percent of the 85 percent under the plan,

18

correct?

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

And the other 15 percent, is population a factor at

21

all?

22

A

No, it is not.

23

Q

You alluded to this during your -- during the cross.

24

But is Florida advantaged or disadvantaged by the inclusion

Was there a specific written agreement to that fact?

3

Do you see that?

4

A

I do.

5

Q

And when you say the position set forth in Section 5.2,

6

am I right that you were referring to the position that is

7

set forth in the sentence quoted above in Paragraph 11?

8

A

Yes.

9

Q

Okay.

So in other words, you're not offering an

10

opinion regarding any other portions of Section 5.2 of the

11

plan; is that right?

12

A

That's correct.

13

Q

And then turning to Paragraph 13 of your declaration,

14

it says, "To test the accuracy of Section 5.2 of the plan, I

15

analyzed the magnitude of the Debtors' liabilities arising

16

out of or in connection with opioid claims, i.e., minimum

17

opioid claim liability, as compared to the value of the

assets."

19

A

Yes.

Q

And when you refer in that sentence to the Debtors

21

liabilities arising out of or in connection with opioid

22

claims, am I right that you're referring to that in the

23

aggregate for all of the Debtors?

24

A

For all of the Debtors?

25

Q

Yeah.

5

6

all of the liabilities associated with the Debtor.

at all the Debtors' liabilities together in the aggregate,

points where it expresses opinions that I think go beyond

the nuts and bolts of what happened.

in light of a number of factors, including the costs and

21

risks of litigation, but also the views of interested

22

parties in ultimately determining whether the settlement is

23

a proper exercise of judgment.

24
25

But again, I will note

I think the courts asked for the views of
interested parties for a number of reasons, including to

212-267-6868

Page 135
1

determine whether the parties who negotiated the settlement,

2

negotiated it at arms' length on a reasonably well-informed

3

basis, which includes their representation by counsel and

4

their understanding of the legal issues and the other issues

5

that affect the settlement.

6

So I don't view this as expert testimony.

I don't

7

view it as necessarily stating the truth of the underlying

8

issues or someone's view of the underlying issues, but I do

9

believe that it's perfectly appropriate to admit it as a

10

description of what a party playing an important role in the

11

negotiations perceived those negotiations and how they

12

unfolded.

13

So I guess unless you identify some particular

14

paragraph that crosses the line on those issues, my

15

inclination is, to the extent this is an objection, to

16

overrule it.

17
18

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Your Honor, this is Mr. Eckstein.

Can I just make one observation on this point?

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

20

MR. ECKSTEIN:

I would like to just make clear for

21

the record that Mr. Gotto, like Mr. Guard, served throughout

22

the case as a member of the ad hoc committee, not as counsel

23

to the ad hoc committee, and in that capacity, they

24

functioned essentially as principals in the case.

25

is -- and he was also a member of the subcommittee that was

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And this

516-608-2400

Page 136
1

responsible for negotiating the abatement plans.

2

And so, this declaration is provided as actual

3

testimony based upon Mr. Gotto's activities as a principal

4

of the ad hoc committee and a participant in the abatement

5

subcommittee.

6
7

THE COURT:

It's clear from his

declaration that he's a negotiating party.

8
9

Right.

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, I think my objection may

be satisfied by your statement that the matters that are

10

admitted may not be considered, you know, for the truth of

11

what's in them and they're just party opinions.

12

parties need to (sound glitch) in court.

13

THE COURT:

Well, it depends -- I mean, it depends

14

on how -- what matters you're referring to.

15

of analysis of litigation, absolutely.

16

MR. EDMUNDS:

17

THE COURT:

I think the

Yes, in terms

Yeah.
If it's reporting on the course of a

18

negotiation, that's fact testimony and it's what the witness

19

perceived, not anything more than that.

20
21

MR. EDMUNDS:

My objection is just with respect to

the former, not the latter.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. EDMUNDS:

24

Thank you, Your Honor.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Okay.
So I think that that covers it.

Very well.

So I will admit Mr.

Gotto's declaration.

2

MR. BLABEY:

Your Honor, I'm not sure if any party

wishes to cross, but I would just note that you had asked

Professor Gowrisankaran a question yesterday about the

creation of the note TDP.

They're really two different witnesses and two

10

different questions.

So I may have that question asked at

11

some point, but I don't think we need to get that out at

12

this point.

13

So does anyone want to cross-examine Mr. Gotto?

I'll wait for you to get there.

A

I'm there.

10

Q

And actually, I meant Paragraph 9.

11

A

Okay.

12

Q

At the -- in the representation or in the negotiation

13

of this trust, would you agree with me that abatement and

14

the public good that the money could be spent was at the

15

core of the negotiations?

16

A

Absolutely.

17

Q

And you understand the NOAT Trust to bind the state,

18

for example, the State of Washington, to follow either a

19

separate agreement or the default conditions that are in the

20

NOAT Trust on how to spend the money; is that correct?

its terms, including the terms on how the money is going to

be expended.

That's my understanding.

Q

which would allow King County or any other municipality in

requirement that the money be spent on abatement, are you?

12

A

I'm not aware of any.

13

Q

Thank you.

14

That's all the questions I've got for you.

THE COURT:

Okay.
Okay.

Does anyone else want to cross-

15

examine Mr. Gotto?

Mr. Gotto, I've reviewed your

16

declaration, and I just -- I want to make sure I'm looking

17

for one note.

18

there any redirect?

No, I don't have any questions on it.

19

MR. BLABEY:

20

THE COURT:

21

question you wanted to get in.

22

Is

No, Your Honor.
Okay, all right.

Well, I will ask the

Mr. Gotto, did you have a role in negotiating and

23

preparing the terms of the NOAT Trust, including for

24

distribution purposes?

25

THE WITNESS:

212-267-6868

Yes, Your Honor, certainly in the

www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 140

context of the abatement term sheet that was agreed upon in

2

2020, which then is essentially becomes the NOAT Trust TDP.

4

THE COURT:

Okay, all right.

Thank you.

All

right, you can sign off, sir.

5

MR. GROTTO:

6

THE COURT:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you.

All right.

The next

7

witness is Mr. Weinberger.

8

don't know whether there's going to be -- whether there's

9

any estimate of how long he will take.

10

MR. BLABEY:

It's about quarter to 1:00.

I

Your Honor, Mr. Weinberger, as I

11

believe Mr. Kaminetzky had indicated in his communication to

12

chambers, is not available until 2:00.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. BLABEY:

15

All right.
So now could be a good time for a

lunch break if we wanted to.

16

THE COURT:

Okay, that's fine.

That's where I was

17

heading anyway.

So we'll break and return at 2:00.

18

could just make sure Mr. Weinberger is ready to testify at

19

that point and we'll proceed then with him.

Would you raise your right hand, please?

affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but

the truth, so help you God?

9

MR. WEINBERGER:

10

THE COURT:

Do you swear or

I will.

Okay.

Thank you.

Mr. Weinberger, you

11

submitted a Declaration in this matter dated August 5, 2021,

12

under my Order establishing procedures for this hearing.

13

was intended to be your direct testimony.

14

that and sitting where you are today on August 13th, is

15

there anything in your Declaration that you would wish to

16

change?

17

MR. WEINBERGER:

18

THE COURT:

Understanding

No, Your Honor.

Okay.

Does anyone object to the

19

admission of Mr. Weinberger's Declaration as his direct

20

testimony?

21

cross-examine Mr. Weinberger?

22

Okay.

It

I will admit it.

Does anyone want to

Okay.

Mr. Weinberger, I had a couple of questions for

23

you assuming that, again, there's no cross.

24

to the discussion that you have on the attorneys' fees

25

provision in Section 5.8 of the Plan and that starts at

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

The first goes

516-608-2400

Page 142
1

paragraph 55 of your Declaration.

You note that the Plan

2

and that Section establishes two separate funds for

3

attorneys' fees.

4

received by the National (indiscernible) Abatement Trust and

5

Tribal Abatement Trust Fund not to exceed $500 million.

6

then the second is described in paragraph 57, is 5 percent

7

of each of the settlements reached with the groups of

8

private creditors.

9

fund is to be allocated or awarded by a third-party panel of

One is from 10 percent of the money

And

The -- as I understand it, the first

10

arbitrators and then, ultimately, the Court retains

11

jurisdiction over both payment and appeals from that panel.

12

And that's with regard to $275 million to be allocated.

13

then it says, the remaining $225 million will be allocated

14

by the states according to their internal processes.

just wanted you to elaborate on that last sentence.

knowledge, how is that allocated among the states?

still to be resolved?

mechanism if they are not able to reach an agreement?

And

And if so, is there a default

MR. WEINBERGER:

Your Honor, I don't have personal

21

knowledge with which to answer that question because, as

22

liaison counsel for the MDL, I have only personal knowledge

23

as to what the Plan procedure is with respect to the monies

24

that go into the MDL, which is the $275 million.

MR. WEINBERGER:

THE COURT:

And so, in that

Okay.
-- with respect to --

That's fine.

It wasn't clear to me,

8

and I guess I'll have to ask counsel for one or more of the

9

states about that section.

The other question I had is, I

10

want to take you back to the first part of your Declaration

11

where you, in paragraph 6, discuss your experience in mass

12

tort situations and your role as court appointed Plaintiff's

13

Executive Committee counsel or co-counsel in a number of

14

different multi-district litigations.

15

that you're currently serving as court appointed Plaintiff's

16

lead liaison counsel and counsel to the Plaintiff's

17

Executive Committee in the multi-state -- I'm sorry, the

18

multi-district litigation in Cleveland.

19

bankruptcy case, included in a very large measure, Purdue

20

Pharma, as well as involved the Sackler family members.

21

I'm inferring, but I would like your answer to this

22

question, that in that role, you and the other Plaintiffs

23

that you're working with, have a goal to maximize recoveries

24

in respect of those claims.

25

make?

212-267-6868

And then you state

Which, until this

So,

Is that a fair inference to

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 144

MR. WEINBERGER:

2

THE COURT:

3

In fact, that is your role, I

gather?

4
5

Okay.

That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. WEINBERGER:
highest of our priorities.

6

THE COURT:

Okay.

Very much so.

That is the

Yes, Your Honor.
And you're familiar, I assume,

7

with the fact that under this Plan, the Bankruptcy Plan

8

that's before me, that is, not only would the debtor or the

9

debtors get a discharge, but there would be broad releases

10

of the released parties and shareholder released parties,

11

which would include the Sackler family and their companies.

12

We've heard testimony and exhibits as to the potential

13

liability of those third parties to creditors of these

14

debtors.

15

knowing your primary, really exclusive, role to maximize

16

recoveries, why would your clients -- why do your clients

17

support that aspect of the settlement in this Plan, the

18

settlement of the third-party claims?

19

And I'm not asking to evaluate that liability, but

MR. WEINBERGER:

Your Honor, any time one

20

evaluates a settlement, whether in a bankruptcy scenario

21

such as this one, or in any other case, in evaluating any

22

settlement, one takes into account what is the liability,

23

whether there is potential recovery and what is, in terms of

24

damages, and what is the defendant's ability to pay.

25

this case, where, admittedly, the abatement costs associated

enormous and far exceeds what has been proposed in this

3

bankruptcy, the plaintiff's lawyers in the MDL and the PEC,

4

specifically the 21 firms who lead this and who have

5

appointed me as liaison counsel with the court's consent,

6

have evaluated all those factors and waived continued

7

litigation against the Sackler family and Purdue versus what

has been offered and have determined that this is an

9

appropriate, fair, settlement in light of all those

10

circumstances.

And it is why we recommend that it be

THE COURT:

13

MR. WEINBERGER:

14

Okay.
I might add, if you don't mind,

Your Honor, to that answer.

15

THE COURT:

Go ahead.

16

MR. WEINBERGER:

Since my Declaration and my

17

testimony is directed to Section 5.8, that the other factor

18

that is extremely important is that, as Judge Polster stated

19

from the very beginning, the importance of this litigation

20

is to maximize the recovery of costs associated with abating

21

the epidemic.

22

of fees, that would go into this fund as well as associated

23

issues associated with contingent (indiscernible) contracts

24

which, the political subdivisions are being relieved of, is

25

further -- furthers our goal of putting as much money into

the abatement remedy as possible under these circumstances

2

and this, Your Honor, takes into account the fact that -- I

3

can speak for myself and for my colleagues, I have devoted

4

nearly four years of my professional life, full-time, on

5

this project, as have hundreds of lawyers represented by the

6

21 Plaintiff's Executive Committee firms and firms outside

lawyer, the importance of creating an abatement fund to deal

9

with this national health crisis, is our number one

10

And I can tell you that, to a person, to a

priority.

THE COURT:

Okay.

Thank you.

Q

In any of the other abatement work on opioids, are you

aware of the state being forced into a non-consensual

I wasn't getting too far off field, but I think for

clarification purposes, if you don't mind --

Q

So, for example, with respect to the settlement

settlement.

I can't speak to any particular individuals,

board members of all those corporate entities.

Q

12

would ask you is, in the context of this case, does your

support for the Confirmation Plan in any way condone the

14

activities of the Sacklers in management of Purdue Pharma

conduct and in fact, I think it is our efforts that

18

uncovered that the direct conduct and behavior of a number

19

of members of the Sackler family in the way in which the

20

company was directly operated by them, and our litigation

21

strategy to pursue the Sackler family, was, I believe, a

22

significant factor in bringing the Sackler family to the

23

table to tender with Purdue almost $5.5 billion, which --

I'm not trying to pat ourselves on the back.

do, as litigators, and in representing more than 2,000

paragraph 10 of this opinion by taking a snippet, which

11

(indiscernible) very clear in that first sentence, is simply

12

a foundational assumption excluded the time period between

THE COURT:

With one exception.

There've been a

couple witnesses who might have to come back, depending on

whether parties that might have testimony have resolved

their underlying issue, so they cannot listen after the --

after they've testified, until that's clarified that they

won't -- there's no chance that they'd be coming back to

testify.

Certainly.

I didn't hear what you said.

You refer in that Paragraph 7 to certain

I just want to make sure that you're focused on

Did you make an assessment regarding the

10

strength of the claims that those releases would release?

11

So I've been advised by Counsel to the B side about --

12
13

MR. JOSEPH:

Objection.

Don't disclose privileged

information.

14

THE WITNESS:

15

THE COURT:

Of course.
Okay.

So the question was did you

16

make an assessment of the strength of the underlying claims

17

that are being released.

18

Right, Mr. Gold?

19

MR. GOLD:

20

THE COURT:

I think that was the question.

That is correct, Your Honor.
All right.

So you should respond only

21

to the extent that you're not disclosing privileged

22

information, either attorney work product or attorney-client

23

communications.

24
25

THE WITNESS:

So I think the answer would be yes,

I have made an assessment.

Mr. Lynam's subsequent statement that he evaluated such

THE COURT:

Is there -- I think what Mr. Joseph is

13

saying is, is there a paragraph in his declaration where he

14

states that claims being released are weak or meritless?

15

MR. GOLD:

16

that determination.

17

THE COURT:

18

MR. JOSEPH:

No, I'm asking him now whether he made

I'm going to object to going beyond

19

the scope of the direct examination.

21

to provide expert testimony as a lawyer.

22

THE COURT:

He's not here to

He is a lawyer, and he's not here

I think -- I think that's correct.

I

23

think the declaration goes to only the statement that --

24

well, it's summarized in Paragraph 10 -- that the Side B

25

family and Side B shareholder payment parties, he would not

Page 200
1

recommend entering into the settlement under the plan unless

2

they received the releases of the related parties under the

3

plan.

4

Now, you can ask him why he reached that

5

conclusion, but I think you can't ask him out of the blue

6

how he evaluated the claims.

7

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, if I may, I will withdraw -

8

- I think my question can be clarified with reference to

9

another statement in his declaration that I believe will

10

show that his statement -- his declaration goes a bit beyond

11

Your Honor's summary, so maybe I can proceed with that, and

12

then we'll return to the question.

13

THE COURT:

Okay.

14

BY MR. GOLD:

15

Q

16

Paragraph 8 of your declaration?

17

A

Yes.

18

Q

And I'm going to read a section, and I will ask that

19

anyone note if I am reading it incorrectly.

20

"History has shown that Plaintiffs will pursue individuals

21

in litigation related to the Debtors even if the individual

22

has title or no connection to the Debtors."

part I just read from?

24

A

Yes, I do.

25

Q

Okay.

Okay.

212-267-6868

Mr. Lynam, will you refer to or look at Page 4,

Now, when you referred to an individual having

little or no connection to the Debtors, was that statement

2

meant to be a shorthand for indicating that the claims

3

against such individuals would be weak?

4

A

5

that people who have little or no connection to the Debtors,

6

to Purdue Pharma U.S., are called in to this litigation, and

7

I give examples in the next few sentences.

No.

It's intended -- it's intended to reflect the fact

I understand, but what is the relevance of their

The relevance is that these are individuals who have

11

little or no connection with the Debtors, yet they were

12

still subjected to very extensive discovery.

13

Q

14

connection to the Debtors and yet there were strong claims

15

that could be asserted against them, would it not make sense

16

that they would be subjected to discovery or actions?

I understand, but are you -- if they had little or no

MR. JOSEPH:

It's an inappropriate question.

19

factual as to why the releases need to be as they are.

20

MR. GOLD:

Objection.

It's a hypothetical.
His statements are very

Your Honor, I disagree.

He could

21

recite that the parties had brown hair, and that might be

22

very factual, but we would be wondering why he thought it

23

was relevant to mention that they had brown hair.

24

asking in this context --

25

THE COURT:

I am

I take the statement to mean that Mr.

Page 202
1

Lynam is justifying the grant of a release even to people

2

that have a remote connection to the Debtors to respond to

3

the argument why would someone who has a remote connection

4

to the Debtors need a release.

5

And I think normally, if someone's -- he's

6

equating remote connection to the Debtors as being a

7

bystander, like for example, a grandchild, you know, a

8

minor.

9

would -- there would be an insistence that they get a

And his declaration goes to why even that person

release.

11

But again, the declaration goes to the basic

12

question, which is why is the release so broad, not to the

13

merits of the claims that are being released.

14

MR. GOLD:

15

THE COURT:

16

Understood, Your Honor.
So again, you can ask him why, you

know, they -- why someone would be included in the release.

17

MR. GOLD:

18

THE COURT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I will move on.

But I don't think -- put it

19

differently.

I don't think this is -- this declaration is

20

being offered to try to convince me that because it's

21

unlikely someone should get sued, it doesn't matter whether

22

they get a release or not.

23

being offered.

I don't think that's why it's

24

I think it's being offered to show why people that

one would normally think might not be entitled to a release,

the Sacklers still think that they should get a release.

2

It's not evaluating the claims.

3

the release is as broad as it is.

4

It's trying to explain why

And you can certainly ask questions about that

5

because I think that's what the declaration is all about.

6

Why is it so broad?

7

MR. GOLD:

I understand, Your Honor, and I am

trying -- and I think you will see, hopefully successfully -

- to tailor my questions to what's within the declaration.

THE COURT:

Okay.
Is that what you're referencing?
That's fine.

Let me make -- let me

11

turn to one other definition, which is the definition of the

12

shareholder released parties.

13
14

THE WITNESS:
Your Honor.

15

Do you have that handy?

I do not have it in front of me,

(Indiscernible) have it handy.

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

I guess my question

16

goes primarily to the aspect of related parties that

17

includes independent contractors, subcontractors, agents,

18

and consultants, and separately, affiliates.

19

with the first group first -- not the affiliates but the

20

other group.

21

So let me deal

Are you aware that McKinsey did work for Purdue

for which it has entered into a settlement with certain

THE WITNESS:

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Yes.
Okay.

I am aware of that.
Would the shareholder release,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 208
1

using this language, cover McKinsey?

2

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, to the extent that

3

McKinsey would have been an agent of the Debtor's and it's a

4

civil claim, my understanding is that it possibly could be

5

covered.

6

THE COURT:

As part of the shareholder release?

7

I'm just focusing on your declaration, which says that the

8

Side B shareholder parties and the shareholder payment

9

parties wouldn't enter into the Sackler settlement with a

10

plan release.

11

consider a company like McKinsey that acted as an advisor or

12

constant?

13

And I'm -- and in saying that, do you

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, I consider the

14

definition to be very broad because it's reflecting the

15

purpose of what it's trying to get at, which is global

16

peace.

17

think an advisor like McKinsey may be picked up.

18

have the language in front of me, though, so I'm just

19

telling you my interpretation of how I view the scope of

20

this language.

21
22

So through that prism, the way I analyze it, I do

MR. JOSEPH:

I do not

Your Honor, McKinsey is an excluded

party, so --

23

THE COURT:

I understand McKinsey, but I'm saying

24

if there was someone -- some company like McKinsey that had

25

engaged in what McKinsey has now revealed to have -- I guess

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 209
1

for the reason why it's excluded.

2

party, would it be covered?

3

THE WITNESS:

4

question to me or --

5

THE COURT:

6

THE WITNESS:

Unless it's an excluded

Your Honor, are you directing the

Yes.
Yes.

Yes.

Yeah.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

Sorry.

Yes.

Yes.

7

Again, the breadth of this release is a function of its

8

purpose, which is to achieve global peace, so I would expect

9

McKinsey to be covered if it's not excluded explicitly.

10

THE COURT:

And why would -- and I appreciate

11

McKinsey itself is excluded, but let's assume for the moment

12

that a company that didn't -- that engaged in the assignment

13

that it did for Purdue that was not excluded, why would it

14

be necessary for global peace that it be covered by the

15

release?

16

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, the nature of this

17

litigation is such that global peace, in my view as a

18

fiduciary for Jonathan Sackler's family, is the only way to

19

have people move on with their lives.

20

against any party runs the risk of, in my view, pulling Jon

21

Sackler's family back into litigation, or if not the family

22

members themselves, possibly the trusts.

23

THE COURT:

A pending lawsuit

Well, can I explore that?

24

maybe I shouldn't be using the word McKinsey.

25

just call it M Co. or X Co.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

The -Maybe let's

516-608-2400

Page 210
1

X Co. isn't contributing to the settlement, right?

2

No consultant or subcontractor is paying under the

3

settlement, correct?

4

THE WITNESS:

5

THE COURT:

Correct.

Correct.

And so is it the case that the only

6

way that those who are paying into the settlement would be

7

dragged into litigation against X Co., that they would have

8

to provide discovery or be deposed?

9
10

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, could you rephrase the

last part of your question?

11

THE COURT:

12

THE WITNESS:

13

THE COURT:

14

THE WITNESS:

15

THE COURT:

Sure.
I do not understand it.
I took it from your answer -Yes.
-- to my prior question that the

16

people who are putting up the money, either directly or

17

through their companies, their equity in this case.

18

-

19
20

THE WITNESS:
-- I'm sorry.

21

Don't -

But could you rephrase the question

Go ahead.

THE COURT:

Don't want to have a risk that a

22

consultant like X Co. be subject to a Purdue-related

23

litigation, and I took it from your answer that it's because

24

they don't want to be dragged into that litigation, that the

25

people who are paying don't want to be dragged into the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 211
1

litigation, but I'm asking you how would they be dragged in

2

other than as a witness or someone providing discovery?

3

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, I'm not sure they would

4

be dragged in other than as a witness or providing

5

discovery.

But --

6

THE COURT:

7

THE WITNESS:

8

THE COURT:

9

THE WITNESS:

10

THE COURT:

Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
I think that answers the question.
Okay.

And let me turn then to the

11

other aspect that I focused on here, which is affiliates.

12

Do affiliates cover any company that the shareholder release

13

parties have more than a 20 percent interest in?

14

THE WITNESS:

So Your Honor, I don't have the

15

definition of affiliates as that term is used in the plan in

16

front of me.

17
18

It can be a simple term.

THE COURT:
can tell.

19

It's not a defined term as far as I

It's a lowercase affiliates.
THE WITNESS:

Okay.

So then I would interpret

20

affiliates to be defined by the concept of control, so any

21

entity that's under the control of the shareholder release

22

parties, such as the trust fund, the benefit of the Sackler

23

family.

24
25

We get the benefit of the release as well.
THE COURT:

Okay.

And does that apply not only to

affiliates that would be either directly or indirectly

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 212
1

contributing to the settlement but to other affiliates as

2

well?

3

THE WITNESS:

4

THE COURT:

5

Yes.
Okay.

It would cover all affiliates.
And the rationale for that is

what?

6

THE WITNESS:

So from my experience working with

7

the Jonathan Sackler family, there are many, many entities

8

in the structure for the trusts and for the investments that

9

they own.

10

If we did not include affiliates, we only included

11

the owners within the scope of the release, I would be

12

concerned that there would be a loophole, so to speak, in

13

the release where underlying entities that are affiliates

14

that have value, sometimes significant value, would still be

15

subject to lawsuits.

16

THE COURT:

17

THE WITNESS:

Related to Purdue?
Yes because if they're excluded from

18

the release, I would expect that they could be subject to

19

lawsuits related to Purdue, even if they have little or no

20

connection to Purdue.

21

THE COURT:

What if they actually did have

22

connection to Purdue and were not contributing to the

23

settlement?

24
25

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, I think the entities

that -- I'll give you an example of an entity that I

immediately recognize needs the definition you're

2

describing.

3

It would be like some of the independent

4

associated companies, some of the non-U.S. businesses.

5

Those are affiliates of the Sackler family, so to speak,

6

generally speaking.

this settlement, and the proceeds are being paid to fund the

8

$4.325 billion cash (indiscernible).

9

They are being sold in connection with

THE COURT:

No, I -- my question when to

10

affiliates that were not contributing, whose assets were not

11

being contributed.

12

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, again, I think that any

13

entity that's left out there that is an affiliate of the

14

Sackler family, even if it had no connection to Purdue, I

15

would be concerned as a fiduciary that that entity would be

16

sued.

17

just the volume of the lawsuits.

And it's not necessarily the merit of the case.

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

It's

Let me go on this point, and

19

I'm going to have to read this to you, I think, because I

20

don't think you have it in front of you.

21

you would because it's not referenced in your declaration.

22

But the section of the plan which starts at Page 122, it's

23

headed "releases by releasing parties."

24
25

There's no reason

So I guess I wanted to focus on a couple of
aspects of this.

212-267-6868

One aspect of the release, it's Subheading

8 -- (indiscernible) 8 -- is release of any past, present,

or future use or misuse of any opioid.

3

affiliated company sells an opioid in the future, is this

4

intended to cover that company where there's a claim against

5

it?

6

THE WITNESS:

And I -- if an

Your Honor, I'm not sure.

But if

7

the settlement is consummated, there is actually a covenant

8

and settlement agreement saying that certain members of the

9

Sackler family and trust for their benefit cannot be --

10

THE COURT:

I understand.

I understand, but I'm

11

talking about affiliates, and I just want to make sure.

12

not sure the answer to this question, and maybe you're not

13

the right one to ask it because I think it may be more

14

appropriate to ask the people who drafted this.

15

But I think I can pose this question to you.

I'm

If

16

an affiliate run by someone else -- not run by the Sacklers

17

-- is selling opium -- opioids, the Sacklers are out of it,

18

so they don't have the ability to control it, so it would

19

have to be another definition of affiliate, like 20 percent

20

owner.

21

the future, of future sales, why would the Sacklers want to

22

be shielded -- have it be shielded from liability?

23

And it sells opioids and has a liability for that in

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, again, I don't have the

24

language in front of me.

25

that you are referencing, but I would think that these

212-267-6868

I'm not actually sure what it is

THE WITNESS:

5

THE COURT:

6

THE WITNESS:

7

THE COURT:

Okay.

Which is really tied to more

Correct.
-- sort of spillover liability.
Correct.
Okay.

It is not clear to me from your

8

declaration whether Purdue Canada is on Side A or Side B, or

9

is it both?

10

THE WITNESS:

11

THE COURT:

It is on both.
Okay.

So I approved a settlement

12

earlier this week where the Sacklers agreed in return for

13

the release of claims against the estate -- significant

14

claims -- to carve out from the release the Canadian

15

provinces.

16

THE WITNESS:

Correct.

Well, my understanding of

17

that stipulation, Your Honor, is that Canadian provinces

18

withdrew their proofs of claim.

19

there was an acknowledgement that the release contemplated

20

by this Chapter 11 plan does not extend to claims brought by

21

non-U.S. persons in non-U.S. jurisdictions --

22

THE COURT:

And in exchange for that,

Yes.

But it's limited to those provinces,

correct?

6

THE WITNESS:

8

That is my understanding, Your

Correct.
THE COURT:

That agreement wouldn't extend, for

9

example, to Mr. Underwood's clients, the handful of non-

10

provincial government -- any of these in Indian -- First

11

Nation peoples that he represents.

12
13

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, I'm not sure.

I'm not

familiar how provinces bind municipalities in Canada.

14

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, no.

I'm not saying that.

15

It may perfectly be the case, not knowing Canadian law, that

16

they're bound by the province's agreement.

17

But the -- leaving aside the carveout in the

18

release for those provinces, as you've described it and is

19

set forth in the settlement agreement, that is, and the

20

carveout for the United States, there are no carveouts for

21

other foreign creditors and similar limitations, if they

22

haven't asserted a claim against the Debtors, I gather.

23

Right?

24
25

THE WITNESS:

That is my understanding.

Particularly, I believe what you're referencing for conduct

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 217

that's unrelated to the United States.

2

THE COURT:

3

THE WITNESS:

4

THE COURT:

Correct.
Correct.
So if, for example, a foreign party

5

has a claim based upon conduct that occurred because of a

6

foreign entity, other than the settling provinces or the

7

provinces that are carved out of the release, they would be

8

bound by this release?

9

THE WITNESS:

Just to confirm I understand your

10

question, are you asking me if foreign governments, or

11

foreign entities, or foreign plaintiffs generally speaking?

12

THE COURT:

Well, I'll use one of Mr. Underwood's

13

clients as an example.

14

based on conduct by Purdue Canada.

15

THE WITNESS:

Let's say that its claim really is

Which in large measure I think is the

17

reason why the Debtors argue that it should be classified as

19

million pro rata with the other general unsecured creditors.

20

It would be precluded by this release from pursuing a claim

21

against Purdue Canada?

THE WITNESS:

23

If the underlying conduct is related

to U.S. opioid-related activities --

24
25

It's in a class, therefore, that's getting $15

THE COURT:

But what if the underlying conduct is

related only to Canadian activities?

Let's assume that if that is the case,

I just want to make sure why is it that the Sacklers need

that release if it's conduct that is just caused by the --

5

of the Canadian company?

MR. JOSEPH:

It has nothing to do with redirect,

7

but just go ahead and say it.

MR. UZZI:

9
10

Your Honor, it's Gerard Uzzi.

I

apologize that I'm interrupting, but it may -- if I could be
helpful in answering that question --

11

THE COURT:

12

MR. UZZI:

Okay.
-- I think there's some confusion.

I

13

think the releasees -- the releases as we've drafted them

14

and what we're looking for is all related to conduct of the

15

Debtor, and as related to conduct of the Debtor.

16

So what the Canadian stipulation did was to

17

clarify the limits of the release.

18

question, to the extent that there is a claim against Purdue

19

Canada that is for Purdue Canada's own conduct, that claim

20

is not being released, Your Honor.

clarification, but I just want to make sure that would

include not just the provinces but also other creditors who

3

only have a claim against Purdue Canada?

4

MR. UZZI:

That is correct, Your Honor, but --

5

MR. GOLD:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

6

that this witness is getting educated by the argument --

7
8

I am concerned

THE COURT:

No, no.

I -- Mr. Gold, there are two

different things going on here.

10

purpose of saying that the release is necessary for the

11

settlement that Side B has entered into.

probe why it is necessary.

13

what is settled, and if he's not the one to know what is

14

settled, then I can certainly hear from the lawyers who

15

drafted it.

16

him, "All right, having that clarified, is it -- in your

17

mind, is it necessary to have that released?"

18

not being released, I don't have to ask him that question.

So I think it's -- so I appreciate the (indiscernible).

sure it was clear to Mr. Underwood, so I just wanted to --

so that's why --

MR. UZZI:

So if I can give you the distinctions,

Your Honor --

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. UZZI:

OKAY.
And then we will deal with this, of

5

course, at closing as to the specific language in the plan

6

and how it relates to many of your questions.

7

There's two types of claims I think we can talk

8

about.

One is the type of claim that you asked about and I

9

just mentioned.

That is Purdue Canada's own conduct.

That

10

is the conduct of Purdue Canada separate and apart from

11

these U.S. Debtors.

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. UZZI:

14

15

In Canada, those -That could be any foreign

(indiscernible).

16
17

MR. UZZI:

Yes.

Yes.

I'm just using Purdue

Canada as the example.

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. UZZI:

Okay.
That's not being released, Your Honor.

20

But to be clear, many of the claims, if not all the claims

21

against Purdue Canada, even being asserted in Canada, are

22

really being asserted as based upon claims of the conduct of

23

Purdue U.S.

24
25

And that's --

THE COURT:

Well, that depends on ultimately how a

Court -- where that comes out as far as the Court decides.

212-267-6868

MR. UZZI:

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. UZZI:

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. UZZI:

Yes.

That's fine.

Yes.
Okay.
Yes.

And so if you read the -- for

7

your benefit, Your Honor, and maybe the benefit of some

8

others, if you understand that and you read the Canadian

9

stipulation against that backdrop, it kind of makes sense

10

why the definition of continuing claims and what the

11

Canadian provinces were looking for were clarification on

12

that point, Your Honor.

13

THE COURT:

All right.

But there's always a

14

concern that when one side -- one party clarifies something,

15

the folks who have not clarified it think, "Oh, well, maybe

16

I'm not in that same boat."

believe, has been actually amended, and there's so much

paper flying around, Your Honor, so I don't know what's been

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I just want to make sure we're on

the same page, but I also want to make clear that in

7

conversations with counsel for the information officer up in

8

Canada in the CCAA proceeding, his understanding is

9

identical, i.e. that it is of concern to the information

10

officer that Canadian claims be preserved against Canadian

assets, and Canadians that are potentially liable will

12

release third parties.

As far as your testimony, Mr. Lynam, in evaluating

the importance, what went into your evaluation on behalf of

the Side B family, of the importance of obtaining a release

relating to the Debtor's sale of non-opioid products or

other activity related to that, such as tax payments or

underpayment of taxes?

Page 238

the release which is being part of a Chapter 11 plan in U.S.

agreement that you would recommend the deal.

11

So, again, you're saying that with these claims carved

out and being permitted to go forward, you still believe

13

that the overall settlement is one that you're approving and

14

authorizing the payments thereunder.

15

A

Yes.

16

Is that correct?

MR. JOSEPH:

I think so, but to be frank, I am

23

confused about the question and I was going to ask Mr. Gold

24

to rephrase it.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

I think you've already answered the

516-608-2400

Page 239

question, frankly.

2

THE WITNESS:

THE COURT:

Okay.
You've analyzed the merits of having a

release of non-U.S. litigation over non-U.S. conduct as

compared to what you believe is released and made that

assessment based on that.

MR. GOLD:

I don't think you need to ask the

No, no.

I appreciate that.

I will

move onto my next question.

10

BY MR. GOLD:

11

Q

12

different question that I gave before, if I understood you

13

correctly, you observed that the Canadian release was in a

14

different category because as a legal matter, there were

15

limitations on whether that release could be compelled by a

16

U.S. Court.

17

A

18

question again?

19

question and I just want to make sure that I understand it.

20

Q

21

relevant factor in assessment the meaningfulness of the

22

Canadian release was that it was -- that there was a

23

question about whether a United States court would have

24

jurisdiction to compel the releases of these Canadian causes

25

of action.

Which is again, to properly understand your answer to a

Is that correct?

What I'd like to do is try to restate your

question, but I still don't understand what you're asking me

11

to answer.

12
13

THE COURT:

I think -- are you trying to set up

another question, Mr. Gold?

14

MR. GOLD:

Well, I was trying to break up my prior

15

question that was objected to into two parts so that it

16

would be less long and objectionable to Mr. Joseph and

17

perhaps others, but so I guess that means my answer to Your

18

Honor's question is yes.

19

THE COURT:

So you're trying to lay a foundation

20

for another question by re-asking the same question you

21

asked before as far as the reason for being willing to carve

22

out releases of non-U.S. -- pertaining to non-U.S. conduct?

23

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, I'm trying to

24

understand his response to it.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Well, he said it.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

He said it just as

516-608-2400

Page 241
1

you've assumed it, I think, which is that because of

2

concerns as to whether a U.S. Court in position of an

3

injunction to pursue claims in a foreign court based on

4

foreign conduct would be enforceable, to carve out -- that's

5

one factor in agreeing to a carve out and making such a

6

release not critical, unlike the release by the ten states

7

or any one of them.

8

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Once again,

9

you've stated it more succinctly and better than I could.

10

would only ask that the witness state that he agrees with

11

what Your Honor just said so that the record is clear.

of questioning is intended to drive at is the fact that the

would he ignore that order?

THE COURT:

I think that's a question for the

yes if it's on account of U.S. claims, but I don't think

Are there others besides the trustee if you have

I -- I am not --

I believe as a trustee we are bound by the trust

No.

Let me then let Mr. Ives sign

Your testimony is concluded, sir, so you can sign off

18

MR. IVES:

19

THE COURT:

Thank you, Your Honor.
All right.

So that does end all the

20

witnesses for today, and we caught up on yesterday's two

21

witnesses.

22

So I guess we resume on Monday.
MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah.

So, Your Honor, let me just

23

help for a second, if I may.

24

remaining witnesses over the weekend.

25

things that we need to figure out with counsel for the

212-267-6868

So we will consult with the

parties over the weekend both to ensure a smooth operation,

have various blackout periods and they can only do, you

4

know, 1:00 to 4:30.

5

up as efficiently as possible.

6

You know, people

And so we'll make sure that's all teed

As the Court surely remembers at the last pretrial

7

conference, we also had some conversations that are not

8

quite resolved yet about where we're going with oral

9

argument and timing for each issue and the like.

We will be

10

in written communication with the parties to try to lock

11

that down.

12

guidance, we will reach a schedule that makes sense because

13

obviously people need to know when they are arguing issues,

14

when they're up, for how long, and the like.

15

be (indiscernible).

16

And I very much hope that based on the Court's

And so we will

We will figure that out.

There is one other issue, Your Honor, that's

17

(indiscernible) lawyer so I'm probably a little bit out of

18

my (indiscernible) here, but the issue about the witnesses

19

that some of the dissenting states, originally I believe on

20

the Maryland end if my memory is right, they may have been

21

joined since then.

22

out also because I think the Court and everybody needs to

23

know, you know, do we have, you know, 12 witnesses left or

24

20 witnesses left.

25

And so that issue needs to be figured

And so I don't know, these are the Debtors'

witnesses, that goes without saying, you know, whether

2

there's anything that either the states or the Sacklers feel

3

they should say about that now or whether we should just

4

caucus over the weekend and see if we can figure things out

5

and narrow things and hopefully come with a much narrower

6

set of (indiscernible) for the Court to resolve.

7

So, you know, in order to get everything organized

8

for next week, I just wanted to put on the table some of the

9

things that I think that we will be doing over the weekend

10

to try to ensure a complete but also efficient trial because

11

many parties' weeks depend upon what's happening next week.

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. JOSEPH:

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. JOSEPH:

So -Your Honor?
Go ahead, Mr. Joseph; that's fine.
I was just going to say we have only

16

two witnesses left, and they'll both be there Monday morning

17

and available for cross.

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

So I'm all for the parties

19

talking over the weekend to clarify who they're calling and

20

what exhibits relate to that testimony.

21

picking up again Monday morning, my clerks and I will need

22

to know who is testifying and the exhibits that people

23

intend to address during their testimony so that I can read

24

the witness declarations and we could be ready with the

25

exhibits.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

But since we're

516-608-2400

Page 279
1

So I think, in other words, it doesn't really help

2

us much to know this at, you know, 11:00 Sunday night.

3

think really we ought to know before then, at least as to

4

the Monday agenda, you know, I would say end of the day

5

Saturday.

6

MR. HUEBNER:

Yep.

Understood, Your Honor.

I

And I

7

think that the early part of next week, sort of the next

8

witnesses are probably not where the complexity comes.

9

THE COURT:

10
11

MR. HUEBNER:

That's fine.
I think it probably starts after

that.

12

THE COURT:

And that's fine.

Wherever you are,

13

you need to give us lead time so that I have reviewed the

14

declarations and know whether I have any questions and able

15

to deal with objections and cross and the like so that, you

16

know, in a way that I can do it.

17

know who's going to be testifying sufficiently in advance

18

and those declarations are teed up so that we can review

19

them.

20

MR. HUEBNER:

And that means letting us

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I

21

understand that whatever side one is on, everyone

22

understands that you're being asked to read literally

23

thousands of pages of paper.

24

so is the least any party to this case can do.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

And giving you 36 hours to do

Okay.

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 280
1

MR. HUEBNER:

So we will be in touch.

Obviously,

2

if I've said something that someone disagrees with about

3

what's open to next week, I trust they'll speak now.

4

Otherwise, we will jump right back into trying to continue

5

to have this be as orderly and agreed as we can all

6

collectively figure out.

7

THE COURT:

8

There are times when I ask questions of people

9

Okay.

All right.

just to see how they will answer them.

I think the parties

10

should take away today, though, that I do have some concerns

11

about the breadth of these releases as articulated not only

12

by me but by Mr. Fogelman and others.

13

that might be a good idea.

14

MR. HUEBNER:

And some focus on

Your Honor, we -- as I hope we

15

always do, we listen very clearly, you know, just to be

16

candid.

17

on the stand and people were musing about things that in

18

fact are not in fact correct with respect to how the

19

releases were in some cases.

20

Debtors are not taxpayers.

21
22

THE COURT:

In others, for example, the

I'm just -- look, there are points

that I think need to be addressed as far as --

23
24

It was an awkward spot because there was a witness

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah, and that's what I was going

to --

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

-- the extent of the releases.

MR. HUEBNER:

I think we understand that there are

2

clearly some reflections from the bench that need to be

3

thought about very carefully and that Your Honor can be

4

quite confident that everybody was listening.

5

be doing a lot of thinking over the weekend.

6

THE COURT:

Okay.

And we will

Now one of my clerks quite

7

cleverly pointed out that as I understand it, although we're

8

picking up 10, the trial actually will follow the

9

uncontested omnibus hearing on Monday morning.

10

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah, there are two -- as a reminder

11

for the Court, there are a total a six pro-se matters, four

12

of which are uncontested, two are contested but I think will

13

be very brief, if my prognostication is correct.

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.
And then there are only the

16

uncontested sort of the examiner-related things that will

17

only take five minutes.

18

might make sense to do only, of course, if it's the Court's

19

pleasure is to just book the commencement of the

20

confirmation hearing for 11:00 and we can let people go --

21

THE COURT:

So for efficiency's sake, what

Well, I'm not sure that's -- look, I

22

think -- check with Mr. Andino on that.

23

better for people to sign on and just be signed on as

24

opposed to having a whole sign-on process at 11:00

25

because --

I think it may be

516-608-2400

MR. HUEBNER:

2

THE COURT:

Sure.
-- that may mean that we're actually

3

starting at 11:30.

4

taking people to sign on.

5

and then send an email around to the parties who are

6

participating in the trial.

7

efficient for everyone to sign on at 10:00 and just realize

8

that the trial actually isn't starting until we get through

9

those relatively simple omnibus matters.

10

I just don't know how long it's been

MR. HUEBNER:

I'd like you to check with him

I think it may be more

And, Your Honor, to be candid about

11

it, one of our issues is that, as the Court well knows, the

12

Debtors are paying the fees of a great many parties in this

13

case.

And an extra hour --

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. HUEBNER:

That's true.
-- of an entire confirmation

16

(indiscernible) listening is in fact possibly in the six

17

figures.

So --

THE COURT:

MR. HUEBNER:

THE COURT:

MR. HUEBNER:

22

All right.
-- we would ask -As long as --- (indiscernible) but please don't

sit here for an hour if these are not (indiscernible).

23

THE COURT:

However we save time is the best.

24

if we save time by having people sign on at 11:00, that's

25

fine.

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

We'll work it out, Your

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

So just check with him because

he knows basically how efficiently people can sign on and I

5

don't.

6

MR. HUEBNER:

7

THE COURT:

Yep.

check your emails as to whether we're starting on the

confirmation hearing at 11:00 or at 10:00.
