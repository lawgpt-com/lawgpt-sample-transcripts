Don: ...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Chandler Bing: Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Don: Excuse me?
Chandler Bing: Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Don: Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
Monica Geller: Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
Don: And you're still married to him?
Monica Geller: You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
Don: Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
Chandler Bing: Is it made of cheese?
Don: No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
Monica Geller: I'd move in tomorrow!
Chandler Bing: Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm so sorry.
Chandler Bing: What do we do?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
