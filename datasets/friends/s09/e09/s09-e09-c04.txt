Monica Geller: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Chandler Bing: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
Monica Geller: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Chandler Bing: All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
Monica Geller: Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
Chandler Bing: Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Monica Geller: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Chandler Bing: I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Monica Geller: Scary pigeon's back?
Chandler Bing: It's huge.
