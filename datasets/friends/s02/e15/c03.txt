Monica Geller: Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Richard Burke: Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Monica Geller: Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Richard Burke: Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
Monica Geller: I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Richard Burke: Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Monica Geller: The head tilt?
Richard Burke: Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
Monica Geller: I'm sorry.
Richard Burke: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Monica Geller: Oh, that's too bad.
Richard Burke: I'll survive.
