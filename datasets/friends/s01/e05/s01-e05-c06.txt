Chandler Bing: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Janice Litman Goralnik: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
