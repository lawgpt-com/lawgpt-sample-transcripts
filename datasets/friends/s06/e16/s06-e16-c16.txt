Chandler Bing: Okay to come in?
Monica Geller: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Chandler Bing: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Monica Geller: What?!
Chandler Bing: I'm the ruptured spleen.
Monica Geller: Why would you do that?
Chandler Bing: Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Monica Geller: Chandler!
Chandler Bing: I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
