Joey Tribbiani: All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Phoebe Buffay: Really?! I won!
Rachel Green: What?!
Ross Geller: I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Rachel Green: Well then I demand a recount!
Ross Geller: Actually, it wasn't that close.
Rachel Green: No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
Phoebe Buffay: The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rachel Green: Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Phoebe Buffay: Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Joey Tribbiani: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Ross Geller: Why-why would I care about that?
