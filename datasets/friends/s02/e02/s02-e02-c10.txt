Chandler Bing: Howdy.
Joey Tribbiani: Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Chandler Bing: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Joey Tribbiani: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Chandler Bing: What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Joey Tribbiani: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Chandler Bing: All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah I guess you're right.
Chandler Bing: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm gonna do it.
Chandler Bing: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
