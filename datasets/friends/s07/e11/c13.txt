Monica Geller: Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Ross Geller: Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Monica Geller: Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Ross Geller: That bitch!
Franny: Monica! What...
Monica Geller: Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Ross Geller: Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Monica Geller: You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Franny: I believe you know my husband.

Ross Geller: So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
