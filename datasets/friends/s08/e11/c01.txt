Rachel Green: nan
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Phoebe Buffay: He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
Rachel Green: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Rachel Green: Really?! So this has happened to you?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Rachel Green: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Rachel Green: Ah.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
