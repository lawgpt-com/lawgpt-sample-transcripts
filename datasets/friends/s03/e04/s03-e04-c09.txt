Phoebe Buffay: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, shoot.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Joey Tribbiani: I didn't get it?
Phoebe Buffay: No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, what else?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Joey Tribbiani: Oh.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Joey Tribbiani: Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, no, I understand.
Joey Tribbiani: You do, thanks.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: Wait a minute.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
Joey Tribbiani: That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
