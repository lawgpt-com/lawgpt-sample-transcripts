Ben Geller: I'm ready!
Ross Geller: You sure?
Ben Geller: Uh-huh!
Chandler Bing: Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Ben Geller: Thanks daddy.
Ross Geller: No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Chandler Bing: Okay. Okay.
Ross Geller: Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Phoebe Buffay: His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Monica Geller: Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: I never had a bike of my own.
Ross Geller: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Chandler Bing: That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Ross Geller: Ohh.
Monica Geller: Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Phoebe Buffay: No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Ross Geller: That is so unfair!
Phoebe Buffay: Not really, I got to drag him around too!
