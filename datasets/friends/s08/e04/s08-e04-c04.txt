Ross Geller: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Ross Geller: Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Joey Tribbiani: Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Ross Geller: I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, for like months?
Ross Geller: Five to be lying, six.
Joey Tribbiani: Six months? Whoa that's rough.
Ross Geller: Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Joey Tribbiani: The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Ross Geller: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
Ross Geller: Really? Well then tell it to me.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
Ross Geller: I'll try to control myself.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe...
Ross Geller: You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Joey Tribbiani: Have a nice six more months Ross!
Ross Geller: Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
Joey Tribbiani: I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying...
Ross Geller: Why?
