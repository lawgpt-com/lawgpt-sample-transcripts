Rachel Green: You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Chandler Bing: Sure...
Rachel Green: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Chandler Bing: I don't know... um, Grease?
Rachel Green: No....
Chandler Bing: Rent?
Rachel Green: Yes! Rent!
Chandler Bing: Okay, so when do you want to go?
Rachel Green: What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Chandler Bing: Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Rachel Green: What did you get her?
Chandler Bing: A pen.
Joey Tribbiani: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Chandler Bing: Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Joey Tribbiani: Why not?
Chandler Bing: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Rachel Green: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Joey Tribbiani: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Chandler Bing: All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Joey Tribbiani: She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Chandler Bing: For three years?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Chandler Bing: All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Chandler Bing: Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Joey Tribbiani: Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
