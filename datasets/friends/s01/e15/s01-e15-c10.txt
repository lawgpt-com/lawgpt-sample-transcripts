Monica Geller: Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Rachel Green: Who was that?
Monica Geller: Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Rachel Green: Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Monica Geller: Ten dollars an hour.
Rachel Green: No.
Monica Geller: Twelve dollars an hour.
Rachel Green: Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Monica Geller: You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Rachel Green: Done.
