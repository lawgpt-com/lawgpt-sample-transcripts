Chandler Bing: What?!
Joey Tribbiani: Why?

Chandler Bing: How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Ross Geller: Who needs a lease when it's family!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
