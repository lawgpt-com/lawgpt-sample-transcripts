Ross Geller: Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Elizabeth Stevens: For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Ross Geller: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Elizabeth Stevens: Wow!
Ross Geller: What?
Elizabeth Stevens: Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
Ross Geller: Really?
Elizabeth Stevens: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Elizabeth Stevens: Stop it!
Ross Geller: No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Elizabeth Stevens: Shut the book!
