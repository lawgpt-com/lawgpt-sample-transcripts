Phoebe Buffay: Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
Ross Geller: Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Phoebe Buffay: I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
Ross Geller: Oh my god, crap from the street?
Phoebe Buffay: Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
Ross Geller: Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Phoebe Buffay: I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
Ross Geller: You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Ross Geller: Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him.
Ross Geller: You're welcome.
