Tag Jones: Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Rachel Green: Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.

Rachel Green: Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Tag Jones: So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Rachel Green: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
