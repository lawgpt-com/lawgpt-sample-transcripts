Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi.
Phoebe Buffay: Are you all right?
Rachel Green: Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! He did it?
Rachel Green: Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Phoebe Buffay: Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Rachel Green: And you really think this is a good idea?
Phoebe Buffay: I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
Rachel Green: I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
Phoebe Buffay: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Rachel Green: Really?! Even Ross?
Phoebe Buffay: Especially Ross!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
Ross Geller: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
Phoebe Buffay: There he goes, your fiance.
Rachel Green: I guess so.
Phoebe Buffay: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Rachel Green: I can't say that I'm surprised.
