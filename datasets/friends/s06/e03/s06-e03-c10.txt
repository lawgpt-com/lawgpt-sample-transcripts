Ross Geller: What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Monica Geller: Ross, we can handle this.
Ross Geller: Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Chandler Bing: Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Ross Geller: Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Chandler Bing: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Monica Geller: Love is the best medicine.
Chandler Bing: That's laughter.
Monica Geller: Why do you do it?
Chandler Bing: I don't know.
Ross Geller: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I do.
Ross Geller: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Monica Geller: Yes.
Ross Geller: Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
