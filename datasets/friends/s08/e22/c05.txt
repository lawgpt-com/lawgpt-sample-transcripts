Phoebe Buffay: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
Rachel Green: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Monica Geller: Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
Phoebe Buffay: It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Monica Geller: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Phoebe Buffay: Fine! You're on!
Monica Geller: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
Ross Geller: Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
Monica Geller: She's in the bathroom.
Ross Geller: Rach, we gotta go.
Rachel Green: In a minute!!!
Ross Geller: People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
Rachel Green: All right, all right. Let's go!
Ross Geller: Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry...
Rachel Green: No, I'm fine.
Ross Geller: Really? You don't think that's a little inappropriate.
Phoebe Buffay: Good God man don't anger it.
Rachel Green: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
Ross Geller: Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Rachel Green: Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
Monica Geller: I'm actually with her on this one.
