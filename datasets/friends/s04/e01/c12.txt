Rachel Green: Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Ross Geller: I missed you too.
Rachel Green: Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Ross Geller: I suppose.
Rachel Green: You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Ross Geller: Umm-hmm.
Rachel Green: Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
