Phoebe Buffay: Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Mike Hannigan: Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
Mike Hannigan: Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
Phoebe Buffay: Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Mike Hannigan: Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
Phoebe Buffay: No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Mike Hannigan: Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
Mike Hannigan: It's gonna be ok.
Phoebe Buffay: You must think I'm crazy.
Mike Hannigan: No, I think you're sweet.
Phoebe Buffay: Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
