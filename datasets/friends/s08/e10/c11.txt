Chandler Bing: Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Monica Geller: Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Chandler Bing: Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Monica Geller: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Chandler Bing: I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Monica Geller: Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
Chandler Bing: I don't have your boots.
Monica Geller: Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
Chandler Bing: Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Monica Geller: Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Chandler Bing: Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Monica Geller: Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Chandler Bing: Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Monica Geller: Okay. All right.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!
