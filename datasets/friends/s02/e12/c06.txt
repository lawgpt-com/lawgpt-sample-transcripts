Erica Ford: Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah it is. . . what?
Erica Ford: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Erica Ford: Who's they?
Joey Tribbiani: No one.
Erica Ford: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Joey Tribbiani: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Erica Ford: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Waiter: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Erica Ford: Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
