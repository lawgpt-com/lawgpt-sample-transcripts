Phoebe Buffay: "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
Rachel Green: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Ja! Ja!
Rachel Green: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Phoebe Buffay: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
Rachel Green: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Phoebe Buffay: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
Rachel Green: Phoebe!!
Phoebe Buffay: You know it's me?
Rachel Green: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Phoebe Buffay: How can you come here?
Rachel Green: How could you not tell me you worked here?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't have to tell you everything!
Rachel Green: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Phoebe Buffay: Tips not included.
Rachel Green: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Phoebe Buffay: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
Rachel Green: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Phoebe Buffay: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
Rachel Green: Good for you Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
