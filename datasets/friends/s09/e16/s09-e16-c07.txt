Mike Hannigan: Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
Mike Hannigan: I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Mike Hannigan: Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
Phoebe Buffay: What do you mean?
Mike Hannigan: Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Wow.
Mike Hannigan: It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
Phoebe Buffay: Was it really that bad?
Mike Hannigan: At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
Mike Hannigan: Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
Phoebe Buffay: But it's just...
Mike Hannigan: Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh!
Mike Hannigan: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
Phoebe Buffay: No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Mike Hannigan: Trust me, I will never...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah I get that.
