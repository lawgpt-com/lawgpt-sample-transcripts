Rachel Green: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Rachel Green: Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Chandler Bing: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Rachel Green: Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Chandler Bing: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Monica Geller: Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Phoebe Buffay: No!
Monica Geller: Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay: No!
Rachel Green: Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Phoebe Buffay: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Chandler Bing: What's the second part of your plan?
Phoebe Buffay: My Saturn dealership.
