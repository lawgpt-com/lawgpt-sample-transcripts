Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Joey Tribbiani: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
Rachel Green: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
Rachel Green: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Rachel Green: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
Joey Tribbiani: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Rachel Green: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Good night!
Rachel Green: Goo--ood night!
Joey Tribbiani: Good night!
Rachel Green: Seriously, good night!
Joey Tribbiani: Stop saying good night.
Rachel Green: Okay.
