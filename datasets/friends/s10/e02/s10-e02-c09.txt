Chandler Bing: Where are Bill and Colleen?
Monica Geller: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Chandler Bing: We have to leave!!
Monica Geller: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Chandler Bing: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Monica Geller: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Colleen: Hey.
Bill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
Colleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Chandler Bing: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Owen: I'm adopted?!
Chandler Bing: See? Intuitive!
Bill: What? Where did you hear that?
Owen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Chandler Bing: Which technically now you should give back!
Colleen: You told him he's adopted?
Chandler Bing: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
Owen: He isn't?!
Chandler Bing: We have to get out of here, baby!
