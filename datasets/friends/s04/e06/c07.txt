Joey Tribbiani: So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Ross Geller: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Ross Geller: What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Ross Geller: No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Joey Tribbiani: What kind of smell?
Ross Geller: I don't know. Soap?
Joey Tribbiani: All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: You wanna see her again, right?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Ross Geller: Yeah, okay you're right.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Ross Geller: I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Ross Geller: It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
Joey Tribbiani: All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
