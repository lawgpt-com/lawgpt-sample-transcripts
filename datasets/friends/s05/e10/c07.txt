Joey Tribbiani: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Chandler Bing: You wanna play?
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Chandler Bing: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.

Chandler Bing: I'm intrigued.

Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Chandler Bing: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh yeah, right here.
