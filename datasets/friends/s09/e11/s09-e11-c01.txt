Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
Chandler Bing: I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Monica Geller: Well, I just lost my erection.
Chandler Bing: I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
Monica Geller: You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Chandler Bing: But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Monica Geller: Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
Chandler Bing: Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Monica Geller: I know!!! My erection is back!
