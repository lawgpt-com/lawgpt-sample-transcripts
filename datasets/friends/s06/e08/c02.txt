Monica Geller: Hey guys.
Chandler Bing: Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Monica Geller: It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Chandler Bing: Ohh, yeah.
Ross Geller: Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Ross Geller: The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Monica Geller: No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Ross Geller: Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Rachel Green: Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Rachel Green: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Rachel?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Rachel Green: Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God. What happened?
Rachel Green: I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Phoebe Buffay: Well that's great! Congratulations!!
Rachel Green: Yeah. A year ago..
Phoebe Buffay: You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Rachel Green: But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Chandler Bing: That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Monica Geller: I don't think mine likes me either.
Ross Geller: Maybe it's a universal thing?
Joey Tribbiani: Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Chandler Bing: Yeah let's head off to work.
Monica Geller: We should go.
