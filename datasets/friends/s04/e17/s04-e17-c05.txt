Alice Knight: Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh! Hi!
Alice Knight: Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yes.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Alice Knight: Three babies?
Frank Buffay Jr.: I finally got my band!
Alice Knight: We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Why would we be freaked?
Phoebe Buffay: No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh.
Alice Knight: Right.
Phoebe Buffay: No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Alice Knight: No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Alice Knight: No, Frank.
Phoebe Buffay: No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah, refrigerator college.
Alice Knight: Yeah.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
Phoebe Buffay: You can't give up on your dream.
Frank Buffay Jr.: No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
