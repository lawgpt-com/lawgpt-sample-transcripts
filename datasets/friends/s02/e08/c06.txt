Ross Geller: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Chandler Bing: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Chandler Bing: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Joey Tribbiani: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Chandler Bing: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Ross Geller: Can't we just use a pen?
Chandler Bing: No, Amish boy.
Joey Tribbiani: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Ross Geller: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Joey Tribbiani: You could say that.
Ross Geller: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Chandler Bing: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Ross Geller: I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Chandler Bing: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Ross Geller: She's not Rachel.
