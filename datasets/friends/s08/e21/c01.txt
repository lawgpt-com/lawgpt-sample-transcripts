Ross Geller: Hey you guys I got some bad news.
Phoebe Buffay: Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Ross Geller: No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
Joey Tribbiani: Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Ross Geller: Umm...
Monica Geller: Oh dear God!
Ross Geller: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Monica Geller: What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Ross Geller: Yeah, they all know.
Monica Geller: Oh my God, this is horrible!
Chandler Bing: I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller: I'm so humiliated!
Rachel Green: Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
Monica Geller: You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
Rachel Green: I didn't write it.
Monica Geller: Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
#ALL#: No!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
