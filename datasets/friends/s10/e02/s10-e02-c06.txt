Monica Geller: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Colleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Bill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Chandler Bing: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
Chandler Bing: I mean, you have a lovely home.
Monica Geller: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Colleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.
Colleen: It's pretty much all the information you need.
Monica Geller: Oh my god!
Colleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Monica Geller: Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Bill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
Chandler Bing: That's great. Can I see the book?
Chandler Bing: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Monica Geller: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Colleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
Colleen: I would have told him to do it too.
Monica Geller: Can I adopt you?
Chandler Bing: Hey, you must be Owen.
Owen: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Owen: You were?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Owen: Huh?
Chandler Bing: You know how to use a compass?
Owen: I have a badge in it.
Chandler Bing: You do? That's fantastic!
Owen: You wanna see it?
Chandler Bing: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
Owen: What?!?
Chandler Bing: What?
Owen: I'm adopted?
Chandler Bing: I got nothing.
