Janice Litman Goralnik: I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies!
Ross Geller: Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
Man: Hi sweetie!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
Sid Goralnik: I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
Ross Geller: Really?
Sid Goralnik: What'd he say?
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh y'know what? You have to speak very loudly when you're talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf.
Rachel Green: Oh!
Ross Geller: Oh there you go!
Rachel Green: I get it!
Janice Litman Goralnik: So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
Rachel Green: Oh we-we didn't.

Janice Litman Goralnik: Why?!!
Ross Geller: Uh well umm...we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh. Well then shut me up.
Rachel Green: Just tell me how.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Ross Geller: Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
