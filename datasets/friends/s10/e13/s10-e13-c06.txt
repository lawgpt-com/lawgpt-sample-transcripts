Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Ross Geller: I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Rachel Green: Uh. Did you call your parents?
Ross Geller: Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Rachel Green: Oh good.
Ross Geller: Wow.
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel Green: What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Ross Geller: Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel Green: Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Ross Geller: Sorry. . You ok?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Ross Geller: You had a rough day, uh?
Rachel Green: Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Ross Geller: But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Rachel Green: Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Ross Geller: What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Rachel Green: Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Ross Geller: No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Rachel Green: Ok, maybe you're right.
Ross Geller: Good night.
Rachel Green: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Ross Geller: Sure!
Rachel Green: Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Ross Geller: Oh, of course...
Rachel Green: Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Ross Geller: Me too. Come here.
Rachel Green: I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Ross Geller: Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Rachel Green: Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Ross Geller: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Rachel Green: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Ross Geller: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Rachel Green: Wow. Ok.
Ross Geller: I'll see you in the morning .
Rachel Green: Mhm-mh!
Ross Geller: Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
