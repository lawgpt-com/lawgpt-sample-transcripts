Ross Geller: Hey!
Carol Willick: Hey! How's Ben?
Ross Geller: Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Carol Willick: Hey, Ben! Hey!
Ross Geller: So umm, any word from Susan?
Carol Willick: Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Ross Geller: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Carol Willick: What's too much fun?
Ross Geller: Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Carol Willick: Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Ross Geller: Am I?!
Carol Willick: Yes!
Ross Geller: Am I?!
Carol Willick: I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Ross Geller: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Carol Willick: Maybe.
Ross Geller: OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
