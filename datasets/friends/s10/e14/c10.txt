Monica Geller: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Chandler Bing: Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Monica Geller: Hey, where have you been?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Chandler Bing: Really? What changed your mind?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Chandler Bing: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey Tribbiani: That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Monica Geller: Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
Joey Tribbiani: What? I get my own room?
Chandler Bing: You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Chandler Bing: No!
Joey Tribbiani: Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
