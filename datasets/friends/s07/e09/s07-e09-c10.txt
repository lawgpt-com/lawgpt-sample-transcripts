Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hello liar.
Ross Geller: Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Phoebe Buffay: I could've been killed I hope you know!
Ross Geller: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Ross Geller: Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: What?! What the hell?!
Ross Geller: All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
Phoebe Buffay: What?! Why?!
Ross Geller: Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Ross Geller: Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay Ross! Please don't die!
