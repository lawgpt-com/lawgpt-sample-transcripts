Monica Geller: Alright. My job here is done.
Chandler Bing: That was... Impressive.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Monica Geller: Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Chandler Bing: Sorry about the table, man.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: You gonna buy a new one?
Joey Tribbiani: Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Chandler Bing: Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
Joey Tribbiani: I could get a goose!
Chandler Bing: You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Chandler Bing: I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
