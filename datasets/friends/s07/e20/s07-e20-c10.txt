Ross Geller: Hey!
Monica Geller: You just carry that around?
Ross Geller: Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Monica Geller: Between you and...
Ross Geller: Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Chandler Bing: I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Monica Geller: A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Ross Geller: Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Chandler Bing: Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Ross Geller: What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Chandler Bing: Let me try it on!
Ross Geller: Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Chandler Bing: Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Ross Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Ross Geller: Let me see that! Oh man!
Chandler Bing: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica Geller: All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Joey Tribbiani: No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Monica Geller: Oh.
Chandler Bing: Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
