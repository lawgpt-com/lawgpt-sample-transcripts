Phoebe Buffay: Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Monica Geller: And I would have to say pah-huh.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Monica Geller: Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Rachel Green: Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Monica Geller: And his puppet too.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Monica Geller: Who?
Phoebe Buffay: Paul.
Monica Geller: Oh.
Rachel Green: Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Monica Geller: Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Rachel Green: Not uh, not to my recollection.
Monica Geller: Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Rachel Green: Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Rachel Green: Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Monica Geller: One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
