Ross Geller: So? What do you think?
Joey Tribbiani: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Ross Geller: Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.

Joey Tribbiani: Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross Geller: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
