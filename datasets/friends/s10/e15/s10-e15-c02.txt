Monica Geller: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Chandler Bing: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Monica Geller: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Chandler Bing: What do you think Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: She died.
Chandler Bing: You're kidding!
Monica Geller: That's terrible!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, she was just an agent.
Monica Geller: Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Chandler Bing: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Monica Geller: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
Monica Geller: What if he reads it in the paper?
Chandler Bing: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
