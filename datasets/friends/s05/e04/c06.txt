Ross Geller: Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.

Ross Geller: All right, did you just say all right?
Emily Waltham: I did. Now I'm the idiot.

Emily Waltham: All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Ross Geller: Oh that is so great! That's...
Emily Waltham: As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
