Roy: What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
Phoebe Buffay: You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Roy: No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
Rachel Green: No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Roy: I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel Green: So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe Buffay: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
Roy: You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
Phoebe Buffay: There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Roy: Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Phoebe Buffay: Finish it!
Roy: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Your last dance. Do it for us.
Roy: Really?
Rachel Green: Really?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Roy: Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Roy: Have to...
