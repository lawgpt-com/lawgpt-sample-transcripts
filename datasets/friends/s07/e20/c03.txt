Rachel Green: So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Chandler Bing: Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Rachel Green: I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Chandler Bing: Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Rachel Green: Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Chandler Bing: You mean like for award shows?
Rachel Green: Some of them.
Chandler Bing: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Rachel Green: Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Chandler Bing: Okay, who wore those?
Rachel Green: Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Chandler Bing: Not bad.
Rachel Green: This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Chandler Bing: Who's that?
Rachel Green: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Chandler Bing: Pierce Brosnan?
Rachel Green: Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing: Are you serious?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: 007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Rachel Green: It's a pretty cool tux.
Chandler Bing: Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
