Kim: Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Rachel Green: Oh great!
Kim: So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Nancy: Oh, sorry!
Rachel Green: Oh that's okay.
Kim: No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Nancy: So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Kim: Oh that's great! You are the best!

Rachel Green: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Nancy: I thought you didn't smoke.
Rachel Green: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Kim: We get high.
Rachel Green: Oh, me too.
Kim: I'm kidding.
Rachel Green: Oh, me too.
