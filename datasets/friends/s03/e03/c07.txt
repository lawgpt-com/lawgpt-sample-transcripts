Malcom: Here's my binoculars.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Malcom: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yeah. What's this?
Malcom: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, not even a little bit.
Malcom: It's about you.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay then.
Malcom: I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Phoebe Buffay: Good. So what were you thinking?
Malcom: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Phoebe Buffay: Really?
Malcom: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Malcom: See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay.
