Ross Geller: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Joey Tribbiani: Right. No big deal.
Ross Geller: Okay.

Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Chandler Bing: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Ross Geller: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Joey Tribbiani: Ross, how could you let this happen?

Joey Tribbiani: You don't think my mom's sexy?
Ross Geller: Well... not in the same way...
Joey Tribbiani: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Ross Geller: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
