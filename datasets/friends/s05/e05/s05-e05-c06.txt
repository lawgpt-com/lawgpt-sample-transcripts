Rachel Green: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Rachel Green: Okay, what's up?
Ross Geller: Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Rachel Green: Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Ross Geller: And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Rachel Green: Yeah?
Ross Geller: ...is for me not to see you anymore.
Rachel Green: That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Ross Geller: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Rachel Green: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
Ross Geller: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Ross Geller: What are you doing?
Rachel Green: Storming out!
Ross Geller: Rachel, this is your apartment.
Rachel Green: Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
