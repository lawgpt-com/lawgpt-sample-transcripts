Phoebe Buffay: Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Phoebe Buffay: No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
Phoebe Buffay: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.
Joey Tribbiani: Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
Joey Tribbiani: You blow me away.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
Joey Tribbiani: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
