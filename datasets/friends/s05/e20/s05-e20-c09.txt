Gary: Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Phoebe Buffay: John Glenn is here?!
Gary: No, Joey!
Ross Geller: Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Gary: Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Gary: Okay, go ahead.
Ross Geller: Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Phoebe Buffay: My God, Joey!
Chandler Bing: It was a car backfire!
Ross Geller: Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I didn't know that.
Ross Geller: And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Gary: Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Chandler Bing: Who jumps at loud noises!
Ross Geller: Wow! I could've died tonight.
Chandler Bing: Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Ross Geller: I do have a newfound respect for life.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!
Gary: So you wanna get some dinner?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Gary: Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay!
Gary: All right.
Phoebe Buffay: Bye!
Joey Tribbiani: Bye!
