Monica Geller: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Ross Geller: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Monica Geller: Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler Bing: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Phoebe Buffay: Thank you.
Ross Geller: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Rachel Green: Wait, are you leaving?
Ross Geller: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Rachel Green: Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Ross Geller: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Chandler Bing: That's ok.
Ross Geller: What's goin' on?
Rachel Green: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Ross Geller: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Rachel Green: No. No-no-no-no.
Ross Geller: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Rachel Green: Really?
Ross Geller: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Rachel Green: No, I think that was the whole all.
Ross Geller: Okay. Okay. Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
