Chandler Bing: Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?

Chandler Bing: Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, you're on.
Chandler Bing: Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
