Monica Geller: Hi.
Chandler Bing: Are you, are you high?
Monica Geller: I just had the most amazing bath.
Chandler Bing: Really? I don't like baths.
Monica Geller: Wait, you like them with me.
Chandler Bing: Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
Monica Geller: Oh, baths are so relaxing!
Chandler Bing: Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Monica Geller: How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Chandler Bing: Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Chandler Bing: Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, neither.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God, what's up?!
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
Chandler Bing: Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
Joey Tribbiani: All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
Chandler Bing: Do you?
Joey Tribbiani: It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
Chandler Bing: In London?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
Joey Tribbiani: You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
Chandler Bing: If that.
