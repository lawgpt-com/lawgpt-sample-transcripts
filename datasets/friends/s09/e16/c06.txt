Chandler Bing: Hey Joe!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Joey Tribbiani: I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Chandler Bing: And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I know.
Chandler Bing: What? What do you mean you know?
Joey Tribbiani: Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Chandler Bing: Oh! Right.
Joey Tribbiani: That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Chandler Bing: Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Chandler Bing: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Joey Tribbiani: Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Chandler Bing: Oh ok.
Joey Tribbiani: I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
Joey Tribbiani: Err... Kind of.
Chandler Bing: I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Something personal.
Chandler Bing: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Woman: Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani: Boob job.
Monica Geller: I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Joey Tribbiani: Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
