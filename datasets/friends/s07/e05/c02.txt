Rachel Green: Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Ross Geller: Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Chandler Bing: Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Rachel Green: Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Phoebe Buffay: He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
Ross Geller: It's not a club.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Ross Geller: Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Chandler Bing: They have that on the napkins at the club.
Rachel Green: Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Phoebe Buffay: You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Rachel Green: Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Chandler Bing: Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Rachel Green: Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Ross Geller: Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Rachel Green: I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Phoebe Buffay: So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Rachel Green: Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Ross Geller: Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Chandler Bing: Dude that is so sad.
Ross Geller: I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Chandler Bing: Could I play?
