Rachel Green: Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Chandler Bing: Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Rachel Green: No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Chandler Bing: What about him?
Rachel Green: I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Phoebe Buffay: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Rachel Green: Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Phoebe Buffay: Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Rachel Green: Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Chandler Bing: Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
