Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
The Vendor: So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Joey Tribbiani: Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Chandler Bing: Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I like it. Here you go.
Chandler Bing: All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I embarrass you?
Chandler Bing: How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
The Vendor: He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Chandler Bing: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
The Vendor: They're all tourists.
Chandler Bing: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
The Vendor: Good choice.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks.
Chandler Bing: Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
