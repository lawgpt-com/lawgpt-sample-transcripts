Joey Tribbiani: All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Ross Geller: The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Ross Geller: It's okay, I'm ready.
Joey Tribbiani: No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.

Ross Geller: Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
Chandler Bing: Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
Joey Tribbiani: All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.

Ross Geller: You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...
Chandler Bing: I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
