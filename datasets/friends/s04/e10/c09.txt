Monica Geller: What the hell happened?!
Joey Tribbiani: I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Monica Geller: Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Joey Tribbiani: And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Monica Geller: What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey Tribbiani: Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
