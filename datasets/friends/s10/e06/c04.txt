Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Monica Geller: Oh, right.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Monica Geller: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Phoebe Buffay: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Monica Geller: Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Monica Geller: Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Phoebe Buffay: Why, you don't like her?
Monica Geller: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Phoebe Buffay: Really? You think?
Monica Geller: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Monica Geller: Damn it, I did not think this through!
