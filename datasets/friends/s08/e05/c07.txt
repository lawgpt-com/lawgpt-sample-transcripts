Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
Phoebe Buffay: But...
Monica Geller: No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
Monica Geller: Why not?!
Phoebe Buffay: Because I'm dumping him today.
Monica Geller: What?! You said he was sweet!
Phoebe Buffay: He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
Monica Geller: Just don't pick up your phone.
Phoebe Buffay: Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
Monica Geller: What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
Phoebe Buffay: You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
Monica Geller: Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Phoebe Buffay: Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
Monica Geller: Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
Monica Geller: What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay: Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
Monica Geller: I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
