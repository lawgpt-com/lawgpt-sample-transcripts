Ross Geller: Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Rachel Green: Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Monica Geller: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Phoebe Buffay: Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Monica Geller: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.

Joey Tribbiani: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
#ALL#: Oh, I got it.

Guy: Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, thank you.
