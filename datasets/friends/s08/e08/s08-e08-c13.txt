Ross Geller: Thank you so much for coming back over.
Mona: Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
Rachel Green: I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Ross Geller: Focus.
Rachel Green: Okay. Um...But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Mona: How can I be sure on that?
Rachel Green: Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Ross Geller: Trying to date this woman.
Rachel Green: Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Ross Geller: Probably shouldn't touch me.
Mona: Y'know, I-I-I just...I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
Rachel Green: I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.
Ross Geller: Should I leave this open for you too?
Mona: I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
Ross Geller: Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Mona: Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
Ross Geller: I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
Mona: Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
Rachel Green: Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
