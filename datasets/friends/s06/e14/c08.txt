Ross Geller: You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Jill Green: Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Ross Geller: Of course, what happened?
Jill Green: I don't want to talk about it.
Ross Geller: Okay, umm...
Jill Green: But you know what might really cheer me up?
Ross Geller: What?
Jill Green: Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Ross Geller: Wow! Really?!
Jill Green: Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Ross Geller: Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Jill Green: Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Ross Geller: Ohh!
