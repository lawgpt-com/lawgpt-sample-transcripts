Phoebe Buffay: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
Frank Buffay Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!
Phoebe Buffay: That's a, that's a long time.
Frank Buffay Jr.: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Frank Buffay Jr.: No, I can't.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
Phoebe Buffay: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
