Joey Tribbiani: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
Rachel Green: We weren't doing anything!
Joey Tribbiani: Rach, he just saw us.
Rachel Green: Shhh.
Joey Tribbiani: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Rachel Green: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Rachel Green: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
Rachel Green: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, but it did happen, so...
Joey Tribbiani: Ross?
Rachel Green: Ross? Can we just close the door?
