Chandler Bing: Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Joey Tribbiani: But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Chandler Bing: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Scott Alexander: Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Chandler Bing: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Scott Alexander: No kidding.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Scott Alexander: Where do you work?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Chandler Bing: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Scott Alexander: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Joey Tribbiani: Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
