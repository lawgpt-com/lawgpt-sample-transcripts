Mr. Treeger: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
Mr. Treeger: You want me to kick you guys out instead?
Joey Tribbiani: No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Mr. Treeger: You have pets!
Joey Tribbiani: Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Mr. Treeger: Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Mr. Treeger: Really? You'll do anything?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Mr. Treeger: Yeah, I've got something you can do.
Joey Tribbiani: What, what is it?
Mr. Treeger: Can you be my dancing partner?
Joey Tribbiani: That's not, prison lingo, is it?
