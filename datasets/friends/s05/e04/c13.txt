Rachel Green: Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Ross Geller: For what?
Rachel Green: For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Rachel Green: Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Ross Geller: It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Rachel Green: Like what?
Ross Geller: Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Rachel Green: Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Ross Geller: No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Rachel Green: Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Ross Geller: Thanks.
Rachel Green: Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ross Geller: Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
