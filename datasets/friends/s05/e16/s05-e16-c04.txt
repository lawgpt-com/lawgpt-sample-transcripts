Rachel Green: Ugh!
Ross Geller: Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Rachel Green: What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ross Geller: No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Rachel Green: Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
The Salesman: You picked a great couch.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
The Salesman: Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Ross Geller: Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Rachel Green: Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Ross Geller: Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Rachel Green: Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Ross Geller: Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Rachel Green: Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
The Salesman: You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Ross Geller: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
The Salesman: Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Rachel Green: Ross!
Ross Geller: What's that supposed to mean?
Rachel Green: Ross!
The Salesman: Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Ross Geller: Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
The Salesman: Really? You two?
Ross Geller: Yeah! Rach?
Rachel Green: Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Ross Geller: Then tell him quickly.
Rachel Green: Fine! We went out.
Ross Geller: Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Rachel Green: Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Ross Geller: A loser you did it with 298 times!
