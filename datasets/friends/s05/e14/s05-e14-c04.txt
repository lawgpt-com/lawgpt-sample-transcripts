Monica Geller: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Chandler Bing: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Monica Geller: Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Chandler Bing: Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Monica Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Monica Geller: What are you talking about?
Chandler Bing: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Monica Geller: That's not possible!
Chandler Bing: Ow!
Monica Geller: I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Chandler Bing: Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Monica Geller: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Chandler Bing: No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
