Joey Tribbiani: Come on, they're close.
Monica Geller: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

Joey Tribbiani: Ow!
Monica Geller: I'm outta here.
Joey Tribbiani: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.

Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
