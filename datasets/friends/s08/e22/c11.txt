Ross Geller: Come on, finish your enchilada.
Rachel Green: Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Ross Geller: Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha... Oh God! So...so hot! Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
Rachel Green: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Ross Geller: Stop it.
Rachel Green: Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
Ross Geller: I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
Rachel Green: Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
Ross Geller: This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
Rachel Green: Make love? What are you a girl?
Ross Geller: Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
Rachel Green: But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
Ross Geller: I love when you talk dirty to me.
Rachel Green: Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh...Oh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!
Ross Geller: Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Rachel Green: Come on Ross! I'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
Ross Geller: Y'know what?
Rachel Green: What?!
Ross Geller: Forget it.
Rachel Green: Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!
Ross Geller: I'm getting that baby out of you!
