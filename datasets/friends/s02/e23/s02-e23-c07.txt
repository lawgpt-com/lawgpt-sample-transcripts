Ryan: You're scratching. Give me the dice.
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Ryan: Give me the dice.
Phoebe Buffay: No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Ryan: We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Phoebe Buffay: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Ryan: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Give it.
Ryan: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
