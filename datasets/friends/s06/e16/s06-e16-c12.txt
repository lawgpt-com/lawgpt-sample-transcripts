Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Monica Geller: Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Chandler Bing: So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Monica Geller: Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Chandler Bing: Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Monica Geller: Are you okay?
Chandler Bing: Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Monica Geller: Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Chandler Bing: I bet he can.
Monica Geller: Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
