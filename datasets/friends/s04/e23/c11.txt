Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi.
Phoebe Buffay: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Rachel Green: Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Rachel Green: You can?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Rachel Green: Um-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay: And a small piece of chocolate.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: And a glass of tepid water.
Rachel Green: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Rachel Green: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Rachel Green: I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay?
Rachel Green: All right.
Phoebe Buffay: So uh, now look at the picture...
Rachel Green: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, and umm...
Rachel Green: Ow!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, how do you feel now?
Rachel Green: Well, I like you less!
