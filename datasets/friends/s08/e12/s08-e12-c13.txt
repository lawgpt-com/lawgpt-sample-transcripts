Joey's Date: Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?
Joey's Date: You mean like from behind?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
Joey's Date: Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Joey's Date: Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
