Chandler Bing: Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Phoebe Buffay: No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Chandler Bing: I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Ross Geller: Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Chandler Bing: NO!!!
Rachel Green: All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Monica Geller: What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Rachel Green: Come on!
Ross Geller: What happened? Joey?
Joey Tribbiani: All right.
Monica Geller: No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
Chandler Bing: They'll never understand!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Monica Geller: All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Chandler Bing: We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Monica Geller: I was in too much pain.
Joey Tribbiani: And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Chandler Bing: And then Joey remembered something.
Joey Tribbiani: I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ross Geller: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Phoebe Buffay: Ewwww!!
Monica Geller: You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Phoebe Buffay: Ewwww!!
Joey Tribbiani: That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
Chandler Bing: Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Joey Tribbiani: That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
