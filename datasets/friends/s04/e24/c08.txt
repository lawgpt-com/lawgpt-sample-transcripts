Jack Geller: There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Ross Geller: Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Jack Geller: All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
