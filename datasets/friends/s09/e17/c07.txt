Joey Tribbiani: Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
Rachel Green: Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
Rachel Green: Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Rachel Green: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
Joey Tribbiani: Make the transfer!
Rachel Green: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
Rachel Green: Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Joey Tribbiani: But he's the same.
Rachel Green: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Joey Tribbiani: But he's the same.
Rachel Green: Joey, come on!
Joey Tribbiani: He's the same! .
Joey Tribbiani: You're not the same!
