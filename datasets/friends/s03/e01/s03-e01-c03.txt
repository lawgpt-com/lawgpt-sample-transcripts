Chandler Bing: Morning.
Joey Tribbiani: Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Good morning.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Chandler Bing: I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Janice Litman Goralnik: I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Chandler Bing: Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Joey Tribbiani: Kiss her! Kiss her!
Janice Litman Goralnik: I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Chandler Bing: Nope, not this time.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on, quite yankin' me.
Chandler Bing: I'm not yanking you.
Joey Tribbiani: This is Janice.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Chandler Bing: I'm not breaking up with her!
