Phoebe's Assistant: We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, thanks.
Phoebe's Assistant: Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
Paolo: Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!

Paolo: Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, Racquela's right, yeah!

Phoebe Buffay: Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
