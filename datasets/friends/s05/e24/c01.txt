Phoebe Buffay: Kills you?
Ross Geller: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohhh!
Ross Geller: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay: How do you know about this?

Ross Geller: What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
