Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey!
Ross Geller: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Rachel Green: No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Ross Geller: I don't know if it's true.
Rachel Green: Oh b-b-but it is!
Ross Geller: Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Rachel Green: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Ross Geller: All right. All right, I'll do it.
Rachel Green: Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
