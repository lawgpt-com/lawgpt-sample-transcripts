Rachel Green: What were you thinking?!
Joey Tribbiani: I didn't know it was an auction!
Rachel Green: Wh?!
Joey Tribbiani: I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Rachel Green: Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know! Charity?
Rachel Green: Ugh!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, just buy the damn boat!
Rachel Green: Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm just helping the kids!
Rachel Green: How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe Buffay: Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Thompson: Mr. Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh hi!
Mr. Thompson: Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Joey Tribbiani: Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Mr. Thompson: I think it was valued at 19,000
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.

Joey Tribbiani: So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Rachel Green: Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Rachel Green: I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Rachel Green: Not great.
