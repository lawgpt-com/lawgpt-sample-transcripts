Monica Geller: Oh! You're awake!
Phoebe Buffay: Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Coma Guy: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Monica Geller: You look good!
Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica Geller: Oh, sorry.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Monica Geller: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, we both have.
Coma Guy: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, actually it's just from me.
Monica Geller: I got you the foot massager.
Phoebe Buffay: You know who shaved you? That was me.
Monica Geller: I read to you.
Phoebe Buffay: I sang. Hah!
Coma Guy: Well,... thanks.
Monica Geller: Oh, my pleasure.
Phoebe Buffay: You're welcome.
Coma Guy: So. I guess I'll see you around.
Phoebe Buffay: What, that's it?
Monica Geller: "See you around?"
Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?
Monica Geller: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Coma Guy: Alright, I'll call you.
Phoebe Buffay: I don't think you mean that.
Monica Geller: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
