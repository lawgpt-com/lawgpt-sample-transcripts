Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: I've got good news!
Monica Geller: You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Chandler Bing: Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
Monica Geller: It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.
Monica Geller: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
Monica Geller: No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Chandler Bing: Really?
Monica Geller: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Chandler Bing: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Monica Geller: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you said that without gagging!
Monica Geller: I know!
