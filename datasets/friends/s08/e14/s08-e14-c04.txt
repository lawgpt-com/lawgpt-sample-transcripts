Ross Geller: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
Ross Geller: What?! It is?!
Rachel Green: It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
Ross Geller: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Rachel Green: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
Joey Tribbiani: A dreamless sleep.
Ross Geller: My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I...kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
Joey Tribbiani: Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Ross Geller: Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
