Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
Rachel Green: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Phoebe Buffay: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh... then I overpaid.
Monica Geller: Hey, what's this?
Rachel Green: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Monica Geller: Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Rachel Green: Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
Monica Geller: Do you wanna go hunting?
Rachel Green: Well, I would like to have the option!!
Phoebe Buffay: What's up? Hey, Rachel!!
Rachel Green: Oh!
Phoebe Buffay: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Monica Geller: And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Rachel Green: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
Rachel Green: I don't care about any of that!!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, do you care about friendship?
Rachel Green: Oh!
Phoebe Buffay: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Rachel Green: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Phoebe Buffay: Promise?
Rachel Green: I promise.
Phoebe Buffay: Thank you.
Rachel Green: But I am going hunting!!
