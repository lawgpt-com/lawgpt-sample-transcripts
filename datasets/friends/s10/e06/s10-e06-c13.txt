Rachel Green: O-oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Rachel Green: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Joey Tribbiani: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Rachel Green: Joey, we're not keeping this!
Joey Tribbiani: But it's an original Buffay...
Rachel Green: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Rachel Green: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Rachel Green: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
Joey Tribbiani: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Monica Geller: Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Rachel Green: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
Monica Geller: No, too late. You can't give it back!
Rachel Green: Yes I can!
Monica Geller: No you can't. She's yours!
Rachel Green: She's yours!
Monica Geller: SHE'S YOURS!
Rachel Green: She's yours!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: She's mine!
Monica Geller: She's m-i-i-ne!
Rachel Green: She's mine!
Monica Geller: She's mine!
Phoebe Buffay: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
Rachel Green: I want Gladys!
Monica Geller: She's mine!
Rachel Green: She's mine!
Monica Geller: She's mine!
Rachel Green: She's mine!
