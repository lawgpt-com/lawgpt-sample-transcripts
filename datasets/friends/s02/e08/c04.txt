Mr. Ratstatter: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Monica Geller: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Mr. Ratstatter: Mockolate.
Monica Geller: I'm sorry?
Mr. Ratstatter: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Monica Geller: Ohh.
Mr. Ratstatter: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Monica Geller: All right. Mmm-mmm.
Mr. Ratstatter: Yeah?
Monica Geller: I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Mr. Ratstatter: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Monica Geller: Mmm-mmm.
Mr. Ratstatter: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Monica Geller: Wow.
Mr. Ratstatter: Aren't you going to swallow that?
Monica Geller: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Mr. Ratstatter: Yeah, isn't that great?
Monica Geller: Mmm.
Mr. Ratstatter: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Monica Geller: Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Mr. Ratstatter: Really?
Monica Geller: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
