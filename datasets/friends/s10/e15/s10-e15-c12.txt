Rachel Green: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Ross Geller: They did?
Rachel Green: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
Ross Geller: So, what are you gonna do?
Rachel Green: Well, I took it.
Ross Geller: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Both: YAY! WHOO! YAY!
Ross Geller: You're excited, right?
Rachel Green: Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
Ross Geller: Right!
Rachel Green: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Ross Geller: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Rachel Green: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
Ross Geller: You should go.
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: It's what you want. You should go.
Rachel Green: You really think so?
Ross Geller: I really do.
Rachel Green: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Ross Geller: I'm sure he'll understand.
Rachel Green: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Ross Geller: Yeah...
Rachel Green: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Ross Geller: Yeah, yeah, oh!
Rachel Green: Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Ross Geller: Then I'm happy too.
