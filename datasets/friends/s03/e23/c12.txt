Guru Saj: You must be Ross.
Ross Geller: Hi.
Guru Saj: I am Guru Saj.
Ross Geller: Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Guru Saj: Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
Ross Geller: What's a koondis?
Guru Saj: I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Ross Geller: I guess it's worth a try.
Guru Saj: Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
Ross Geller: What?! What?!
Guru Saj: We appear to have angered it.
Ross Geller: We?! We angered it?!
Guru Saj: Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
Ross Geller: Oh God!
Guru Saj: Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...

Ross Geller: What was, what was that?
Guru Saj: Well it's gone.
Ross Geller: What?! How's that?
Guru Saj: It got caught on my watch.
Ross Geller: Hey!
