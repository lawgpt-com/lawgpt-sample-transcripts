Ross Geller: Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Joey Tribbiani: Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Ross Geller: Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
Rachel Green: They made you head of the department!
Ross Geller: No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didn't I get head of the department?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm...
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Rachel Green: Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, great! Thanks!
Rachel Green: Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!
Joey Tribbiani: You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya...
Rachel Green: Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, y'know what?
Rachel Green: Huh?
Joey Tribbiani: Why don't I take you out?
Rachel Green: What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Joey Tribbiani: Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out...
Rachel Green: Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
Joey Tribbiani: I'll be fun.
Rachel Green: All right?
