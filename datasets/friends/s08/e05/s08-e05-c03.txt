Joey's Co-Star: Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: What is it?
Joey's Co-Star: Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: Is it serious?
Joey's Co-Star: Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
Joey's Co-Star: We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body, it was gone.

Director: Cut! Very nice people!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
Rachel Green: Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
Joey Tribbiani: I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
Rachel Green: You don't know do you?
Joey Tribbiani: No, couldn't care less.
Joey's Co-Star: Hey good scene man.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey you too!
Joey's Co-Star: Alright.

Joey Tribbiani: What? You weren't in it.
Rachel Green: Oh!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Kash: Yes?
Joey Tribbiani: This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
Rachel Green: Hi.
Kash: Hey! How come I haven't seen you here before?
Rachel Green: Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
Joey Tribbiani: Here we go! Here we go!
Rachel Green: Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
Kash: Bye.
Rachel Green: Say hi to Wally.
