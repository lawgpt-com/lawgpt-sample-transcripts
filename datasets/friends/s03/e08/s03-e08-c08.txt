Ross Geller: What'd you do, take him whaling?
Ben Geller: Monica.
Ross Geller: Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Ben Geller: Monica bang!

Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Rachel Green: Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Monica Geller: All right, we should call somebody.

Rachel Green: Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Monica Geller: How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
