Joey Tribbiani: So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Monica Geller: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Chandler Bing: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Monica Geller: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Joey Tribbiani: Ohh, I love birds.
Chandler Bing: What is the matter with you ?!?
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Chandler Bing: You're turning into a women.
Joey Tribbiani: No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Chandler Bing: Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Joey Tribbiani: It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
