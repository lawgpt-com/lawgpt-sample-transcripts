Chandler Bing: Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Ross Geller: uhu uhu, check this out.
Chandler Bing: Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Ross Geller: Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Chandler Bing: No, come on, you know that's not true.
Ross Geller: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Chandler Bing: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Ross Geller: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Chandler Bing: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Ross Geller: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Chandler Bing: Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Ross Geller: Exactly!!
Chandler Bing: Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Ross Geller: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Chandler Bing: Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Ross Geller: oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
