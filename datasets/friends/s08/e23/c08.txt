Monica Geller: What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Chandler Bing: I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
Monica Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
Monica Geller: We are pretty good.
Chandler Bing: But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Monica Geller: Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
Chandler Bing: What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Monica Geller: What?!!
Chandler Bing: I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Monica Geller: So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Chandler Bing: We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Monica Geller: Okay, hold on a sec.
Chandler Bing: Period math?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Well, we could start trying. Now.
Chandler Bing: Right here?
Monica Geller: No, not here. Maybe here.
Chandler Bing: Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
Monica Geller: And it's so clean!!
