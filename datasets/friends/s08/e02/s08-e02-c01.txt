Chandler Bing: Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
Monica Geller: That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
Chandler Bing: And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
Monica Geller: Oh yeah, right.
Chandler Bing: We got the honeymoon.
Monica Geller: That's not 'til Thursday.
Chandler Bing: The wedding pictures?
Monica Geller: They won't be ready for weeks.
Chandler Bing: Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Monica Geller: That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
Chandler Bing: I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Monica Geller: Okay.

Chandler Bing: What? What did you take a picture of?
Joey Tribbiani: Nothing! It was something.
Chandler Bing: Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Rachel Green: Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
Chandler Bing: Oh.
Monica Geller: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Rachel Green: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
Chandler Bing: Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
Front Desk Clerk: Here's a copy of your bill.
Monica Geller: Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
