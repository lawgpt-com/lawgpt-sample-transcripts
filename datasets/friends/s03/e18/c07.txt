Ross Geller: All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Frank Buffay Jr.: What, you don't think I know that?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Ross Geller: Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Ross Geller: No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Frank Buffay Jr.: You don't have it anymore?
Ross Geller: No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Ross Geller: It didn't.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Joey Tribbiani: Now, wh-what, what is that like?
Frank Buffay Jr.: It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.

Ross Geller: Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I want it!
Frank Buffay Jr.: You can have it!
