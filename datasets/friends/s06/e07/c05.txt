Chandler Bing: OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Joey Tribbiani: I Gotcha!!
Chandler Bing: Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Joey Tribbiani: Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
