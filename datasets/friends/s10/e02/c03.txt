Monica Geller: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Chandler Bing: There's a hair in my coffee.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey guys!
Monica Geller: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Chandler Bing: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
Monica Geller: That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, what's all this stuff?
Monica Geller: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Monica Geller: That's not really how it works.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, how does it work?
Monica Geller: I don't know!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Monica Geller: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
Frank Buffay Jr.: That's not what we talked about!!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Good to see you.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Good to see you, too.
Monica Geller: Hi Frank.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Hi, how you doin'?
Monica Geller: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Monica Geller: Which one is which again?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
Monica Geller: "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
