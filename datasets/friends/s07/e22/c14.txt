Helena: Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?

Helena: We?
Chandler Bing: I know it would make me happy, ma'am.

Monica Geller: You okay?
Chandler Bing: Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Helena: Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
