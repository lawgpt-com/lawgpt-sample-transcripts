Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Monica Geller: I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Phoebe Buffay: No-no, I got that.
Monica Geller: So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: I mean $500.
Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: 600.
Monica Geller: What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
Monica Geller: What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Phoebe Buffay: Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
Monica Geller: Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!
Phoebe Buffay: No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Monica Geller: Really?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
Monica Geller: Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes.
Monica Geller: I guess.
Phoebe Buffay: Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
