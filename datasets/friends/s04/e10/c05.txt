Ross Geller: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah! With who?
Ross Geller: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them.

Phoebe Buffay: If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Ross Geller: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
