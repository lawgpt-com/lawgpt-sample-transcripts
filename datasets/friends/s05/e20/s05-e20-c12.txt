Ross Geller: Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Ross Geller: I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Monica Geller: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Chandler Bing: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Ross Geller: I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Chandler Bing: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Phoebe Buffay: Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
