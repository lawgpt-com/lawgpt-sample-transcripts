Phoebe Buffay: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!

Joey Tribbiani: Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
