Ross Geller: Hey guys!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Ross Geller: All right, here's the ring.
Chandler Bing: Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Ross Geller: So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Chandler Bing: Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Ross Geller: I sort've already asked Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani: What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Ross Geller: Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Chandler Bing: You can be the best man when I get married.
Joey Tribbiani: I'll never get to be a best man!
Ross Geller: Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Chandler Bing: Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Joey Tribbiani: What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Chandler Bing: I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Joey Tribbiani: I can't believe you're not picking me.
Ross Geller: Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Chandler Bing: I'm not even... I'm not even...
Ross Geller: Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Joey Tribbiani: Yes! Shame about you man.
