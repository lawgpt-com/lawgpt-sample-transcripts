Rachel Green: Hi!
Chandler Bing: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel Green: So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Chandler Bing: I can't seem to say goodbye.
Rachel Green: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Chandler Bing: Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Rachel Green: It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Chandler Bing: Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Rachel Green: Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Chandler Bing: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Rachel Green: Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
