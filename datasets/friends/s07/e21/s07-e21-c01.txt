Monica Geller: Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Chandler Bing: Do you realize you get louder each week?
Monica Geller: There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Chandler Bing: I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Monica Geller: Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Chandler Bing: Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Monica Geller: No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Chandler Bing: Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Monica Geller: Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Chandler Bing: Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
