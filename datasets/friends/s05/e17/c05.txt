Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh I just miss him so much!
Monica Geller: Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Monica Geller: I know it is the best.
Phoebe Buffay: So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Monica Geller: What? It's still going on.
Phoebe Buffay: Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Monica Geller: I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Monica Geller: What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Phoebe Buffay: God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Monica Geller: Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Chandler Bing: Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Monica Geller: You are so cute.
