Chandler Bing: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Okay.
Chandler Bing: I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Wow!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Chandler Bing: Then don't leave me!
Janice Litman Goralnik: What?
Chandler Bing: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Janice Litman Goralnik: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
Chandler Bing: No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Janice Litman Goralnik: I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing: Ohhh. Don't go.
Janice Litman Goralnik: No, I-I-I gotta go.
Chandler Bing: No. No! No! No!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Honey, honey, people are looking.
Chandler Bing: I don't care! I don't care!!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Chandler Bing: You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Gunther: Rachel has those in burgendy.
