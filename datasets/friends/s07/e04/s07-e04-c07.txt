Rachel Green: Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Tag Jones: I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Rachel Green: Kinda.
Tag Jones: Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Rachel Green: Oh-ohh, thank you.
Tag Jones: Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Rachel Green: Well...
Tag Jones: Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
Rachel Green: But I hired you!
Tag Jones: What?
Rachel Green: Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Tag Jones: I am?!
Rachel Green: Yeah!
Tag Jones: I can't believe it!
Rachel Green: Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
