Joey Tribbiani: What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Chandler Bing: Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Joey Tribbiani: Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Chandler Bing: How?
