Phoebe Buffay: Hi.
Monica Geller: Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Phoebe Buffay: Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
Chandler Bing: Oh, I'm so sorry!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
Chandler Bing: You're not gonna need my help?
Phoebe Buffay: Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Chandler Bing: Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Monica Geller: Ok, you got it!
Phoebe Buffay: Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Monica Geller: Really? If that's what you want...
Phoebe Buffay: That was a test and you just failed.
Monica Geller: Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Ross Geller: I have sex with dinosaurs??
Chandler Bing: I believe I read that somewhere!
Ross Geller: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
Chandler Bing: I respectfully disagree.
Ross Geller: I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Chandler Bing: Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
Ross Geller: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Chandler Bing: I don't have a page.
Ross Geller: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
