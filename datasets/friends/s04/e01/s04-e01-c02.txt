Phoebe Abbott: So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
Phoebe Buffay: I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe Abbott: Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
Phoebe Buffay: How close?
Phoebe Abbott: Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Phoebe Buffay: I don't even know how that would work!
Phoebe Abbott: Well, we were...
Phoebe Buffay: I'm not asking!
Phoebe Abbott: Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Phoebe Abbott: Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Phoebe Abbott: Wait!
Phoebe Buffay: I don't ever want to see you again!
