Phoebe Buffay: Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Chandler Bing: Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Chandler Bing: I'm not Jewish, so...
Phoebe Buffay: So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Chandler Bing: Bad dream?
Ross Geller: I wasn't sleeping.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Ross Geller: The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Phoebe Buffay: So, did you pick one yet?
Ross Geller: No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
Phoebe Buffay: Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Ross Geller: Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Chandler Bing: Prague?
Phoebe Buffay: There's sooo much you don't know.
