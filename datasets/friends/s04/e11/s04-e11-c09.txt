Older Scientist: Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Ross Geller: Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Joey Tribbiani: I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Ross Geller: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Joey Tribbiani: I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
