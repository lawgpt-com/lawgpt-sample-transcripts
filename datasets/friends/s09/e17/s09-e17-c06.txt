Phoebe Buffay: God, I wish Mike were here.
Monica Geller: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica Geller: What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Phoebe Buffay: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
Phoebe Buffay: Here.
Monica Geller: And now your cell.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Monica Geller: This is your cellphone?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes.
Monica Geller: This is your current cellphone?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, where's your purse?
Monica Geller: No, no! Give it to me!
Phoebe Buffay: You can't have it.
Monica Geller: Give it to me!
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Monica Geller: I'll go in there.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah.
Monica Geller: Phoebe come here.
Monica Geller: Haha!
Phoebe Buffay: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
