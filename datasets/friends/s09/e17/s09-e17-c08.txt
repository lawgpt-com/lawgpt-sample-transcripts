Monica Geller: Haha!
Phoebe Buffay: You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Monica Geller: So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Phoebe Buffay: Those are my shoes.
Monica Geller: Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Phoebe Buffay: Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Monica Geller: Who's that?
Phoebe Buffay: I ordered Chinese food.
Phoebe Buffay: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Monica Geller: What are you doing here?
Mike Hannigan: Phoebe called me.
Monica Geller: Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
Monica Geller: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe Buffay: There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Monica Geller: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Mike Hannigan: Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
Monica Geller: This doesn't concern you!!
Mike Hannigan: Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
Monica Geller: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Phoebe Buffay: Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Monica Geller: Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .
Phoebe Buffay: Sit down.
Monica Geller: Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
Mike Hannigan: So how've you been?
Monica Geller: I've been pretty good!
Mike Hannigan: You look really beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay: Thanks, you look good too.
Monica Geller: Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Phoebe Buffay: So how's the piano playing going?
Mike Hannigan: Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Phoebe Buffay: I've missed you too.
Monica Geller: You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
