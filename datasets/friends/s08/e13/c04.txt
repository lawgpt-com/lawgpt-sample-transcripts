Chandler Bing: Hey.
Monica Geller: Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Chandler Bing: Sex on the balcony?
Monica Geller: No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
Chandler Bing: What is it?
Monica Geller: I drew you a bath!
Chandler Bing: Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Monica Geller: Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!
Chandler Bing: Well, this does butch it up a bit.
Monica Geller: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
Chandler Bing: All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Monica Geller: Absolutely.

Monica Geller: Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.

Chandler Bing: All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
Monica Geller: So?
Chandler Bing: Oh my God.
Monica Geller: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Chandler Bing: I'm going to need a bigger boat.
