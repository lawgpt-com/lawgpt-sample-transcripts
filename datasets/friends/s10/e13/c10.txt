Chandler Bing: Hey! How was lunch?
Erica: We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob.
Chandler Bing: Oh, really?
Erica: No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Chandler Bing: O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Monica Geller: Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Chandler Bing: Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
Monica Geller: No it's not.
Chandler Bing: How do you know?
Erica: Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Chandler Bing: Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Monica Geller: The thing we never do.
Chandler Bing: Shovely Joe!
