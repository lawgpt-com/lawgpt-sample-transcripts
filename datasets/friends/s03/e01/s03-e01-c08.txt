Ross Geller: How could you have told her?
Rachel Green: Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Ross Geller: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Rachel Green: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Ross Geller: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Rachel Green: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Ross Geller: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Rachel Green: Were both of those Joey?
Ross Geller: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Rachel Green: Not even with your best friend.
Ross Geller: Noo!
Rachel Green: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Ross Geller: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Rachel Green: Pretty much.
Ross Geller: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Rachel Green: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Ross Geller: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
