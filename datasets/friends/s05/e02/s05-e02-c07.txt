#ALL#: Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Monica Geller: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Phoebe Buffay: Central... Park!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, all of us! All day!
Phoebe Buffay: That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Rachel Green: Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Chandler Bing: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Phoebe Buffay: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Monica Geller: Makes me wanna puke!
