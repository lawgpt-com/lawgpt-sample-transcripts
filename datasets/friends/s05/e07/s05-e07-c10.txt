Chandler Bing: Not even on page 7?
Ross Geller: Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Chandler Bing: What about that circled one?
Ross Geller: Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Joey Tribbiani: But it's available now! Isn't it?
