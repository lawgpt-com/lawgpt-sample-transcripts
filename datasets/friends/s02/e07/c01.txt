Chandler Bing: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?

Chandler Bing: Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Phoebe Buffay: No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Chandler Bing: Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Phoebe Buffay: No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Monica Geller: Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Chandler Bing: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Monica Geller: Please.
#ALL#: C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Phoebe Buffay: Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
