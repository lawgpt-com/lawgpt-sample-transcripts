Monica Geller: Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel Green: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica Geller: I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Rachel Green: And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Monica Geller: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Rachel Green: Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Monica Geller: Oh, please.

Ross Geller: Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Rachel Green: Got a job on a river boat?
Ross Geller: Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Rachel Green: Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Ross Geller: Right.
Rachel Green: Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Ross Geller: You like it right?
Monica Geller: Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Rachel Green: Yeah, come here!
Monica Geller: What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Rachel Green: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Ross Geller: Okay, good bye!
