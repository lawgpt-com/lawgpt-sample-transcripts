Monica Geller: Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Mike Hannigan: I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Phoebe Buffay: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Mike Hannigan: It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
Monica Geller: Kiss him, you fool!!
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Monica Geller: Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I missed you so much!
Strange Man: I knew you'd be here!
Mike Hannigan: Oh, crap!
Phoebe Buffay: Who is this?
Mike Hannigan: My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Monica Geller: Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Manny: Well, you are not doing a very good job!
Monica Geller: Excuse me?
Manny: What's with the kissing?
Monica Geller: Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Manny: Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Monica Geller: You didn't hear the speech!
Manny: I've heard the speech: "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
Monica Geller: Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Manny: You're weak!
Monica Geller: You're... weird!
Manny: Your pants are undone!
Monica Geller: Oh !
Manny: Where did they go?
Monica Geller: Damn it!
Manny: Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
Monica Geller: And I blame you too.
