Phoebe Buffay: Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: How do you feel?
Chandler Bing: Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Chandler Bing: And protected them from a tornado?

Monica Geller: Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay: I know, the babies are asleep.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Phoebe Buffay: I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Monica Geller: But my apartment!
Chandler Bing: Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Monica Geller: But the mess!
Chandler Bing: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Monica Geller: You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Chandler Bing: Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
