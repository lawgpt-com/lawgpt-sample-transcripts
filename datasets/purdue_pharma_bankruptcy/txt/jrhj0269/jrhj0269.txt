P R O C E E D I N G S

2

THE COURT:

Good morning.

This is Judge Drain and

3

we are here in In re Purdue Pharma L.P. et al.

4

proposed agenda for today’s hearing, and I’m happy to go

5

down that agenda in order unless someone believes they need

6

to make an introductory remark on something else.

7

MR. HUEBNER:

8

Good morning.

9

exactly our vision.

I have the

Your Honor, nothing from this end.

For the record, Marshall Huebner.

We have three uncontested matters and

10

three contested matters.

11

the order, which is what I was going to recommend.

12

That was

And I guess we will just go down

The first motion is actually going to be presented

13

by White & Case.

That is the Ad Hoc Group of Individual

14

Victims’ Protective Order Motion.

15

permission, I will turn the virtual podium over to them on

16

behalf of the personal injury claimants.

So with the Court’s

17

THE COURT:

Okay, that’s fine.

18

MR. SHORE:

Good morning, Your Honor. Chris Shore

19

Thank you.

from White & Case.

20

THE COURT:

Good morning.

21

MR. SHORE:

Does Your Honor have any questions?

22

THE COURT:

I have reviewed the motion and I think

23

it’s clear as to its purpose, which is to authorize the

24

initial work to be done on behalf of the PI trust pending

25

the effective date of the plan.

212-267-6868

And tied into that is,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

subject to the terms of the protective order and this order,

2

the access of certain people who will be working on behalf

3

of the trust to information that constitutes, “protected

4

health information” under 45 CFR § 160.103.

5

So this appears to me to be reasonable relief

6

under the circumstances.

One of the goals of the Ad Hoc

7

Group of Individual Victims and other personal injury

8

claimants is to expedite the treatment of their claims and

9

distributions on allowed claims from the trust to be set up

10

under the plan, and a considerable amount of work needs to

11

be done to facilitate that.

12
13

So it seems clear to me.

I don’t know if you have anything more to say on
it, Mr. Shore, or are you going to rely on the motion?

14

MR. SHORE:

I will rely on the motion, and I will

15

when we get to the contested matter address the issue of the

16

importance, if it’s necessary to do so, the importance of

17

getting this process started so that when we get to an

18

effective date, we could be up and running with the trust.

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

So I understand that the motion

20

is unopposed.

21

basis when it was filed, but that was on August 6th.

22

it’s September 13th.

23

regular notice of the motion.

24

are no objections to it.

25

further to say on it, I will grant the motion.

212-267-6868

It was originally sought on an expedited

4

MR. SHORE:

We’ll do that.

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

6

MR. SHORE:

Thank you, Your Honor.

7

Your Honor, the second motion is a motion by

8

Daniel Carpenter that will be handled by Ms. Kathryn

9

Benedict of Davis Polk.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

11

MS. BENEDICT:

Good morning, Your Honor.

For the

12

record, Kathryn Benedict of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP on

13

behalf of the debtors.

14
15

THE COURT:

Can you hear me clearly?
Yes, I can hear you and see you fine.

Thanks.

16

MS. BENEDICT:

Thank you.

Mr. Carpenter’s late

17

claim motion is at Docket Number 3526.

18

individualized assertions in Mr. Carpenter’s motion, the

19

Debtors believe there is a colorable basis for granting Mr.

20

Carpenter’s request.

21

Based on the

In addition, the Debtors consulted with the

22

Creditors’ Committee and the Ad Hoc Group of Individual

23

Victims regarding the individualized circumstances

24

surrounding Mr. Carpenter’s request, and each has consented

25

to the relief requested.

Accordingly, the Debtor’s request that the

2

proposed order submitted at Docket Number 3733 be entered.

3

I am happy to answer any questions Your Honor may have.

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

I don’t have any questions.

5

have reviewed Mr. Carpenter’s motion.

6

anyone have anything further to say on his motion?

7

I will grant the motion.

I

Let me just ask, does
Okay.

I agree with the

8

Debtor’s decision not to oppose it.

Mr. Carpenter’s motion

9

lays out clearly that having contracted COVID and having

10

been incarcerated during most of the COVID period as a

11

result without access to information regarding the bar date,

12

he has shown excusable neglect for purposes of Bankruptcy

13

Rule 9006 in the Supreme Court’s Pioneer case.

14
15

So you can email the proposed order to chambers
and it will be entered shortly.

16

MS. BENEDICT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

With that,

17

I’ll turn over the podium to Mr. Lerner at Squire Patton

18

Boggs.

THE COURT:

20

MR. LERNER:

Okay.

Lerner of Squire Patton Boggs.

I can hear you and see you fine.

MR. LERNER:

know, obviously I served as an examiner in the case for

to that effect on Friday.

9

I

Obviously there was a lot of work done in

10

a short period, and the time here is reasonable.

11

you’re taking somewhat of a discount because of the cap that

12

I placed on the fees.

13

So I will grant the application.

Indeed,

I believe you or

THE COURT:

5

MR. VONNEGUT:

Can you hear me, Your

Yes, I can hear you fine.
Thank you.

Thanks.

I will be brief on the

6

Trust Authorization Motion, Your Honor, because I think our

7

papers mostly speak for themselves.

8

basic (indiscernible) will be helpful.

9

But I believe some

The plan has a lot of infrastructure in it that

10

needs to be established in order to reconcile all of the

11

claims and actually get money out the door and into the

12

hands of personal injury claimants and the abatement

13

initiative (indiscernible) that the plan distributes

14

(indiscernible) funds.

15

trusts, the PI Trust, which has sub-comments for NAS and

16

non-NAS personal injury claims, as well as the Master

17

Disbursement Trust and Topco, which will both help direct

18

distributions to all of these different trusts.

19

There is a network of five abatement

I think the most salient example is the Personal

20

Injury Trust, which before it’s going to be able to get

21

distributions out to claimants will need to establish a

22

claims database, a web portal, online forms, and test all of

23

that to make sure that it works so that the PI Trust will be

24

able to reconcile approximately 140,000 filed claims as it’s

25

required to do under the plan.

So in other words, this isn’t a simple case in

2

which emergence comes, we press a button, we send a couple

3

wires and we call it a day.

4

necessary to actually get money into the hands of creditors.

5

There’s a lot more work

If we waited until emergency to do all of that

6

work, the trusts would receive their distributions on the

7

effective date of the plan, but then they would have to sit

8

on the cash for several months while they built the

9

infrastructure necessary to process the claims and get

10

distributions out.

11

And so knowing that we would have at least a

12

couple of months of lag time between confirmation and

13

emergency for regulatory processes and the DOJ settlement,

14

several months ago the Ad Hoc Group of Individual Victims

15

reached out to us and suggested that an advanced

16

distribution to the PI trust following confirmation would

17

help reduce that lag time and enable the trust to be much

18

more ready on the emergency date to start actually sending

19

money out.

20

That struck the Debtor as a great idea.

We

21

thought other creditor groups might likewise appreciate

22

having a bit of lead time in order to get their legal

23

vehicles ready.

24

creditors, compiled proposed budgets.

25

the comprehensive proposal reflected in the motion.

212-267-6868

So we coordinated with all of our
That’s what led to

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 22
1

We got a limited number of objections filed by a

2

subset of the states that are still opposing the plan,

3

Maryland, Connecticut, Oregon, and Washington, as well as

4

the U.S. Trustee.

5

the Canadian municipal claimants.

6

And then a very brief joinder filed by

All of the objectors effectively have variations

7

on the theme that they believe these payments are in one way

8

or another really an effort to equitably move appeals of the

9

confirmation of the plan before we’ve actually been able to

10

emerge.

11

So I just want to address those concerns briefly.
The total amount that we are seeking authority to

12

spend under this motion is $6.855 million.

13

funds are going to creditors.

14

build plan infrastructure.

15

the Sacklers.

None of those

It’s all just being used to

None of the money is coming from

This is all estate cash on hand.

16

I think a helpful reference point in terms of size

17

here is that the estate has spent an average of $8.7 million

18

per month to date on creditor professional fees.

19

frankly, don’t really view these expenditures as any

20

different, and we think it would be ridiculous for us to

21

argue that these payments would somehow moot appeals of

22

confirmation of a plan and a settlement before the plan and

23

the settlement before the plan and the settlement are

24

consummated.

25

We,

We didn’t hear from the objectors before they

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 23
1

filed their pleadings.

2

reached out to make very clear to them that we were not

3

attempting to moot appeals, that we were not trying to treat

4

consummation of the plan as a foregone conclusion, and

5

offered to stipulate on the point to try to resolve the

6

objection.

7

But as soon as we saw them, we

The concern that we heard in response was, well,

8

what about the Sacklers?

What about other creditors?

9

do I know that they won’t make these arguments?

How

That’s a

10

fair point.

11

group that we have and we confirmed that they all agree with

12

the Debtors, that these payments pre-emergence would not

13

have the effect of mooting appeals during the pre-emergence

14

window.

15

So we reached out to every organized creditor

So we took that back to the objectors, and we’ve

16

heard two different things in response.

One is a concern

17

that even if we, the Debtors, and all the creditors agree to

18

this language in the order, that some other parties might

19

not be bound by it or that an appellate court might conclude

20

sua sponte that somehow these payments do moot appeals of

21

the plan.

22

The four states that are objecting suggested that

23

the stipulation that these payments wouldn’t equitably moot

24

appeals of confirmation doesn’t go far enough, but that

25

instead we and all the creditors should stipulate that full

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 24
1

consummation of the plan and the settlement also would not

2

moot appeals.

3

We discussed it with them.

4

correct substantively.

5

this motion over an unrelated issue.

6

that were made as to how the settlement and the plan might

7

be adjusted to make that work we just didn’t think were

8

practical.

9

So we took that suggestion to the creditors.
We all just don’t think that’s

We don’t think it’s right to hold up
And the suggestions

So where that leaves us, Your Honor, is the

10

Debtors and the overwhelming majority of all of the

11

creditors in the case are just trying to do what we think is

12

a good and simple thing; we are trying to get creditors

13

their money faster.

14

the objectors’ concerns, and we don’t think that asking

15

creditors to accept more delay over a theoretical concern

16

that somebody might make an argument that we all think is

17

crazy is the right way to be arranging our priorities in

18

this case.

19

We think that we’ve addressed all of

I continue to believe that the creditors’

20

preferences are much more important than the Debtor’s

21

preferences in this case, and I know they feel very strongly

22

about this.

23

propose to proceed is to ask the objectors to speak for

24

themselves as to what their remaining concerns are.

25

then I know Mr. Preis would like to address this matter, as

212-267-6868

But if it’s okay with Your Honor, how we would

2

THE COURT:

Okay.

3

MR. VONNEGUT:

4

MR. HIGGINS:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Your Honor, Ben Higgins for the U.S.

5

Trustee.

I can start for the objecting side if that’s

6

acceptable to Your Honor.

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. HIGGINS:

9

Okay.
Thank you, Your Honor.

I agree with

Mr. Vonnegut that we are concerned with preserving the

10

status quo so that there can be an appellate review of the

11

merits of the Court’s decision approving the plan.

12

And to be clear, we do appreciate the efforts of

13

the Debtors to craft language providing that the proposed

14

funding won’t support an equitable mootness argument.

15

we also appreciate the reference to get a consent among the

16

various parties for this principle.

17

certain that such an order would be binding on an appellate

18

court or binding on all the parties to this case.

19

And

But we don’t know for

And there is ample caselaw in the Second Circuit

20

that shows that an appellant that does not diligently

21

attempt to preserve the status quo runs the risk of having

22

its appeal dismissed as equitably moot.

23

illustrate that concern, at the last hearing on the KERP

24

motion back in July, Your Honor referenced a recent district

25

court decision in Harrington v. LSC Communications.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And just to

And in

516-608-2400

Page 26
1

that case, the debtor appellees argue that bonus payments to

2

six officer which totaled less than a million dollars

3

rendered the U.S. Trustee’s appeal as equitably moot because

4

the payments constituted a change in circumstances.

5

And now the district court ruled in the U.S.

6

Trustee’s favor on that point and decided that we could

7

reach the merits, but the district court didn’t say the

8

appellee’s argument was frivolous or crazy, as Mr. Vonnegut

9

suggests, and it did warn that an appellant’s failure to

10

obtain a stay in the context of plan confirmation would be

11

dire.

12

work necessary to implement the plan.

13

concerned, and I think justifiably so based on Second

14

Circuit law, that any steps taken to implement the plan

15

could constitute grounds for an appellate court to dismiss

16

an appeal as equitably moot.

And the purpose of the current motion is to perform

17

And we are highly

And to be clear, we do intend to move

18

expeditiously with any appellate practice.

19

of the stay of the confirmation order is not yet before the

20

Court, but we are also concerned about whether there are

21

actions that the Debtors could undertake even before the

22

effective date under the Confirmation Order or the

23

Restructuring Steps Memorandum that could have the effect of

24

scrambling the eggs or ringing the bell that can’t be

25

unrung, or choose whatever metaphor you want, Your Honor.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And the question

516-608-2400

Page 27
1

But the Second Circuit law was clear that if we just sit on

2

our hands, we allow comprehensive change in circumstances to

3

take place, then we do run the risk that an appellate court

4

will never hear the merits of an appeal.

5

And it’s also worth noting that the Debtors have

6

bound themselves under the shareholder agreement at Section

7

2.09 to oppose any request for a stay pending appeal.

8

if no stay is granted and the plan is consummated, or even

9

if before consummation there are sufficient changes in

And

10

circumstances, there is a real danger that an appeals court

11

will never reach the merits.

12

And from our perspective, that is a problem.

And

13

frankly, regardless of the outcome of an appeal on this

14

case, we believe the integrity of the bankruptcy system is

15

best served by an appeals court deciding that appeal on the

16

merits.

17
18

And so we would request that just hold this motion
in abeyance pending the outcome of (indiscernible).

2

don’t have any feeling I need to repeat that.

3

I would just add that, as Mr. Higgins alluded to,

4

we are expecting that sometime soon there will be an order

5

confirming the plan and that then there will be motions for

6

a stay pending appeal.

this motion is premature until a stay pending appeal as to

for something that may not occur.

a misimpression here.

As I read the proposed order,

2

Paragraph 11 provides that if the Debtors are unable to

3

consummate the plan after some or all of the proposed

4

advances have been issued.

5

required to be returned to the Debtors.

6

provides further the Debtors shall be required to prenotice

7

the motion, and absent further authorization from the Court,

9

Monitoring Trust, the Third Party Payor Trust, TAFT, the

10

Hospital Trust, and NOAT shall be recharacterized and/or

Bankruptcy Code as payments on account of the claims

asserted by the holders of the applicable claims, and

So how is this going out the door?

18

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, actually if the money was

recharacterized in that manner, it wouldn’t actually be in

the pockets of any creditors.

THE COURT:

Right.

It doesn’t go out the door.

It’s recharacterized.

MR. GOLDMAN:

So that is

I did notice the provision that Your Honor just

THE COURT:

6

MR. GOLDMAN:

Okay.
I would also -- if Your Honor is

7

inclined to grant the motion, I would just ask that there be

8

an express finding in the order that this money spent and

9

the preparatory actions taken wouldn’t constitute

10

substantial consummation.

11

THE COURT:

Well, I’m perfectly happy to make that

12

finding as well as state that the appellee in any appeal,

13

which would be the Debtors only since they are the proponent

14

of the plan, has waived the right to argue equitable

15

mootness.

16

MR. VONNEGUT:
that.

Your Honor, we’re fine with all of

clear.

23

that these payments to expedite distributions to creditors

would justify equitable mootness.

So, look, everyone in this case is, rightly so,

being a careful lawyer.

So I’m not faulting people for

making the objection.

12

these circumstances that the concern that the U.S. Trustee

The motion has appropriate safeguards in it, as

6

just quoted from paragraph 11 of the proposed order as far

7

as any reallocation and/or return of the funds if for some

8

reason the plan does not go forward to the effective date.

9

Further, the Debtors have agreed to waive the argument of

10

equitable mootness on appeal insofar as it could be argued

11

with respect to the grant of this motion and the expenditure

12

of these funds.

13

given that they are the only proponents of the plan.

on that appeal, but it is their right to argue equitable

mootness.

17

that argument generally, but they recognize that they are

18

not really giving up anything meaningful to waive equitable

19

mootness based on the grant of this motion given the fact

20

would conclude that the grant of this motion and its

we went to our creditors and engaged in extensive

negotiation with key stakeholders.

lay out, we made a bunch of modifications, which I’ll get to

in a few minutes, that led to the Ad Hoc Committee, the MSGE

objections to the substantially amended 2021 KEIP plan.

Your Honor, of course much of the program is going

22

to be quite familiar to the Court, as it is in fact nearly

23

identical to the incentive plan approved by this Court last

24

year and quite similar to the one approved by the Court the

25

year before that.

212-267-6868

This is an annual plan, and we’ll talk in

alleged concerns about timing and the like.

3

Your Honor, with respect to the evidence, once

again, it is all on our side and it’s quite substantial.

5

There are two supporting declarations.

6

originally two supporting declarations from Jon Lowne, the

Debtor’s CFO.

director at Willis Tower Watson, who was the independent

compensation consultant who advised the Comp Committee.

There were

objections.

other two objectors, which we’ll get to, either don’t intend

to cross-examine, or I think Mr. Troop reserved his rights

or two.

2

So I would like to move formally to have Docket

3

Number 3744 entered into evidence as another declaration in

4

support of the motion.

5
6

THE COURT:

Well, let me -- were you going to

present Ms. Gartrell first and then Mr. Lowne?

7

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, there is no -- I

8

wasn’t going to present Ms. Gartrell because nobody wants to

9

cross-examine her and her declaration is already admitted

10

into evidence as of July.

And so I think that’s just in and

11

done.

12

assume Mr. Schwartzberg would cross-examine Mr. Lowne.

13

said he had a few questions for him, which of course he is

14

well within his rights to want to ask.

I was going to present the motion first.

15

THE COURT:

Okay.

And I
He

I did admit Ms. Gartrell’s

16

declaration in the hearing in July, which was on the KERP.

17

But let me ask Ms. Gartrell to go under oath with respect to

18

the declaration regarding the KEIP.

19

Ms. Gartrell, would you raise your right hand,

20

please?

Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole

21

truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

22

MS. GARTRELL:

23

THE COURT:

I do.

So, Ms. Gartrell, in a declaration

24

dated June 28th, 2021, you submitted your testimony in

25

support of the Debtor’s motion, which sought both approval

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 38

of the 2021 KERP and the 2021 KEIP.

2

the Debtor’s request for approval of the 2021 KEIP, which

3

request had been adjourned pending the conclusion of the

4

confirmation hearing.

5

We are here today on

Sitting here today, September 13th, and knowing

6

that the Debtor’s motion itself as supplemented in its reply

7

and by Mr. Lowne’s second supplemental declaration updates,

8

the Court, on changes to the KEIP that have since negotiated

9

and the like.

10

Is there anything that you would wish to

change in your June 28th declaration?

11

MS. GARTRELL:

Your Honor, nothing more than

12

what’s in the motion and the reply.

13

KEIP have changed, and the fact that there is no

14

acceleration upon emergence has changed.

So that is

15

different from what’s in my declaration.

But I don’t have

16

anything else to add.

17
18

THE COURT:

So does anyone want to cross-

examine Ms. Gartrell on her declaration?

19
20

Okay.

So the payments of the

All right.

I will admit it for purposes of this

motion, this aspect of the motion, that is.

Okay, so you can go ahead, Mr. Huebner, to Mr.

would propose to swear him in now and then we can have

24

argument after his testimony.

3

MR. LOWNE:

I do.

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

Mr. Lowne, you submitted an

5

initial declaration in support of the Debtor’s motion for

6

approval of a KERP and a KEIP for 2021.

7

28th, 2021.

8

second declaration in support of that portion of the motion

9

seeking approval of the KEIP that’s dated September 9th,

10

2021, which I’ll refer to as your second declaration, is

11

there anything in your first declaration, the one from June,

12

that you wish to change?

13

It was dated June

Recognizing that you have since submitted a

MR. LOWNE:

No, other than the updates that were

14

made in the second declaration, which included for example

15

an update in the performance of the scorecard metrics,

16

nothing else that I would want to change.

17

THE COURT:

Okay.

And let me ask you the same

18

question regarding your second declaration.

19

a few days, but is there anything that you would wish to

20

update in that one, knowing that it would constitute your

21

direct testimony for this aspect of the motion?

22

MR. LOWNE:

23

MR. HUEBNER:

CROSS-EXAMINATION OF JONATHAN LOWNE

BY MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

7

Q

Mr. Lowne, can you hear me okay?

8

A

I can.

9

Q

Great.

Just initially, Mr. Lowne, it is a pleasure to

10

see you again.

11

A

Likewise.

12

Q

I wanted to first examine the innovation and efficiency

13

metrics that you list.

14

A

Sure.

15

Q

The payment is contingent upon the Debtor achieving

16

certain performance metrics, correct?

17

A

Correct.

18

Q

And there is a threshold level that needs to be met

19

before an award can be paid for that metric, correct?

20

A

Correct.

21

Q

And I believe it’s 75 percent of the award is earned

22

when the threshold level is met, correct?

23

A

That is the threshold, correct.

24

Q

Please turn to -- I’m going to reference your initial

25

declaration.

212-267-6868

We haven’t spoken in quite some time.

It’s Paragraph 29, which I believe is Page 71

All right, excellent.

4

metrics that need to be met for the innovation and

5

efficiency performance metric, correct?

6

A

That’s correct.

7

Q

And the target level metric needs to be met for the

8

full award for each metric to be paid, correct?

9

A

That is correct.

10

Q

Table 4 does not list the threshold metric that needs

11

to be met for the 75 percent award.

12

A

13

single metric.

14

for each of these financial metrics in Table 4 that would

15

determine the payouts upon achieving or exceeding or not

16

achieving each of these financial metrics you refer to.

17

Q

18

threshold metric is for each.

19

A

Yes.

20

Q

If you look at the first one, the consolidated total

21

business operating profit, it’s a target of $69 million.

22

What is the threshold metric for that performance award?

23

A

24

It’s a scale that goes from -- all the way from zero to

25

above a hundred percent, from my recollection.

Correct.

And there is a Table 4.
Thank you.
That table lists the target

Is that correct?

The 75 metric is an aggregate across every

And there’s

different dollar amounts that would determine the payout.

So, again, the 75 percent is across the totality of all of

the metrics that are in the scorecard.

We had a non-linear scale to the best of my

11

recollection that determined the payout for each of these

12

financial metrics.

Q

cannot give me the dollar amount for the threshold metric

for the consolidated total business operating profit?

I have a few other questions regarding historical financial

information.

5

A

Sure.

6

Q

The Debtor’s 2020 performance metrics -- this is on

7

Table 4 -- the 2020 performance, or the results of the 2020

8

are not included in Table 4 or your declaration.

Okay.

Thank you.

I am going to stay at that table and

Is that

A

That’s correct.

11

Q

Okay.

12

consolidated total business operating profit metric.

13

According to the supplement you filed on Paragraph 15, that

14

metric was not part of the 2020 incentive plan.

15

correct?

16

A

Correct.

17

Q

And in fact it’s a combination of three metrics that

18

were used in the 2020 KEIP plan.

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

And just so we could be more specific, it deals with

21

the combination of three older metrics, or the Purdue

22

Branded Operating Profit Metric from 2020, the Adhansia XR

23

Operating Loss Metric, and the Avrio Operating Profit

24

Metric, all from 2020.

Q

Whether that -- I’m sorry, I apologize.

A

No, that’s really all I was going to say.

I’m just going to see if you know these numbers.

What about the 2020 Adhansia XR Operating Loss?

10

Do you have the 2020 results from that?

11

A

I don’t have it in front of me, no.

12

Q

And just the last one, the 2020 Avrio Operating Profit,

if I’m pronouncing that correctly.

Again, I don’t have that in front of me, no.

3

A

Yeah.

4

Q

That was not -- that’s a new metric, correct?

5

A

It’s a newly-worded metric, yes.

6

Q

And the old metric was an operating loss, a Rhodes

7

operating loss at $35 million, correct?

8

A

The 2020 metric was worded that way, yes.

9

Q

Okay.

10

A

The 2020 operating loss I think was in the region of

11

about $35 million.

12

Q

13

payments, did they make the target or did they not make the

14

target?

15

hard to say from your testimony which occurred.

16

Q

17

close to that target, but I’d have to go back and look and

18

compare for the Rhodes business the actual loss versus the

target.

Q

business operating profit.

22

correct?

That’s correct.

business operating profit.

Is that correct?

2

A

That is correct.

3

Q

And if my math is correct, the three 2020 metrics that

4

make up the consolidated total business operating profit

5

added up to $79.6 million?

6

A

I trust your math for those three metrics, yes.

7

Q

Just your 2020 declaration in support of the 2020 KEIP,

which you probably don’t have in front of you.

That’s ECF

There was a table that you may recall that listed the

out that those were $79.6 million.

Page 4 of your supplemental application.

I want to turn to the Value Creation Metric, which I

And do you see

10

there is a table that starts at the bottom of Page 4 that

11

spills over to Page 5 and 6?

12

A

Yes.

13

Q

Do you see the first -- it’s under Public Health

14

Initiatives, “Provides support to HRT to allow an NDA filing

15

for OTC intranasal Naloxone”?

16

A

Yes.

17

Q

Now, it seemed to indicate that that metric needs to be

18

met by Q3 and it’s behind schedule, correct?

19

A

Yes.

20

Q

If that metric gets met in Q4, will there still be an

21

award paid?

22

that?

23

A

24

for each quarter that a metric is behind schedule, there is

25

a reduced payout percentage.

Or once Q3 is done, there can’t be an award on

So, similar to the financial metrics that I describe,

212-267-6868

And for each quarter that a

above target or above the hundred percent.

that exact scale.

4

it's the same concept.

made the comment earlier that the 75 percent threshold or

there is a bonus -- I’m sorry, an award above compensation

So that was how I came up -- why I

That’s exactly right.

3

All right.

So I did have a couple of

And this may lead to redirect.

Mr. Schwartzberg took you through the chart that

4

is in Paragraph 11 of your supplemental declaration.

5

think with the exception perhaps of Adhansia where that

6

chart shows that some metric is behind schedule or not to be

7

achieved, your answer was that it still might well warrant

8

payment above the threshold, albeit below the target.

9

you recall that testimony?

10

THE WITNESS:

Yes.

And I

Do

And if I wasn’t clear, my

11

recollection based upon our midyear review is that for this

12

individual metric, the payout may actually be less than the

13

75 percent threshold.

14

THE COURT:

Right.

That’s for Adhansia.

But for

15

the other ones on the chart, my understanding was that where

16

your chart had said not achieved by target date, behind

17

schedule in a number of places.

18

Adhansia, the measurement might still lead to a payment

19

under the KEIP, albeit one that is below the target, but

20

still above the threshold?

21

THE WITNESS:

22

THE COURT:

23

THE WITNESS:

With the exception of

That’s correct.

Yeah.

Okay.
If it’s helpful, Your Honor, we did

24

do a midyear review in the aggregate across all of the

25

metrics, some of which are overperforming, some of which are

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 56

underperforming, and some are on track.

2

that the payout would be something around 95 percent.

3

that’s the aggregate.

4

THE COURT:

We estimated then
So

So let me ask you, what is the

5

rationale for having a payment above the threshold, albeit

6

below the target, if the target is not met?

7

THE WITNESS:

Well, I think the two parts to my

8

answer -- I mean, we do look at the scorecard in aggregate,

9

which -- so we look at all of the metrics, add up the scores

10

of all of them, and that was the 95 percent that I came up

11

with.

12

percent threshold as opposed to -- I think what your

13

question is, if all of the individual metrics added up in

14

aggregate to 70 percent, why wouldn’t you pay 70 percent

15

versus 75 percent.

16

considering the KEIP program, we wanted to be incentivizing

17

enough given the uncertainty of the situation to our

18

insiders.

19

some minimum level that would -- the insiders would

20

understand given that uncertainty and given the fact that

21

these payments are now not going to happen until June 30th

22

of next year.

But I think the rationale for coming up with a 75

I think the answer is that as we were

Okay.

So is achieving -- or when

24

these metrics were set -- and I gather they were set -- even

many months ago.

In achieving these metrics, is it hard to

achieve the threshold?

3

THE WITNESS:

I think we set the objectives, they

We presented to all of

the employees in early February.

15

And it certainly appears that we are going to be

THE COURT:

And if you ask me my best guess now in

Okay.

What was the basis, if this was

16

the case, for thinking back last February that the threshold

17

would be difficult to achieve?

18

THE WITNESS:

So to the best of my recollection,

19

the concept of the threshold was not discussed back in

20

February of last year to the best of my recollection.

21

think this was something that we discussed in light of the

22

fact that we couldn’t confirm to our insiders the incentive

plan.

24

the time of filing the various declarations to the Court.

25

That’s my memory, and any of the lawyers can correct my

THE COURT:

set later?

when the 75 percent was discussed.

it was the delay in implementing the incentive plan.

So you are still under oath.

My focus

8

was really on the rationale for a threshold award that is

9

below the performance targets.

10

MS. GARTRELL:

11

THE COURT:

12

Yes.

And what is your understanding as to

when the threshold award aspect of the KEIP was adopted?

13

MS. GARTRELL:

14

historical measurement.

15

2021 KEIP, there was the concept of having a threshold

performance metric at 75 percent of target and then a

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

My understanding was that it’s a

Okay.

And what is the rationale in an

Page 61
1

incentive plan to have the plan provide for a threshold

2

amount even if the target is not met by 25 percent or less?

3

MS. GARTRELL:

So if you don’t hit the threshold,

4

there is no payment.

But companies typically want to have

5

some performance sensitivity and still incentivize their

6

senior leadership team to continue to try to achieve target,

but recognize that they still need to have skin in the game

and that it’s not just a make or miss target.

there is some sliding scale at a threshold level up to

And is that a common feature for

14

MS. GARTRELL:

15

THE COURT:

19

threshold, the 100 percent target, and suggesting that there

20

be no maximum or upside for exceeding target.

21

My team was involve in helping set the 75 percent

THE COURT:

So then you and our team were involved

22

in setting the 75 percent threshold I gather from your

23

answer.

24

MS. GARTRELL:

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Yes.

And the rationale for that was -- I’m

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 62
1

taking from your answer, tell me if I’m wrong, two things.

2

One, there was no -- the upside under the prior compensation

3

arrangement has been removed.

4

was a 75 percent threshold met as opposed to say 90 percent

5

or 65 percent?

6

MS. GARTRELL:

And why particularly that it

Typically, Your Honor, the

7

threshold is set somewhere either at 50 percent or 75

8

percent.

9

upside maximum can be somewhere between 150 to 200 percent.

10

And so 75 percent seemed like a conservative and reasonable

11

threshold performance metric.

12

And then targets at a hundred percent.

THE COURT:

And the

Did it have anything to do with the

13

market assessment of base compensation for these five

14

people?

15

MS. GARTRELL:

16

THE COURT:

No.

It’s purely a design feature.

Well, maybe I wasn’t clear.

The

17

declaration states that for four of the executives, their

18

base level of compensation is between 45 percent and 60

19

percent of executives that perform similar functions in the

20

industry.

21

you saying to me that the -- saying a below target threshold

22

for an incentive plan really had nothing to do with that

23

factor or that fact?

24
25

The one exception being the general counsel.

MS. GARTRELL:

So my answer is two parts.

7

In this case -- so it does have -- so the

So from that

But here, the KEIP pays out at

That’s how the bonus is

And then a hundred percent at target.

THE COURT:

Okay.

So really it’s more -- the

8

choice of the 75 percent threshold was simply more focused

9

on what a threshold structure is generally in the industry?

10

MS. GARTRELL:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

It’s

11

whether you have hit 75 percent of your target from a

12

performance perspective then determines the payout.

13

it’s actually a conservative number because it’s typically

14

50 percent.

15
16

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

And

Does anyone have

any questions of Ms. Gartrell related to that discussion?

would be.

THE COURT:

Ms. Gartrell, I want to just follow up

20

on one point from Mr. Schwartzberg.

21

management set these goals, were these goals then reviewed

22

by the compensation committee and the Board?

23

MS. GARTRELL:

Yes.

When you said

So the typical process is

24

that management sets the goals and they can change year over

And it’s my understanding that they’ve had some

4

achievement of those goals toward the end of the year.

5

it’s my understanding that they will assess the achievement

6

of those goals at the beginning of 2022.

And so the management typically sets the

MS. GARTRELL:

Management presents the goals to

financial, and individual achievements.

I don’t recall

13

whether I told you you could sign off, Mr. Lowne, but you

MS. GARTRELL:

MR. HUEBNER:

18

Thank you.
Your Honor, is it okay to proceed

with argument now?

19

THE COURT:

Yes.

It’s my understanding that no

one else had any evidence.

So hearing no one, yes, we

21

should go ahead with oral argument.

22

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

23

So, Your Honor, the 2021 KEIP, like the KERP, was

24

designed to parallel last year’s program that was approved

25

by this Court after substantial negotiation with multiple

212-267-6868

Page 70

creditor groups and the, you know, not particularly

2

contested, but somewhat contested hearing.

3

The adjustments and concessions that were

4

negotiated last year were actually put in, and in many ways

5

deepened even further this year, which I’ll talk bout in a

6

few minutes.

7

2021 KERP approved in July, the 2021 KEIP is essentially a

8

renewal of the program.

9

And so it is important to note that like the

And, Your Honor, it’s a renewable program, but as

10

we have now been discussing at hearings for over three

11

years, programs that are 20 and 30 years old.

12

special bankruptcy bonuses, nothing of the kind.

13

this is a degradation of the components of annual

14

compensation that have been at this company, and frankly

15

other companies in their industry, because the programs are

16

entirely typical, for literally decades, except that they

17

have been adjusted not in the executives’ favor in the

18

context of these Chapter 11 cases for various reasons.

19

Right?

20

levels were reduced, the percentiles, the payout timing.

3

Your Honor, it should be noted that, as I

4

sometimes point out, it’s easy to think of Purdue merely as

5

a debtor or merely as a defendant.

6

23 complicated operating pharmaceutical companies.

7

challenges of 2021 are almost unthinkable, running a

8

pharmaceutical company making complex, and frankly dangerous

But Purdue is actually

11

dislocation in the world.

12

And the

And as Your Honor knows, very often the cash

13

balance and the value of debtors dwindles by hundreds of

14

millions or billions of dollars during the bankruptcy case.

15

And one thing that I think gets lost in the maelstrom of

16

litigation about the proper end of these cases and which

17

creditors get what and all of that, is that the actual

18

maintenance of the value of these enterprises, all of which

19

is going to their victims, is due to actual human beings who

20

come to work all day, every day, in circumstances that are

21

very, very challenging to say the least.

Your Honor, let’s now look at the numbers for a

That’s what we’re talking about.

And that’s basically the same except for very

The 2021 KEIP all in is $5.39 million for all five

That’s the

small annual salary increases in COLA and the like of the

2

$5.21 million approved by this Court last year.

3

The 2021 long-term award is $1.71 million for all

4

five, which is the same exact amount as last year.

5

terms of COLA and purchasing power, it’s actually, you know,

6

in consistent dollars, it’s actually less than last year.

7

And all of the payments under the KEIP are subject to the

8

metrics which I’ll talk about in a few minutes.

9

So in

It's important to note that the changes that were

10

made in weeks of negotiations with the UCC, the AHC, and the

11

MSGE are very material, and frankly, very much serve the

12

goals that many of us are working to accomplish in these

13

Chapter Elevens.

14

First of all, the payments are now not being paid

15

until June 30, 2022.

None of them.

pretty much every company that has any sort of deferred

compensation, it’s often paid in February or March of the

20

following year once you can sort of validate that the goals

21

were met and the comp committee goes through it in detail.

We are

And of course the revised order, Your Honor, goes
without saying, includes the language that we all ended up

10

coming up with in connection with Your Honor’s ruling at the

11

July 2021 KERP hearing, which essentially just makes

somewhat more concrete and adds more procedure to the

13

standard that we agreed to six hearings ago in early 2020

ask five senior executives who work for 27 below the 25th

percentile of compensation for their industry peers, which

20

is probably something like 75 percent less than market comp

22

which nobody contests the very material attrition laid out

in the documents, the unfilled positions, the length of time

somehow, they just say that because people got market

Third, Washington points to the compensation paid

As Washington knows perfectly well, the majority

12

of the Board was brought in new and clean, as we discussed

with no facts, Washington says that the key participants are

The notion that because he helped bring this plan

And, Your Honor, if you look at the Lowne Second

5

Supplemental Declaration at Paragraph 9, after going through

6

in prior paragraphs the roles of Mr. Mancinelli and Mr.

7

Lundie, who don’t even live in or near New York and work

8

down in operations, who obviously had basically nothing at

9

all to do with the plan.

Paragraph 9 also confirms that

10

even Dr. Landau has never attended a single meeting with

11

stakeholders to advocate for implementation of the plan.

12

So this canard of Washington that these five have

13

been running around trying to get themselves releases and

14

that there’s something untoward going on here, he, frankly,

15

owes an apology to people.

16

Next, Your Honor, as if this wasn’t bad enough,

17

Washington then claims as to both Mr. Kesselman and Dr.

18

Landau, and I quote, “Even if they themselves did not

19

participate in wrongdoing, they bear at least some modicum

20

of responsibility for directing the actions and setting the

Your Honor, I need to choose my

13

words very carefully, because this is really primarily a

14

Skadden Arps, you know, civil and criminal sort of experts

15

thing.

16

somebody from Skadden to please correct me if I misspeak.

17

First of all, all of the company’s lawyers have

19

open as they work on and review and produce tens and

20

hundreds of millions of pages of documents so that if there

21

are issues of wrongdoing of any remaining employees that

22

come to light, those are to be immediately brought to the

23

attention of the Special Committee.

24
25

Secondly,

Your Honor, we, and I personally, have

told and advised and requested of all of our creditor groups

4

collectively the estate has paid probably well over a

5

hundred million dollars for, that if anyone comes to their

6

attention as being likely or potential wrongdoer, that that

7

also must immediately be brought to the Special Committee.

Third, Your Honor, in connection with the KERP
motion of course, a yet additional layer of review is now

10

being done.

11

we actually -- it was consensual from the start, the

12

standard in all of the compensation motions that if it came

13

to light that any employee triggered either of the two

14

prongs of the standard -- which I don’t want to state from

15

memory because I would get it slightly wrong.

there is a disgorgement obligation.

topic and on the work plan and the structure and the

Even though you’re the

MR. HUEBNER:

I’m just asking you as to

I

don’t believe that -- primarily it would be Skadden and

10

involved in the detailing of opioids in the pre-2018 era who

11

were still employed with the company, where they believed

12

that the conduct was problematic.

13

the KERP orders, Your Honor, we could not allow someone to

14

get or keep their 2019 and 2020 KERPs, which it came to our

15

attention that we believed that they violated the standard.

16

And so people were all made aware of that in blazing

technicolor.

to the Special Committee’s attention.

We also, with respect to indemnification, Your

it and form a view that they believe that they are, you

So there are a whole bunch of checks and balances

that the NCSG over the last couple of years has sort of

4

know, you need someone to run the company, you need people

judgment of the Compensation Committee and the Board was

paying the CEO somewhat below median market compensation.

8

And of course it’s really much more below median when you

consider the payment terms now, which are highly unfavorable

and highly atypical and also turn into sort of a multi-month

retention plan and a multi-year retention plan with the

22

frankly, I thought his answers were quite helpful in showing

23

exactly what types of things were done to ensure that these

24

were incentivizing.

25

They didn’t depose anybody to my

They did ask a few questions of Mr. Lowne.

And,

So let me just quickly scan what is in the record

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 91
1

on this, as it is very important I think for all parties.

2

All parties deserve comfort that people are being paid to do

3

their jobs and do them appropriately in a way that hopefully

4

pays for itself many times over and maximizes value.

5

So Mr. Lowne’s sworn testimony is that the metrics

6

are “ambitious, having threshold hard targets that are

7

difficult to achieve both individually and when considered

8

in combination”.

9

He testified that achieving the metrics requires “Diligent

It’s just uncontested testimony.

Right?

10

and committed efforts” and that at the time of their

11

approval by the Board, the metrics were “Challenging,

12

require extensive achievement, and presented a meaningful

13

risk of not being met,” even at the threshold.

14

actually not surprising at all that as we sit here much

15

farther into the year, as the evidence also makes clear,

16

some are not being met.

17

18

And it’s just not what the

2

It’s just not.

Your Honor, strangely enough, the U.S. Trustee in

And among other things, Purdue is getting smaller,

11

which is one of the reasons that some of the numbers are

getting lower.

13

But other metrics are getting higher.

You know,

14

where products or companies or divisions are (indiscernible)

15

better than expected, those metrics are higher than last

Similarly, Your Honor, I think Mr. Lowne already

This was

So all these changes just show that we keep

5

refining the plan as the years go by to best match the

7

The last issue, Your Honor, is the question of

8

timing of approval, which it’s sort of like déjà vu all over

9

again.

We just keep having the same argument and the Court

10

keeps ruling, and then we just keep seeing that argument

11

again in the next pleading.

12

really understand it.

13

And I just -- I just don’t

The notion that the post-emergence board should

deal with the 2021 compensation plan is just completely

misguided.

You need to sort of finish up

You know, we filed this rather late in the year

10

and we adjourned it multiple times specifically to get

11

broader creditor support and to give us time to negotiate

12

and make the multiple very material concessions that I

13

described before that were done at the request of creditors.

14

And more importantly, Your Honor, I only need to ask the

15

Court to look at Pages 55-58 of the Court’s own ruling from

16

the July 29, 2021 KERP Hearing, because this exact argument

17

verbatim was made six weeks ago and for the, I think, sixth

18

time or so, the Court ruled on it and found that the timing

19

of the motions, which actually came very late in the year,

20

and then their actual hearing, which was held even far later

21

yet in the year, precisely to allow for appropriate

22

commercial negotiations and concessions in no way detracted

23

from the propriety of the programs or their timing but, in

24

fact, supported them.

2

THE COURT:

Yes, Your Honor.

So, you agree, I guess, that “base

3

salary” is not a transfer to induce someone to remain with

4

the Debtor’s business, right?

5
6

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Yes, Your Honor, it’s very

complicated.

7

THE COURT:

Because if you’re not paid a salary,

8

obviously you will leave because you’re not being paid.

9

that’s not what Congress had in mind, right?

10

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I believe what they had in mind

11

was, as we indicated, bonuses, awards, things above a

12

person’s base salary.

13

THE COURT:

But

Well, that’s two different things,

14

right?

15

think, really was focusing on -- can be a bonus to stay,

16

i.e., the practice that developed now many years ago where

17

debtors sought stay bonuses for executives simply, you know,

18

that they hadn’t awarded before -- bonuses had not gotten --

19

executives had not gotten such payments before the

20

bankruptcy, and the rationale for the bonus was that it was

21

hard to work in a bankruptcy environment and so, therefore,

22

they should have this increase.

23

Because a bonus -- and this is what Congress, I

But the evidence is really quite clear in this

24

matter, as it has been when compensation levels for 2019-

25

2020 were sought, that the actual compensation for

Page 99
1

executives of these companies for decades included a

2

contingent payment as well as a “base salary”.

3

only when you have both of those together, as the evidence

4

shows, that you actually are in the median for your

5

competitors.

And it was

6

To me, that doesn’t seem like the type of bonus,

7

retention bonus, that Congress is addressing in 503(c)(1).

8

To me, it seems like a payment that is, yes, it’s required

9

by people to be competitive and not to go somewhere else but

10

it’s essentially part of their salary.

11

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

12

THE COURT:

Your Honor --

Do you have any cases or legislative

13

history to support otherwise?

That in a context like this,

14

as opposed to where someone gets something that they had

15

never gotten before and it was tied to just staying in place

16

in the bankruptcy case -- but, rather, an element of

17

compensation that had always been there and is necessary to

18

make you in the median for people in your industry.

19

somehow a bonus, as opposed to a risk you’re taking that you

20

won’t get enough to be in the median?

21

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

That’s

Well, Your Honor, I’m looking

22

at the section -- or the statute and it says transfers.

23

we believe this is a transfer.

24

up with that.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

So,

And that’s where we’ve come

But so is a base salary.

salary.

2

actually running the risk with the portion of the

3

compensation to get to the middle, i.e., that you don’t meet

4

the targets, to me that doesn’t seem like getting a leg up.

5

It seems like staying in the middle or even risking being

6

before the middle.

7
8

And if you need both to be in the middle and you’re

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Well, Your Honor, we believe

you don’t get to (c)(3) until you’ve passed the (c)(1) test.

9

THE COURT:

I understand.

But how is the (c)(1)

10

test applicable to these facts?

11

if someone is getting what I would view as a true bonus just

12

to hang around or just to do their job, that they haven’t

13

gotten in the past but they’re getting it now in a

14

bankruptcy case -- because, as courts were told in the ‘90s,

15

before this statute was enacted, you’ve got to incentivize

16

them, Judge, because it’s really hard on the bankruptcy case

17

-- I understand your point completely.

18

the statute addresses.

19

I understand clearly that

I think that’s what

I’m having a very hard time seeing how it

20

addresses a situation where the evidence shows that this is

21

-- this is actually necessary to get them to the middle of

22

compensation and that the so-called base salary is way below

23

the middle.

24
25

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Your Honor, two responses:

One, I guess I’ll harken back to what Mr. Huebner has said.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 101
1

The timing of the payments was put out to now June 30th to

2

ensure that they get or stick around until post-emergence.

3

So, that --

4

THE COURT:

Well, clearly, that’s something that

5

people want, is that they’ll stick around.

6

true.

7

another risk, another burden on the employee, right?

That is true.

8

That’s fair.

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Yes, that’s

But that just puts

Well, I think the fact that

9

they’re being timed that way because they stick around is

10

another evidence or demonstration that they are retention

11

payments.

12

And, second, Your Honor, we’re turning to the

13

chart that I went over with Mr. Lowne -- it appears they’re

14

going to get a bonus for everything except for one, or an

15

award for everything.

16

ones that they’re not going to meet.

17

later, after the target, they still get an award.

18

seems like these are less incentivizing and more guarantee

19

paid.

20

THE COURT:

And, in fact, he testified are the
If they meet them
So, it

I agree with you to some extent.

I

21

think that the targets are incentivizing, but the threshold,

22

notwithstanding Ms. Gartrell’s testimony that this is also

23

common in the industry -- in fact, usually the threshold can

24

be lower -- is more akin to, you know, not as hard an

25

achievement.

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 102
1

But, again, if the -- if the outcome is that you

2

get paid what is the median in the industry, with a risk

3

that you don’t get that even because you’re below the target

4

and perhaps even below the threshold, I have a really hard

5

time seeing that that is a bonus.

6

that you get more than your base salary but it’s not a bonus

7

over the people who are working as the head of the

8

equivalent of Rhodes Pharma for some other pharmaceutical

9

company or the CEO of that company.

It’s a bonus in the sense

It’s just -- it doesn’t

But that would make the statute

-- some have said nonsensical if it included salary, base

I think they’re talking about transfers above base

salary.

You can call them bonuses, you can call them awards

22

--

23

THE COURT:

It doesn’t say transfers above base

salary.

25

transfers that include base salary.

212-267-6868

In fact, the language could actually apply to
I don’t think Congress

meant it that way but if you take that meaning of a

transfer, clearly every dollar that you receive is “for the

3

purpose of inducing such person to remain with the Debtor’s

business” -- otherwise you wouldn’t have an HR Department.

5

You wouldn’t have a business.

So, it -- I -- look, I just -- it’s -- it’s easy,

extent, rightly so.

managers, you know, you can actually make more in a

more.

It really was pretty outrageous that

Congress dealt with that.

21

But if someone’s being paid on essentially a

22

combination of flat salary and if you get the metrics,

23

median compensation, it’s hard for me to see that that

24

outrage that Congress reflected in (c)(1) really would

apply.

comparison to what was available to the Special Committee,

to the Department of Justice, which was not produced to us

8

under -- because the Department of Justice, among other

things, objected.

10

Your Honor, at the end of the day, the question is

11

whether or not you establish the culture of a company with a

responsibility that it’s (indiscernible) based.

that is -- that is the fundamental issue here.

19

think they disagree with the underlying premise, which is

20

that Purdue’s culture that existed, you know, through some

21

period in 2017 needed to change -- is whether and what role

Dr. Landau should play in that.

by outside counsel in the criminal investigation and Dr.

not the person to take the lead on this point but, rather,

3

it would ultimately depend upon the board as advised by

counsel.

5
6

What is your response on that point?

As I said, Your Honor, perhaps we were

too narrow.

may have been too narrow but I’m just focusing on him at

this point.

MR. TROOP:

Understood, Your Honor.

So, Your

12

Honor, what’s the best analogy?

13

distinction between being involved in an -- I’m going to use

14

the word investigation or a review (indiscernible) and

15

making clear that that review has to be undertaking, even if

16

you can’t do it yourself for all the reasons the Debtors

17

have articulated, but accepting them as truth for these

18

purposes, it’s still the CEO’s responsibility to say we need

19

to make sure -- we need to make sure that we are reviewing

But I guess what is -- what is your basis for saying that

Clearly, Dr. Landau has not been involved in it

7

and I don’t think there’s any testimony that he directed

some sort of inquiry.

9

ultimately, whether there has been a failure to do it.

10

MR. TROOP:

But the issue is, I guess,

Well, Your Honor, I can only look at

some facts, right, that we have, and those facts are that,

12

to my knowledge, no one’s been disciplined.

13

testimony was that no one was disciplined and no one was

14

fired.

15

THE COURT:

8

MS. IMES:

9

Your Honor, may I be heard?

Okay.
Thank you for hearing me, Your Honor.

I appreciate that this is the Debtor’s motion, not Dr.

10

Landau’s, but the objectors have challenged both his

11

leadership of Purdue and his integrity.

12

highly principled man who has always been committed to doing

13

the right thing at Purdue, and we just can’t sit by while

14

they make unfounded smears against him, Your Honor.

15

with your indulgence I’d like to address two main points,

16

one of which Mr. Huebner touched upon.

17

And Dr. Landau is a

So,

First of all, there’s no evidence whatsoever to

18

what Mr. Troop just alluded to that somehow his inept or

19

misconduct advanced any wrongdoing.

20

evidence to support that.

21

to link Dr. Landau to the misconduct to which Purdue pled

22

guilty by saying that he bears responsibility for directing

23

actions and setting a culture that resulted in a decades’

24

long series of felonies.

25

There’s not a shred of

Similarly, Washington is trying

Yet, number one, Dr. Landau has testified under

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 115
1

oath twice, once at his 2004 deposition where anyone

2

could’ve asked him any question they wanted to in this case,

3

and once before Congress that he did not participate in and

4

was not aware of that criminal activity.

5

Your Honor, it’s in the testimony that’s attached to the

6

Nonconsenting State group’s motion at Page 85, 87 and 91.

7

And this is --

Secondly, the timeframe for the criminal conduct

8

that Purdue admitted to in its 2020 guilty plea preceded Dr.

9

Landau’s onboarding as CEO of Purdue.

The long and short of

10

it, Your Honor, is that he was not CEO during the period of

11

(indiscernible) conduct.

12

of time, he worked at a separate company, Purdue Canada in

13

Canada.

14

And for four years of that period

So, there’s not a single action that he directed

15

that resulted in the committing of felonies.

16

they’ve alluded to a decades’ long series of felonies, I

17

gather they’re referring that to the 2007 plea.

18

Honor should know about that is that Dr. Landau had no

19

responsibility for the sales and marketing functions at this

20

time, and he had no involvement with any of the conduct at

21

issue in the 2007 criminal plea.

22

alleged occurred before July 2001, when he had been working

23

as a junior employee in the R&D for less than two years.

24

So, there’s just no truth at all to the aspersions they’re

25

trying to cast upon Dr. Landau.

212-267-6868

Also, since

That conduct that was

Page 116

The second point I wanted to address, Your Honor,

2

was the one that you raised about the culture needing to

3

change.

4

allegations was that somehow Dr. Landau set the culture of

5

the company that enabled this criminal activity.

6

again, that’s just completely false.

7

Landau has done is he’s been a problem-solver and a change

8

agent.

9

that he has done to change the culture and business of

10

One of the things Washington talked about in its

Purdue.

11

Your Honor, much of this is set out in the written

12

statement that Dr. Landau presented to Congress in December

13

of 2020 at Page 2-3 and 4-5, and there’s a link to that

14

referenced in Mr. Huebner’s brief.

15

things he’s done for the company since becoming CEO in June

16

of 2017 are the following things:

17

But among the many

First, he ended the company’s promotion of opioids

18

by sales reps to prescribers, and he did this without being

19

asked to do so or directed by anyone, including regulators.

20

Two, he eliminated the company’s entire opioid

address specific elements of the opioid crisis, namely, the

2

approval and availability of buprenorphine and naloxone; the

3

development of an over-the-counter version of intranasal

4

naloxone, and the development of injectable minalfene.

5

These are obviously all important to NewCo as well.

6

And since September 2019, he’s paid a crucial role

7

in driving workforce productivity, maintaining employee

8

morale, limiting attrition as much as possible, and even

9

recruiting new talent.

10

So, Your Honor, there’s just absolutely no truth

11

to the notion -- and it is merely someone’s notion -- that

12

somehow Dr. Landau was part of or contributed to a corrupt

13

culture that promoted wrongdoing.

14

It’s just not so.

And one final point, Your Honor, is that --

15

unrelated to what I was just talking about -- is that -- and

16

this follows up on a conversa -- question you were asking

17

Dr. Lowne about diversity and so on.

18

that Dr. Landau created the Presidential Committee on

19

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion at the company over a year

20

ago, and that he communicated that as a high priority for

21

the company.

22

It’s my understanding

As for the alleged failure for Dr. Landau to

23

conduct an investigation, I think Mr. Huebner addressed that

24

and made the critical points and I gather that Your Honor

25

has followed up on those observations.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

Unless you have any

516-608-2400

Page 118
1

questions, Your Honor, I have nothing else.

2

THE COURT:

3

MR. HUEBNER:

No, that’s fine.

Thank you.

Your Honor, a few quick things from

4

my end, and I will be pretty brief.

Your Honor, first with

5

respect to the United States Trustee, candidly, if Mr.

6

Schwartzberg believed that the many conclusion in our four

7

declarations were not sufficiently supported or granular,

8

then he probably should have asked for a deposition because

9

that’s what someone does when they think that a witness can

10

be sort of like, knocked over by incisive questioning.

11

The fact that he asked Mr. Lowne to recite a

12

series of highly specific numbers from memory with no prior

13

notice in open court I really don’t think provides any

14

support whatsoever to any sort of argument that these -- the

15

conclusions that these are ambitious, challenging, real

16

targets gets trammeled in any way whatsoever.

17

The second, Your Honor, and you said it now at

18

about five hearings.

19

which I’m glad to say I don’t think I ever participated,

20

where people got big extra bonuses in Chapter 11.

21

not this and has never been this.

22

compensation that’s been going on for 30 years, split into a

23

part paid biweekly as base salary and a part that is

24

essentially deferred and put at risk to get them to median

25

comp if it goes as expected.

212-267-6868

There was a very tawdry world, in

That is

This is regular annual

It’s not extra, it’s not new,

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 119

it’s not bonuses, it’s not retention, except for one thing.

2

And you want to talk about returning bad -- good for bad --

3

it’s just completely unbelievable that we were originally

4

going to make these payments essentially, you know, in March

5

of 2022, as has been done for decades.

6

creditor groups said, no.

7

June because we want buy one, get one free.

8

have to hold them until July 1st.

And three of our

We don’t want you to pay it until
We also want to

9

And now the Trustee is saying because we agreed to

10

accommodate the needs of our priority economic stakeholders,

11

this is now an illegal retention plan?

You know what, Your

12

Honor?

If people would like

13

us to go back to paying it in March exactly as we proposed,

14

we would be delighted to.

15

unlawful because we made a concession to creditors to

16

benefit the estate and increase its value, I mean, it’s just

17

-- you can’t even make this stuff up.

18

I’ll make the offer right now.

But to say that it’s been made

Your Honor, with respect to Mr. Troop’s comments,

19

I just -- I found myself bewildered as he was talking.

20

Because, essentially, he actually did testify incorrectly at

21

great length about what Purdue, and the board, and the

22

Special Committee has done and not done, which was not in

23

his two-page objection that said one thing only, which is

24

Dr. Landau did not oversee investigations or personally fire

25

or discipline people.

212-267-6868

And somehow out of the blue we’re in

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 120
1

a referendum on whether the culture of Purdue has

2

sufficiently turned over.

3

So, let me be very clear because this is actually

4

-- while inappropriately raised, is actually quite central

5

to everything some of us are trying to accomplish.

6

all, the notion that one person in Customer Service appears

7

to have made one phone call that may not have been okay and

8

that everyone agrees that the company, and the monitor, and

9

the compliance function jumped on instantly, and this is

10

somehow evidence that something is still not right?

11

please.

First of

I mean,

Seriously.

12

Like, to even suggest that in the case of this

13

publicity as evidence of impropriety or a not completely

14

clean culture as opposed to the opposite -- you know, I

15

invite anyone who wants to read every single monitor report,

16

which have been filed exactly on scale, about the

17

extraordinary compliance, and the extraordinary change in

18

culture, and the extraordinary safety ad propriety in so

19

many areas.

20

Second, Mr. Troop has grossly misheard me and

21

misunderstood me, and he repeated it multiple times.

I did

22

not say they’re meeting just today or today for the first

23

time.

3

issues for years, and I already described at some length,

4

because we ended up going very far afield from one objection

5

on one person on one part of their compensation, in

6

connection with things like indemnity, the Special Committee

7

demanded voluminous information from the Debtor’s primary

8

law firms to be comfortable that before anybody got

9

indemnified, who was likely to be appropriate.

10

The Special Meeting has been on these

I described to Your Honor, again, impromptu and

11

with some trepidation, the many implicit layers of netting

12

and review that had been in place for a long time.

13

didn’t put the onus in creditors.

14

to all the things we’re doing, if you see anything, then

15

your hundreds of million -- hundred million dollars of legal

16

fees’ worth of review that suggest that a wrongdoer is still

17

at the company, bring it to our attention and we will jump

18

on it right away.

19

people who are highly adversarial to the old Purdue and with

20

very good reason, and had every incentive in the world to

21

help us all ensure that no wrongdoers remain at the company.

It’s an additional layer of care for

24

person who was mentioned in a document is still at the

That doesn’t mean that that person was a wrongdoer

Your Honor, at the end of the day, the NCSG,

10

again, very inaptly named, is really the only objector that

11

is making these, I think, really dangerous and unfounded,

unexpected claims that somehow the culture of the company

13

has not been sufficiently changed.

is basically Mr. Clean with years of government service at

13

He is where he is supposed

And we have nothing that I think -- you know,

14

what’s presented today that comes close to suggesting that

15

paying basically below median compensation for the five

16

people who have worked so hard to preserve the actual value

17

with the cash balance of a billion dollars should not be

18

approved.

That’s all I have, Your Honor.

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

21

Okay, thank you.
Your Honor, Paul Schwartzberg.

Could I make two quick points, Your Honor?

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

23

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

The first, Your Honor, you had

24

some questions regarding salary and 503(c).

25

to point out, Your Honor, that salary is referenced in

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I just wanted

516-608-2400

Page 124
1

503(b) and then 503(c) the indicates, notwithstanding

2

Subsection B.

3

So, I wanted to point that out, Your Honor.

And, second, Mr. Huebner had asserted that we did

4

not provide any evidence, but I just wanted to also point

5

out that we did file an objection that indicated for, among

6

other things, there was no historical information.

And the

7

Debtors filed a response and it didn’t include it.

And

8

that’s why we had to cross Mr. Lowne today, Your Honor.

9

THE COURT:

All right.

Well, the Debtors do have

10

the burden of proof but notwithstanding the resources of

11

your office, there are such things as depositions.

12

Okay, I’m assuming that that closes oral argument.

13

I have before me a motion by the Debtors to obtain approval

14

of their 2021 Key Employee Incentive Plan, which would apply

15

to five current employees of the Debtors that would qualify

16

as insiders under the Bankruptcy Code.

17

in Section 503(c)(1) establishes an extraordinarily

18

difficult, if not de facto, impossible standard that must be

19

met before a Debtor may make a transfer to or incur an

20

obligation for the benefit of an insider of the Debtor for

21

the purpose of inducing such person to remain with the

22

Debtor’s business.

23

The Bankruptcy Code

11 USC, Section 503(c)(1).

That subsection is premised by the phrase:

24

Notwithstanding Subsection B, there shall neither be allowed

25

nor paid -- and then the language that I just quoted.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

Mr.

516-608-2400

Page 125
1

Schwartzberg for the U.S. Trustee is correct that 503(b)(1)

2

includes as an administrative expense wages, salaries and

3

commissions for services rendered after the commencement of

4

the case.

5

notwithstanding Section B, which would seem to indicate that

6

if one read the provision as broadly as I think the U.S.

7

Trustee might be trying to, it would not even -- it would

8

apply even to and notwithstanding the allowance of wages,

9

salaries and commissions if they fit into a transfer made

But, again, 503(c) is introduced by

10

for the purpose of inducing a person who was an insider to

11

remain with the Debtor’s business.

12

The courts have not adopted that interpretation of

13

Section 503(c)(1), largely because it makes no sense, but

14

also because they have recognized almost since the enactment

15

of 503(c)(1) that all payments to employees and executives

16

included within that definition have some retentive effect.

17

Obviously, if you don’t receive wages, salaries and

18

commissions or if you’re not paid market rates, then

19

generally you will, as soon as you can, leave the employ of

20

your employer and find a better paying job or a more

21

satisfying job elsewhere.

And therefore they seek allowance or

approvals, rather, of the KEIP under 503(c)(3), which

they are not justified by the facts and circumstances of the

Otherwise, because they would be out of the

standard applied under Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy

Code, i.e., whether the proposed transfer or obligation is a

proper exercise of business judgment.

Judge Lifland asked whether the program sufficiently

answered the following questions in deciding whether it made

good business sense to approve it:

20

First.

Is there a reasonable relationship between

21

the plan proposed and the results to be obtained -- i.e.,

22

will the employee be properly incentivized?

23

calculated to achieve the desired performance?

Second.

reasonable?

Does it apply to all employees?

Fourth.

Does it

Is the plan proposal consistent with

industry standards?

7

Five.

What were the due diligence efforts of the

8

Debtor in investigating the need for a plan, analyzing which

9

key employees need to be incentivized?

10

What is available?

What is generally applicable in the particular industry?

And, last, did the Debtor receive independent

counsel in performing due diligence and in creating and

authorizing the incentive compensation.

The motion clearly has a context that could be, in

many respects, viewed as law of the case, although they

21

filed their petitions late in 2019 and the metrics for a Kay

22

Employee Incentive Program would generally be set in the

23

early part of the year, i.e., in early 2019. The Debtors in

24

2019, after their petition date, sought approval of the 2019

25

program which would largely apply retroactively since by

updated and addressed on a yearly basis to reflect the

3

Debtor’s circumstances as they evolve each year and,

4

therefore, in 2020, the Debtors also sought approval of the

5

2020 KEIP program and did so again in the fall of that year.

6

They have done so again for the 2021 program seeking

7

approval at the end of September, even though the company

developed the metrics for the program in early 2021 for 2021

10

These plans are

18

as opposed to having a substantial portion of it paid in

calendar year 2021, as was the case with the prior awards

20

for the year in which they were earned.

25

extension.

212-267-6868

The Debtors have agreed not to seek to assume

Page 130
1

any of the employment contracts of any of the 2021 KEIP

2

participants, therefore, not locking in those contracts as

3

part of the plan process.

4

And, lastly, Debtors have agreed to consult with

5

the Ad Hoc Committee of States and Other Governmental

6

Entities, the Multistate Governmental Group and the

7

Unsecured Creditors Committee with respect to measuring

8

corporate performance against the 2021 corporate metrics, a

9

function that would normally be performed solely by the

10

Compensation Committee and ultimately the board based on

11

presentations by management as to compliance or performance

12

compliance with the metrics.

13

And, further, have agreed that those committees

14

will consult with the Debtors in developing performance

15

metrics for calendar year 2022, although the normal time

16

when one would do that in February of 2022 may not come

17

before the effective date of the Chapter 11 plan.

18

All of those measures, as I said, are to the

19

detriment of the executives in that they delay their payment

20

and make their right to access to the long-term payment

21

subject to a more lengthy claw-back period.

22

amounts are also premised upon the reductions in the prior

23

years’ KEIP programs, which aggregate approximately $4.8

24

million of reductions across the board.

The Court heard testimony by two parties, two

Josephine

2

Gartrell and Mr. Lowne, who submitted two declarations in

support of the motion.

testified at the two earlier hearings on the 2019 and 2020

5

KEIP program, where the United States Trustee made almost

6

exactly the same objection.

Both of them had also previously

7

Based on my review of that testimony and

8

especially the testimony in the current witness declarations

9

as well as the live testimony today by Ms. Gartrell and Mr.

10

Lowne, it appears to me that the Debtors have carried their

11

burden of proof to show, first, that the proposed KEIP is

12

not the type of retentive bonus program that Congress had in

13

mind in 503(c)(1) and that the KEIP was designed to be

14

consistent with, although provide materially less

15

compensation than, the roughly three decades of compensation

16

history that these Debtors provided to their executives.

17

And, more importantly, was designed to enable these five

18

employees to be compensated on an aggregate basis, including

19

the KEIP, at median compensation rates compared to their

20

company’s competitors or the Debtor’s competitors.

21

That testimony by Ms. Gartrell was unchallenged

22

and credible.

23

the base salary of four of the five people covered by the

24

KEIP, that base salary is well-below, dramatically below in

25

fact, median compensation in the Debtor’s industry.

212-267-6868

The record is clear that when one looks at

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 132
1

percent below the 25th percentile.

2

With the KEIP, if the target metrics are met, the

3

compensation for those four executives, including the fifth

4

one, the company’s general counsel, will be at median.

5

company’s general counsel is being paid well in excess of

6

media compensation, but no one has challenged his

7

compensation, and I believe rightly so given the evidence

8

before me and the evidence from the prior hearings in 2019

9

and 2020, which reflect the fact which is throughout these

The

10

cases -- I believe an obvious one, that his role as general

11

counsel is far more complex and difficult than general

12

counsel of a competitor in this industry, given the myriad

13

complex legal issues that, as general counsel, he needs to

14

deal with.

These payments, again, if the target is met, will

lead to median compensation in the industry.

18

payment, notwithstanding the fact, as Ms. Gartrell has

testified, that it is common practice in the industry to

21

the target.

22

reduced based on a right to get some payment between 75 and

100 percent for meeting metrics in part but not in whole,

24

So, ultimately, what the KEIP enables

is the opportunity to bring aggregate compensation for these

2

five individuals up to the median in their industry.

No doubt my ruling will be construed by some as

authorizing large bonuses to executives.

I do not believe

that that is, in fact, the case here.

That structure of a KEIP Ms. Gartrell testified

14

to, again without any cross or contravention, is a typical

15

structure in the industry.

16

to her testimony, often goes all the way down to 50 percent

brought out thoroughly in that record, although I was well

aware of it beforehand, given the Court's approval of the

Debtors' November 2020 civil and criminal settlement with

5

the United States, that the culture, the corporate culture

6

of Purdue was sick, was in -- simply not the type of

7

corporate culture that a corporation should have.

8

It is important, obviously, to change that

9

culture, and there is considerable evidence in the record

10

that, in fact, under Dr. Landau's leadership such changes

11

have taken place, including the pre-petition termination of

12

the opioid sales force, the end of detailing, and the like.

13

The Debtors' Board was also substantially changed with the

appointment of an independent Special Committee that had

extraordinary power, and the appointment post-petition of a

terminated because of their improper conduct in the period

4

before he became CEO, or even thereafter; although, they

5

have not really identified any improper conduct of any

employee that arose thereafter.

7

The Debtors have quite cogently pointed out that

8

because Dr. Landau was himself named as a defendant in some

9

complaints against Purdue and the Sacklers, pre-petition,

10

albeit that he strongly denies the claims that were asserted

11

against him in that litigation, it would have been improper

12

for him to inject himself into the process of determining

13

who acted properly or improperly at Purdue, who was still an

14

employee there.

15

really needs to have been assumed by other parties, whether

16

that would be the Special Committee or outside counsel, as

opposed to by Dr. Landau.

I agree with that argument.

entities, Indian Tribes, representatives of personal injury

Those negotiations were fierce, both among the

creditors and against the Sacklers.

particular group was entitled to most of the value.

They were fierce among

days of oral argument on that Plan, and I've evaluated it

I want to be clear because you have said today as
well as in your pleading, which preceded my ruling, that the

negotiated, but I think thoughtfully negotiated, in large

abatement procedures are intentionally open to people like

yourself and other representatives who live this for input

as to what works or doesn't work.

is what happened for example with the cigarette settlements.

And equally importantly I think, there's reporting often to

That's not my -- that's not what I wanted to do.

People are certainly free to disagree with it.

very difficult situation.

think is the proper context at this point given the evidence

that I've heard and the basis for that ruling.
