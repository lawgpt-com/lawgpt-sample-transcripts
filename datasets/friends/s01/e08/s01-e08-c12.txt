Rachel Green: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Ross Geller: That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel Green: Aww, look at the little thing.
Ross Geller: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler Bing: Who are those people?
Ross Geller: Got me.
Monica Geller: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel Green: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica Geller: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ross Geller: Looks like a fun gang.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross Geller: Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
