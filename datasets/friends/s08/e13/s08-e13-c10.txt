Monica Geller: What do you think you're doing?
Chandler Bing: L-leaving my troubles behind?
Monica Geller: I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
Chandler Bing: Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
Monica Geller: Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!

Chandler Bing: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Chandler Bing: You told her?!
Monica Geller: She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
Monica Geller: I don't think I'd care.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Joey Tribbiani: Hello?
Phoebe Buffay: We're in the bathroom!
Joey Tribbiani: Why?
Chandler Bing: Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
Joey Tribbiani: What are you guys doing in here?
Monica Geller: Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!
Chandler Bing: You like Rachel?!
Joey Tribbiani: It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay: Mazel tov.
Rachel Green: Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
Monica Geller: Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Ross Geller: Hello?
Chandler Bing: Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Ross Geller: Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Rachel Green: No, I was waiting for you!
Phoebe Buffay: Tell us what?
Rachel Green: We're having a girl.
#ALL#: Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
