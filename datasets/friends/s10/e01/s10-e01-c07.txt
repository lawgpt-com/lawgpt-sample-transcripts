Phoebe Buffay: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Precious: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
Phoebe Buffay: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
Precious: My name is Precious.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
Precious: I just can't believe this... Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I don't...
Precious: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
Phoebe Buffay: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
Precious: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Phoebe Buffay: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
Precious: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
Phoebe Buffay: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
Precious: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Phoebe Buffay: Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Precious: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
Precious: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
Phoebe Buffay: You're welcome!
