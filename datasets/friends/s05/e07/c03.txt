Rachel Green: How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Monica Geller: He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Rachel Green: Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Monica Geller: Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.

Danny: Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Monica Geller: Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel Green: I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Danny: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Danny: Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Monica Geller: Ohh, fun!
Rachel Green: Ohh, great!
Danny: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Danny: Okay, see ya.
Monica Geller: Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Rachel Green: Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Monica Geller: And you're not gonna do that.
Rachel Green: That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Monica Geller: So-so there is no party.
Rachel Green: No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Monica Geller: I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Rachel Green: Exactly.
