Joey Tribbiani: Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
Chandler Bing: And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Here goes.
Chandler Bing: What's the matter?
Joey Tribbiani: I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Chandler Bing: I understand.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Chandler Bing: I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Chandler Bing: Well, I can't do it either.
Monica Geller: Hey! Did you find them?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Chandler Bing: We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Monica Geller: Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
