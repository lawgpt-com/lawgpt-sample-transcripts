Rachel Green: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey.
Rachel Green: You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Ross Geller: Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
Rachel Green: I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Ross Geller: I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
Rachel Green: I would-Sequoia?
Ross Geller: Veto.
Rachel Green: Fine.
Ross Geller: Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
Rachel Green: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Ross Geller: Not like this!
