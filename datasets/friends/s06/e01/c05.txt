Phoebe Buffay: Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
Joey Tribbiani: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Joey Tribbiani: All right. All right.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Joey Tribbiani: Really? I don't...
Phoebe Buffay: Sing!!
Joey Tribbiani: I wanna rock and roll all night!
