Monica Geller: Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Joey Tribbiani: You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Monica Geller: So?!
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Monica Geller: Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh right, right.
Monica Geller: I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Joey Tribbiani: Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Monica Geller: It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
