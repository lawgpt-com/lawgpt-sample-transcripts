Rachel Green: So did you read your evaluation yet?
Tag Jones: No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Rachel Green: Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
Tag Jones: A joke they would appreciate?

Rachel Green: Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Tag Jones: No, not my touchie.
Rachel Green: Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
