Monica Geller: Hey, how did the audition go?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
Monica Geller: What happened?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
Monica Geller: So far so good!
Chandler Bing: Honey, I'm old!
Monica Geller: What's wrong?
Chandler Bing: I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Monica Geller: So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
Chandler Bing: Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
Joey Tribbiani: Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
Monica Geller: What are they?
Chandler Bing: They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Joey Tribbiani: I give you $ 500 for them!
Chandler Bing: What am I supposed to do with these?
Monica Geller: Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
Chandler Bing: Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
Monica Geller: Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Chandler Bing: No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
