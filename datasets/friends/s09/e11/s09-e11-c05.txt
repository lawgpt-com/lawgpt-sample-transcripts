Phoebe Buffay: Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
Joey Tribbiani: Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
Director: Okay, okay, okay! You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, now. What?
Director: And...Action!!
Director: Cut! Cut!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Director: Well, don't be.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, that helps.
Director: And...Action!
Director: Cut!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.
Director: And...Action!
