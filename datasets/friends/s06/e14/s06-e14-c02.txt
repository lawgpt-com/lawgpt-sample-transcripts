Rachel Green: Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Ross Geller: Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Rachel Green: Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"

Rachel Green: She asked-asked you out again?
Ross Geller: Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
