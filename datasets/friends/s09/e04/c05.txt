Mike Hannigan: Sure who are you?
Ross Geller: I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Mike Hannigan: Oh.
Ross Geller: yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Mike Hannigan: Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
Ross Geller: No.
Mike Hannigan: oh it's just you have that look.
Ross Geller: Damn super cuts!
Mike Hannigan: what's up is Phoebe ok?
Ross Geller: oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Mike Hannigan: that's why she was weird.
Ross Geller: yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Mike Hannigan: I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house.
Ross Geller: well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Mike Hannigan: hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Ross Geller: of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Mike Hannigan: but you did say it.
Ross Geller: yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-a-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Mike Hannigan: Vicrum?
Ross Geller: WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
