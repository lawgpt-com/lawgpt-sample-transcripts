Chandler Bing: So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Gary: I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Chandler Bing: Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Gary: Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Monica Geller: What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Monica Geller: Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Phoebe Buffay: You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Monica Geller: Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Monica Geller: Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Chandler Bing: Uh, yeah.
Monica Geller: Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Chandler Bing: Why?
Monica Geller: 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Chandler Bing: Ohh, so?
Monica Geller: So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Chandler Bing: Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
