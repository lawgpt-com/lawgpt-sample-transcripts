Joey Tribbiani: Yeah?
Chandler Bing: Phoebe knows about us!
Joey Tribbiani: Well I didn't tell them!
Monica Geller: Them?! Who's them?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica Geller: Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Chandler Bing: Oh man!
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Monica Geller: Unless...
Joey Tribbiani: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Monica Geller: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Chandler Bing: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
