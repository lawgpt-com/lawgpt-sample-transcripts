Joey Tribbiani: What are you doing?
Ross Geller: I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Joey Tribbiani: Why are you doing this?
Ross Geller: Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Ross Geller: Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Ross Geller: So what, we just sit?
Joey Tribbiani: Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
