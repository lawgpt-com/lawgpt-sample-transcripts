Rachel Green: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Rachel Green: What's up?!
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Rachel Green: Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Phoebe Buffay: No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Rachel Green: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Rachel Green: With Ross and Jill?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Rachel Green: With Ross and my sister?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Rachel Green: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Oh there is no way.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay then.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Phoebe Buffay: But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
