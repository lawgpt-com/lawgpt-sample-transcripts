Monica Geller: Hi.. how was the game?
Ross Geller: Well..
#ALL#: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Monica Geller: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Joey Tribbiani: Alan.
Ross Geller: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Rachel Green: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Chandler Bing: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Monica Geller: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Ross Geller: What?
Monica Geller: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Rachel Green: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Ross Geller: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Chandler Bing: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
