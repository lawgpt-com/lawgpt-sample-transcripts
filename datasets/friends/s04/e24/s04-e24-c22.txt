Chandler Bing: We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Monica Geller: I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?

Ross Geller: Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Stephen Waltham: No.
Andrea Waltham: You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Stephen Waltham: We've come for her things.
Ross Geller: Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Stephen Waltham: She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Andrea Waltham: We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Stephen Waltham: Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Andrea Waltham: Oh yes, there you are.
Rachel Green: Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Stephen Waltham: Goodbye Geller.
Ross Geller: Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Stephen Waltham: All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Andrea Waltham: Call me.
Stephen Waltham: You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
