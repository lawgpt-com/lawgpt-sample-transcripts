Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Monica Geller: Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, they're not coming.
Monica Geller: What?!
Joey Tribbiani: Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Monica Geller: Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Joey Tribbiani: Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Monica Geller: Oh Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Monica Geller: No she hasn't.
Joey Tribbiani: Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Monica Geller: Well, what am I going to say?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Monica Geller: Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
