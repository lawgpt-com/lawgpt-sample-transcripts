Eddie Menuek: That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
Chandler Bing: What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Eddie Menuek: That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Chandler Bing: Well it's not Sean Penn.
Eddie Menuek: Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
