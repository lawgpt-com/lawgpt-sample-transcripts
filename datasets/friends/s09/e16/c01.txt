Chandler Bing: Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Monica Geller: I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Chandler Bing: I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Monica Geller: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
Chandler Bing: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Monica Geller: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Chandler Bing: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Monica Geller: Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Chandler Bing: No! We're not borrowing money.
Monica Geller: Why not?
Chandler Bing: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Monica Geller: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Chandler Bing: That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
