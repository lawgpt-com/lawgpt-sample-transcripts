Monica Geller: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Chandler Bing: Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Phoebe Buffay: How can you not know which one?
Rachel Green: I mean that's unbelievable.
Monica Geller: I mean, was it Gina?
Ross Geller: Which one is Gina?
Rachel Green: Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Monica Geller: No, no, no, that's Dina.
Chandler Bing: You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Phoebe Buffay: We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Chandler Bing: Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Monica Geller: That was me.
Chandler Bing: Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Monica Geller: That's okay.
Rachel Green: That's all right.
Ross Geller: That's okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Can I talk to you for a second?!
Ross Geller: Hey, Joey.
Rachel Green: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on!!
Chandler Bing: Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Joey Tribbiani: I just got off the phone with my sister.
Ross Geller: Ah, which, which one?
Joey Tribbiani: Mary-Angela.
Ross Geller: Mary-Angela.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Y'know which one was she again?
Joey Tribbiani: Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Chandler Bing: It's gotta be the first one.
Joey Tribbiani: Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Chandler Bing: Yep, I'm in a tree.
