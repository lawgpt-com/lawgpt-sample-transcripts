Rachel Green: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Rachel Green: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Ross Geller: What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Rachel Green: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Ross Geller: What?! Over a stupid room!
Rachel Green: Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Ross Geller: Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
