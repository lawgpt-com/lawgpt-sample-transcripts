Chandler Bing: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought "who better then a minister to raise a child!"
Monica Geller: Amen.
Chandler Bing: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica Geller: Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
Monica Geller: It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica: Wow.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, wow.
Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica Geller: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Erica: Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Chandler Bing: No-ot for me it doesn't.
Agency Guy: So, how's everything going in here?
Erica: We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Agency Guy: Do you have any question for Erica?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Agency Guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.
Chandler Bing: You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Agency Guy: Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Erica: Actually, I don't think we have to.
Monica Geller: We don't?
Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
Monica Geller: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I did.
Monica Geller: Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
