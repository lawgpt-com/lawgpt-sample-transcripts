Ross Geller: Hey.
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Ross Geller: You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Monica Geller: Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Ross Geller: Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Monica Geller: Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Chandler Bing: Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
Monica Geller: What are you talking about?
Chandler Bing: That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Monica Geller: What!? You faked it?
Ross Geller: You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.
