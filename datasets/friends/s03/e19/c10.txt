Ross Geller: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Chandler Bing: You didn't just break up.
Ross Geller: Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Chandler Bing: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!

Chandler Bing: Okay.
Ross Geller: She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
