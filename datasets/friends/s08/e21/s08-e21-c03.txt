Monica Geller: Joey! Now that you're here...
Joey Tribbiani: Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?
Chandler Bing: I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Joey Tribbiani: I thought you already have a job.
Chandler Bing: And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Chandler Bing: That's what I do now.
Monica Geller: Hey Joey, come taste this.
Joey Tribbiani: What is it?
Monica Geller: Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
Joey Tribbiani: You cooked him?
Monica Geller: No. He Teaches A Course On Food Criticism At The New School, So Before We Go To The Movies I Wanna Go By There And Make Him Try My Bouillabaisse Again. Oh, I Cannot Wait To Read The Front Page Of The Post Tomorrow! "Restaurant Reviewer Admits I was wrong about Monica."
Chandler Bing: The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
