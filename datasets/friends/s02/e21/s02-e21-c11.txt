Big Bully: Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Ross Geller: Yes, and that's why we're here.
Chandler Bing: Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Little Bully: Let's do this alright.
Ross Geller: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Little Bully: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Chandler Bing: Alright, let's do this.
Little Bully: Alright.
Chandler Bing: Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Ross Geller: Whad'ya mean?
Chandler Bing: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Big Bully: No, you can't use your watch.
Chandler Bing: Ok.
Big Bully: Or your keys.
Chandler Bing: Ok.
Little Bully: Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
Ross Geller: Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Big Bully: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Ross Geller: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Little Bully: Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
