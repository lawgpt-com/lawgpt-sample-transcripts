Rachel Green: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hi.
Rachel Green: Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
Ross Geller: I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here.
Rachel Green: You do?
Ross Geller: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Ross Geller: Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
Rachel Green: Seriously. What?!
Ross Geller: Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Rachel Green: Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
Ross Geller: Oh sure.
Rachel Green: I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that...
