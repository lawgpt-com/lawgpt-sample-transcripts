Phoebe Buffay: After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Monica Geller: Did that!
Phoebe Buffay: Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Monica Geller: Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe Buffay: Was it not pain-free?
Monica Geller: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Phoebe Buffay: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Monica Geller: That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Phoebe Buffay: Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Monica Geller: Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
