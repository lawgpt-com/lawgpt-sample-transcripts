Ross Geller: Pretty soon I guess.
Rachel Green: Yeah. I'm sorry.
Ross Geller: I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Rachel Green: No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Ross Geller: Same difference.
Gate Agent: All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
