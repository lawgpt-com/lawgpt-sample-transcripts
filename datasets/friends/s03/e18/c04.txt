Monica Geller: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Rachel Green: Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Monica Geller: Pete, can I get you something else?
Peter Becker: Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Monica Geller: Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Peter Becker: Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Monica Geller: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Peter Becker: Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Rachel Green: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Monica Geller: I mean really, think about it.
Peter Becker: Ho-ho, I will.
