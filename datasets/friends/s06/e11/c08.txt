Rachel Green: That's funny.
Ross Geller: Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh sure! Noo!
Rachel Green: Ohh!!
Ross Geller: My apothecary table!!!
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Rachel Green: Noooooo!!
Phoebe Buffay: Ross, where did you get this?!
Ross Geller: I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Rachel Green: Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Rachel Green: Oh yes.
Phoebe Buffay: Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Ross Geller: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
