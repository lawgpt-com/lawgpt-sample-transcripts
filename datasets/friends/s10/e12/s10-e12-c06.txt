Phoebe Buffay: Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
Monica Geller: I know. .
Mike Hannigan: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
Mike Hannigan: Orchids?
Phoebe Buffay: Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Joey Tribbiani: Hello Michael.
Mike Hannigan: Joseph.
Joey Tribbiani: May I have a word with you, please?
Mike Hannigan: This is... great...
Joey Tribbiani: Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
Mike Hannigan: Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Joey Tribbiani: More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
Mike Hannigan: Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
Joey Tribbiani: I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Mike Hannigan: Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
Joey Tribbiani: That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
Mike Hannigan: That must have been one lousy movie.
Joey Tribbiani: That was ME!
