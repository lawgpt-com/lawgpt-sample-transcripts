Mike Hannigan: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?
Phoebe Buffay: Sure.
Mike Hannigan: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.
Phoebe Buffay: Why did you go along with that?
Mike Hannigan: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
Phoebe Buffay: That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
Mike Hannigan: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
Phoebe Buffay: Prove it.
Mike Hannigan: There isn't a piano here.
Phoebe Buffay: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Mike Hannigan: nan
Phoebe Buffay: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Mike Hannigan: Really?
Phoebe Buffay: Uhuh.
Mike Hannigan: That's great. What kind of music do you play?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Mike Hannigan: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
Phoebe Buffay: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Mike Hannigan: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
Joey Tribbiani: nan
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
Joey Tribbiani: Look at this. My two best friends!
