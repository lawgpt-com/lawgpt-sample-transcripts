Monica Geller: Hi.
Fake Monica: Hey.
Monica Geller: How are you?
Fake Monica: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Monica Geller: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica: That I was not expecting.
Monica Geller: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica: Oh. Thanks.
Monica Geller: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Fake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica Geller: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Fake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica Geller: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica Geller: Not necessarily...
Fake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Monica Geller: Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?
