Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Any good mail?
Chandler Bing: Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Chandler Bing: "Benefits lapsed."
Joey Tribbiani: Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Chandler Bing: Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Joey Tribbiani: Let me see that!
Chandler Bing: All right.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Joey Tribbiani: All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Chandler Bing: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Joey Tribbiani: ...look both ways before you cross the street.
