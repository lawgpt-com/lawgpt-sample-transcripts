Monica Geller: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Chandler Bing: Ok, ok, here we go.
Monica Geller: Ok.
Chandler Bing: Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
Phoebe Buffay: Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Monica Geller: We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
Phoebe Buffay: Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
Monica Geller: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Phoebe Buffay: No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Monica Geller: That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Phoebe Buffay: We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Monica Geller: That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Phoebe Buffay: City Hall.
Monica Geller: Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Phoebe Buffay: It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding.
Monica Geller: Yay!
Chandler Bing: But you already gave all your money to charity!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I'll just ask for it back!
Chandler Bing: I don't think you can do that!
Monica Geller: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
Chandler Bing: That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
