Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Huh.
Chandler Bing: Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Joey Tribbiani: The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Chandler Bing: That's still in there?!
Joey Tribbiani: Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Chandler Bing: Is this a service you're providing me?
Joey Tribbiani: No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Chandler Bing: Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Joey Tribbiani: So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Chandler Bing: Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani: And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Chandler Bing: Okay...
Joey Tribbiani: Give me $400!
