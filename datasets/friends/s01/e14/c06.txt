Lorraine: You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Joey Tribbiani: Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Janice Litman Goralnik: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Chandler Bing: That's OK.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: We can't do that.
Chandler Bing: What? What can't you do?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, we might be leaving now.
Chandler Bing: Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Joey Tribbiani: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Chandler Bing: Ok, you can not do this to me.
Joey Tribbiani: You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Lorraine: Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Chandler Bing: I hope she throws up on you.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: So...
Janice Litman Goralnik: Just us.
Chandler Bing: Oh, what a crappy night!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Chandler Bing: Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Janice Litman Goralnik: So, do we have the best friends or what?
Chandler Bing: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Janice Litman Goralnik: I will go for that drink.
Chandler Bing: You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Janice Litman Goralnik: Each.
Chandler Bing: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
