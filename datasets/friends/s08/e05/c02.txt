Mr. Franklin: Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
Chandler Bing: You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Mr. Franklin: You're a joker Bing.
Chandler Bing: What's funny about that?

Ross Geller: I'm telling you, I like the food!
Chandler Bing: You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
Bob (Chandler's coworker): Hey Toby! Have a good night.
Ross Geller: Did that guy just call you Toby?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
Ross Geller: Well, why don't you correct him?
Chandler Bing: Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Ross Geller: Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Chandler Bing: No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Ross Geller: Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
Chandler Bing: Shh! It is a family name!
Ross Geller: Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
