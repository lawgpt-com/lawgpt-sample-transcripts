Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Chandler Bing: Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Joey Tribbiani: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Chandler Bing: Well there you go.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Chandler Bing: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Chandler Bing: Weird world. Your kids?
Joey Tribbiani: I figure my character has kids.
Chandler Bing: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Chandler Bing: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Chandler Bing: Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
