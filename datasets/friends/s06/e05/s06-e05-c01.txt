Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: You're kidding!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God!!
Monica Geller: Ross!
Ross Geller: Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Chandler Bing: Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Ross Geller: Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!

Phoebe Buffay: Another lie. You have a sickness!
