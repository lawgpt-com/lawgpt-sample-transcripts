Rachel Green: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Phoebe Buffay: Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Rachel Green: I don't think so.
Phoebe Buffay: Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Rachel Green: All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Rachel Green: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Phoebe Buffay: Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Rachel Green: Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Rachel Green: Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Phoebe Buffay: So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Rachel Green: His new girlfriend!
