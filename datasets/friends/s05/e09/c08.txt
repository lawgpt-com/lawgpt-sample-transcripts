Rachel Green: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Rachel Green: So umm, what's this book about?
Phoebe Buffay: You didn't read this one either?!
Rachel Green: Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Rachel Green: Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Phoebe Buffay: No! You should've read it yourself!
Rachel Green: Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Phoebe Buffay: Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Rachel Green: A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
The Teacher: Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
The Teacher: Well, go ahead Rachel.
Rachel Green: Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
The Teacher: If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Rachel Green: Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
