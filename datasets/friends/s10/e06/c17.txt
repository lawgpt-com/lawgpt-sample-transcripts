Benjamin Hobart: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
Ross Geller: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Benjamin Hobart: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
Ross Geller: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Charlie Wheeler: Benji?
Benjamin Hobart: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Ross Geller: Too little, too late, Benji!
Charlie Wheeler: I can't believe this.
Benjamin Hobart: I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
Ross Geller: No!
Charlie Wheeler: Yes!
Ross Geller: What?
Charlie Wheeler: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
Ross Geller: or...
Benjamin Hobart: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
Charlie Wheeler: Maybe...
Ross Geller: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Charlie Wheeler: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
Benjamin Hobart: I'm sorry too...
Benjamin Hobart: I love you!
Charlie Wheeler: I love you too!
Ross Geller: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
