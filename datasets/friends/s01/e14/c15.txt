Carol Willick: It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Ross Geller: You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Carol Willick: Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Ross Geller: Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Carol Willick: That could be it.
Ross Geller: Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Carol Willick: Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Ross Geller: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.

Carol Willick: Oh, I love you too. But...
Ross Geller: No but, no but.
Carol Willick: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Ross Geller: That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Carol Willick: All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
unknown: nan
Carol Willick: Not her.
