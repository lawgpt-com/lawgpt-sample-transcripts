Monica Geller: Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Chandler Bing: Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Monica Geller: You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Chandler Bing: Kinda. They're really big.
Monica Geller: Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Chandler Bing: No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Monica Geller: Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Chandler Bing: Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Monica Geller: Even with me?
Chandler Bing: I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Monica Geller: Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Chandler Bing: Water! Water! Water!
