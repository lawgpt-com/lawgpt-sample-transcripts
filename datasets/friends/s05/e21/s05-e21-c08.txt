Rachel Green: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Woman No. 1: Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Rachel Green: It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Woman No. 1: Eew! It's creepy looking!
Rachel Green: Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Woman No. 1: No, I hate cats.

Woman No. 2: Wow! What an unusual cat!
Rachel Green: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Woman No. 2: Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Rachel Green: Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Woman No. 2: What?!
Rachel Green: Okay, a thousand.
Woman No. 2: I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Rachel Green: Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Woman No. 2: Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
Rachel Green: Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
