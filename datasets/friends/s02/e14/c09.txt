Chandler Bing: I can't believe it.
Phoebe Buffay: Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Chandler Bing: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Rachel Green: Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Phoebe Buffay: Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Chandler Bing: What am I gonna do, huh?

Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: How come you have two?
Chandler Bing: Well this one's for you.
Joey Tribbiani: Get out.
Chandler Bing: No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Chandler Bing: That's what they'll call us.
