Receptionist: You're late!
Joey Tribbiani: I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
Receptionist: No, Lennart doesn't wait!
Joey Tribbiani: But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Lennart: Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
Joey Tribbiani: Actually, I really need.
Lennart: We must go now, quickly, please.
Joey Tribbiani: Yes... ahahaaa.
Lennart: Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"
Joey Tribbiani: "I think you know!"
Lennart: "Oh, you sick bastard!"
Joey Tribbiani: "I am what you made me! You know what?"
Lennart: "What?"
Joey Tribbiani: "I could go right now."
Lennart: "Then go, go!"
Joey Tribbiani: "I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
Lennart: Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
Joey Tribbiani: I did?
Lennart: Yes. Plus... what you've got that... I don't know what you've got going... this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but you know what? more, more. Can you do that?
Joey Tribbiani: Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Lennart: Look at that: still in character, I like it... I plant seeds I can't explain.
