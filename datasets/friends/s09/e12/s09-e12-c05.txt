Phoebe Buffay: Hey Mikey.
Mike Hannigan: Hey P.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you doing?
Mike Hannigan: Setting rat traps.
Phoebe Buffay: To kill Bob??
Mike Hannigan: No, no, to test his neck strength.
Phoebe Buffay: No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Mike Hannigan: Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
Phoebe Buffay: I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
Mike Hannigan: Better think of a new name for him.
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Mike Hannigan: I don't know, I mean I'm not sure ...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Mike Hannigan: Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Phoebe Buffay: Suzie?
