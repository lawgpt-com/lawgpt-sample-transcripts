Chandler Bing: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Chandler, what are you talking about?
Chandler Bing: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.

Chandler Bing: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
Chandler Bing: I understand.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing.
Chandler Bing: They're never coming down now.
