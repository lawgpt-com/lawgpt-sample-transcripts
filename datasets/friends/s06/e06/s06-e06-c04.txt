Rachel Green: Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Monica Geller: Oh God!
Rachel Green: You remember when we got these?
Monica Geller: No.
Rachel Green: I guess you weren't there.
Phoebe Buffay: You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Rachel Green: I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Monica Geller: I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Monica Geller: I don't think there's anything.
Phoebe Buffay: Come on, there's gotta be something.
Monica Geller: Nope, she's perfect.
Rachel Green: I have one.
Phoebe Buffay: Good! Great! You can go first.
Rachel Green: Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Phoebe Buffay: Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Monica Geller: Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Monica Geller: Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Rachel Green: You get your messages!
Monica Geller: Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Rachel Green: So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Phoebe Buffay: Great! It worked! No one's sad.
