Chandler Bing: Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Ross Geller: Joey's not going.
Joey Tribbiani: I didn't finish my five pages.
Chandler Bing: Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Ross Geller: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Joey Tribbiani: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Chandler Bing: Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Ross Geller: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Chandler Bing: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Ross Geller: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey Tribbiani: Come on look guys, don't fight.
Ross Geller: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Chandler Bing: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Ross Geller: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Ross Geller: How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Chandler Bing: I paid for those tickets!
Ross Geller: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah!
