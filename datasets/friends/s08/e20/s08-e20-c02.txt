Ross Geller: Well do you want some help?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Ross Geller: Awesome!
Chandler Bing: Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Joey Tribbiani: All right! Let's play Bamboozled!
Chandler Bing: Bamboozled?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Chandler Bing: No!
Joey Tribbiani: All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Ross Geller: Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh...
Joey Tribbiani: I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Chandler Bing: Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
Joey Tribbiani: Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Chandler Bing: Bogota.
Joey Tribbiani: It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
Chandler Bing: What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Joey Tribbiani: I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Chandler Bing: Higher or lower than what?
Joey Tribbiani: This is embarrassing.
Chandler Bing: Can you believe how lame this is?
Ross Geller: I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
