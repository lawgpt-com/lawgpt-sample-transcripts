Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Ross Geller: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Phoebe Buffay: That's a good idea for a business!
Chandler Bing: I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Joey Tribbiani: That-that is a good trick.
Chandler Bing: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Ross Geller: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Joey Tribbiani: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Ross Geller: They're not a couple!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Ross Geller: Oh yeah!
Joey Tribbiani: Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Chandler Bing: Really?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Ross Geller: No.
Joey Tribbiani: Noooo!!
