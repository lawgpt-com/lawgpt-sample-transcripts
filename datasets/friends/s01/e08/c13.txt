Chandler Bing: Hey, Lowell.
Lowell: Hey, Chandler.
Chandler Bing: So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Lowell: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Chandler Bing: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Lowell: I know. That's what I told her.
Chandler Bing: Really.
Lowell: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: So- you can tell?
Lowell: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Chandler Bing: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Lowell: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
Chandler Bing: He is?
Lowell: Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Chandler Bing: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
