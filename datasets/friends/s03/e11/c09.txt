Ross Geller: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Chandler Bing: Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Ross Geller: All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Chandler Bing: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Ross Geller: Where in Cuba?
