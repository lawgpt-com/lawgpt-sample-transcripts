Monica Geller: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Phoebe Buffay: I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Monica Geller: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica Geller: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Monica Geller: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Monica Geller: I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe Buffay: I know.
