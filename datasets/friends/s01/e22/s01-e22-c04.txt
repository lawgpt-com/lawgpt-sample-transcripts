Monica Geller: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Rachel Green: Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Monica Geller: What?
Rachel Green: Could tonight be the Night?
Monica Geller: I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Rachel Green: So, did you shave your legs?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: A-ha!
