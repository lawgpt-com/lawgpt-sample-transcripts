Chandler Bing: My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Rachel Green: You will like it!
Joey Tribbiani: No I won't.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: You don't even know!
Joey Tribbiani: Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: Well look, if you don't like this...
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know why you say that so soon.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Joey Tribbiani: Francette? What is she? A couch?
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Rachel Green: Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Rachel Green: That's weird.
Joey Tribbiani: No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Rachel Green: It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Rachel Green: Joey, I really don't...
Joey Tribbiani: Can you tell me how this happened?
Rachel Green: Well no.
Joey Tribbiani: Miracle!
Rachel Green: No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Joey Tribbiani: Someone like an...angel?
Rachel Green: That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Joey Tribbiani: Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
