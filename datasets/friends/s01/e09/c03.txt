Ross Geller: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Susan Bunch: No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Ross Geller: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Ross Geller: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Susan Bunch: What's it look like?
Ross Geller: Kinda like a big face without skin.
Susan Bunch: Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ross Geller: Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Susan Bunch: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Ross Geller: Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Susan Bunch: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Ross Geller: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Susan Bunch: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Ross Geller: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Susan Bunch: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Ross Geller: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Susan Bunch: Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Ross Geller: Really?
Susan Bunch: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
