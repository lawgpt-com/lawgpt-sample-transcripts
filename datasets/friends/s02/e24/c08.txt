Rachel Green: Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Ross Geller: I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Rachel Green: Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Ross Geller: Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Rachel Green: Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
