Phoebe Buffay: Thank you so much for this.
Rachel Green: Oh, d'you like it?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
Rachel Green: What?
Phoebe Buffay: You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
Rachel Green: Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
Rachel Green: Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Rachel Green: Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
