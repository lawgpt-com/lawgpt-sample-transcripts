Shelley: Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Chandler Bing: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Shelley: Oh! Okay! Phew!
Chandler Bing: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Shelley: I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Chandler Bing: ...Quality, right, great.
Shelley: Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.

Chandler Bing: Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Shelley: Is Brian...?
Chandler Bing: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Shelley: Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Chandler Bing: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
