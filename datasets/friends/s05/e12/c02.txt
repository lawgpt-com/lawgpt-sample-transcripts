Joey Tribbiani: Hey Ross!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
#ALL#: What? Oh!
Chandler Bing: Sorry man.
Gunther: Here's your scone.
Ross Geller: Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Chandler Bing: Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Rachel Green: Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Phoebe Buffay: Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Joey Tribbiani: Anybody gonna eat that?
