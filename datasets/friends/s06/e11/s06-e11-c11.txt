Phoebe Buffay: Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Rachel Green: Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Phoebe Buffay: No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Rachel Green: Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Phoebe Buffay: That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Rachel Green: No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Rachel Green: Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Phoebe Buffay: No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Rachel Green: Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Phoebe Buffay: I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Rachel Green: What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Phoebe Buffay: But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Rachel Green: Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Rachel Green: That's right!
