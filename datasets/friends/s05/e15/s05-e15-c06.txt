Monica Geller: Isn't this great?
Chandler Bing: Hmm.
Monica Geller: Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Monica Geller: Are you okay?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Monica Geller: What-what are you doing?
Chandler Bing: I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Monica Geller: Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Chandler Bing: What?!
Monica Geller: Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Chandler Bing: Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Monica Geller: Oh and you know what I want!
Chandler Bing: Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Monica Geller: I do not have baby fever!
Chandler Bing: Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Monica Geller: Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Chandler Bing: Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Monica Geller: You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Chandler Bing: Well, I did not know that.
