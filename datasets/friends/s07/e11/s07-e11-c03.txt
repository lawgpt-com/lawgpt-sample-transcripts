Phoebe Buffay: Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Rachel Green: Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Rachel Green: "Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Ross Geller: Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Phoebe Buffay: So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Ross Geller: Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
Phoebe Buffay: I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Joey Tribbiani: Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, it does.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, you wore me down.
Ross Geller: Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Joey Tribbiani: The Ross-Is that back?!!
