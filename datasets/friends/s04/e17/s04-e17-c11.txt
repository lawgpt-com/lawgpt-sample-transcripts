Rachel Green: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Monica Geller: That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Rachel Green: Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Phoebe Buffay: I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Rachel Green: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Chandler Bing: A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe Buffay: No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Rachel Green: Relaxi-Taxi!

Monica Geller: Hello.
Ross Geller: Hey.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?

Ross Geller: No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Monica Geller: All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Ross Geller: About four hours.
Monica Geller: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Rachel Green: Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, that is better.
