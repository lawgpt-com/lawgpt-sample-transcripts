unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Where you going, Joe?
Joey Tribbiani: For a walk.
Chandler Bing: Oh. You mind if I join you?
Joey Tribbiani: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Chandler Bing: Your thoughts? Plural?
Joey Tribbiani: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Chandler Bing: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Joey Tribbiani: Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Chandler Bing: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Joey Tribbiani: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Chandler Bing: Great novels?
Joey Tribbiani: Fine ... mediocre porn.
