Phoebe Buffay: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
Rachel Green: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
Phoebe Buffay: I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Rachel Green: Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Rachel Green: Uh, let's rip!
Phoebe Buffay: Really? Are you sure?
Rachel Green: Oh Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, sorry. Yeah.
Tag Jones: Hey Rach.
