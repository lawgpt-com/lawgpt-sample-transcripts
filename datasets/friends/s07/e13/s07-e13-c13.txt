Phoebe Buffay: Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Guy: Hey guy!
Phoebe Buffay: Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Earl: No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Phoebe Buffay: All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Earl: Yeah! Right!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Earl: Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay: No, whatever! Anything!
The "Hey Guy" Guy: Hey guy!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, he's gotta go.
Earl: Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Phoebe Buffay: No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
Supervisor: The new girl's good.
