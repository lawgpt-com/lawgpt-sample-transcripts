Hitchhiker: Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay.
Hitchhiker: This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.

Hitchhiker: All right, see ya Pheebs.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Phoebe Buffay: Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Joey Tribbiani: Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Phoebe Buffay: You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.

Joey Tribbiani: That is incredible! You are the master!
