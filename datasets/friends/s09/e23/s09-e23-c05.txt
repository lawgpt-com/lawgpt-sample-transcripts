Monica Geller: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler Bing: I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Monica Geller: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Chandler Bing: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica Geller: What? Why?
Chandler Bing: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Monica Geller: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Chandler Bing: I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Monica Geller: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Chandler Bing: Man, that's some bad advice!
