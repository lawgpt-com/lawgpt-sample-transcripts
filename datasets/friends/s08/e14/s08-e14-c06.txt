Joey Tribbiani: Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
Chandler Bing: And here we go...
Joey Tribbiani: I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.
