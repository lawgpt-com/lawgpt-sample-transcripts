Chandler Bing: Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: What's up buddy?
Chandler Bing: What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani: Waiting for candy.
Chandler Bing: Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Monica Geller: Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
#ALL#: We want candy! We want candy now!
Chandler Bing: All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
The Man: Candy Lady?
Chandler Bing: No not Candy Lady.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Chandler Bing: All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Joey Tribbiani: That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Monica Geller: Thank you.
Chandler Bing: You're welcome.
Monica Geller: Did you smoke?
Chandler Bing: No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Monica Geller: I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
