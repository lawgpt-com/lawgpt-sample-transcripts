Chandler Bing: I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Joey Tribbiani: Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
Chandler Bing: Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
Hooker: Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking...
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
Chandler Bing: That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
Joey Tribbiani: I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Hooker: Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Chandler Bing: Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
