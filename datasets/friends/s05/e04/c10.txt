Ross Geller: Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Monica Geller: A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, it's not a toy.
Ross Geller: Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Monica Geller: All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
