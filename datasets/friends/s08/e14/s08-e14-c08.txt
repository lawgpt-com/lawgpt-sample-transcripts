Chandler Bing: There has got to be a way!
Joey Tribbiani: Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Chandler Bing: Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
Joey Tribbiani: Then why do you throw like one?
Chandler Bing: Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Joey Tribbiani: Sure. "Monica."
Chandler Bing: So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Chandler Bing: That's a good idea.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I just...I feel terrible.
Chandler Bing: Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
