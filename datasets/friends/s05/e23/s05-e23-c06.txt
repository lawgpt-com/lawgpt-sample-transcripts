Phoebe Buffay: Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Monica Geller: Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Phoebe Buffay: For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Chandler Bing: Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Joey Tribbiani: Hi!
Chandler Bing: Love your condoms my man.
Joey Tribbiani: What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Phoebe Buffay: Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Monica Geller: Who are you talking too?
Joey Tribbiani: They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Chandler Bing: Why?! What happened?!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Monica Geller: I'm so sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Chandler Bing: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Monica Geller: I knew you were not okay with that.
Phoebe Buffay: So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, what-what's going on?
Phoebe Buffay: Monica had lunch with Richard.
Joey Tribbiani: Dawson?!
Phoebe Buffay: Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Chandler Bing: No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Monica Geller: It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Chandler Bing: When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Monica Geller: You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Chandler Bing: Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani: Aww, there we go.
Phoebe Buffay: I love Vegas!
Monica Geller: I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Chandler Bing: Next time?
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, so close.
Chandler Bing: There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Monica Geller: I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Chandler Bing: That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Monica Geller: Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Chandler Bing: Fine with me!
Monica Geller: Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Monica Geller: No it is not!
Chandler Bing: What are you talking...
Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
