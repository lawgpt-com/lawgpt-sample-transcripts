Monica Geller: Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Chandler Bing: Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
unknown: nan
Monica Geller: I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Chandler Bing: Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
unknown: nan
Monica Geller: Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Monica Geller: Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Chandler Bing: Why haven't you told them?!
Monica Geller: Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Chandler Bing: Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Monica Geller: So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Chandler Bing: Why wouldn't they be happy?
Monica Geller: Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing: What? What? Why?!
Monica Geller: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Chandler Bing: Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Monica Geller: Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing: Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Monica Geller: You really think that'll work?
Chandler Bing: Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Monica Geller: I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
