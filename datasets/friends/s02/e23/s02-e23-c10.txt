Joey Tribbiani: Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Chandler Bing: Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Joey Tribbiani: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Chandler Bing: Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Joey Tribbiani: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Chandler Bing: Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Joey Tribbiani: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Chandler Bing: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Chandler Bing: Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Joey Tribbiani: Karen.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Joey Tribbiani: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Chandler Bing: Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Joey Tribbiani: Really?
Chandler Bing: No freakshow, she's fictional.
Joey Tribbiani: Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Chandler Bing: Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani: It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
