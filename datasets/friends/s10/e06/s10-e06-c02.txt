Chandler Bing: Hey honey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hi sweetie!
Chandler Bing: Is Monica not here?
Joey Tribbiani: No.
Chandler Bing: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Joey Tribbiani: Cool!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Joey Tribbiani: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Chandler Bing: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
Joey Tribbiani: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
Chandler Bing: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Joey Tribbiani: I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Chandler Bing: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm cold!
