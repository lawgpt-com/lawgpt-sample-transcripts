Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you're back!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: How was your conference?
Chandler Bing: It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Chandler Bing: Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Monica Geller: Hi!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you're back too!
Monica Geller: Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, how was your chef thing?
Monica Geller: Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Chandler Bing: Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Monica Geller: Chandler!
Chandler Bing: Monica.

Monica Geller: Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Chandler Bing: Okay, fine, $300.
Monica Geller: 300 dollars?!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Monica Geller: Urghh!!
Joey Tribbiani: What are you guys woofing about?
Monica Geller: Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Joey Tribbiani: Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
