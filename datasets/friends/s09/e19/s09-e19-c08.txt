Ross Geller: Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?
Chandler Bing: USA Today.
Ross Geller: Nice, put it with the others.
Chandler Bing: And I also got... two more apples.
Ross Geller: We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
Chandler Bing: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ross Geller: Oh, that's not cool.
Chandlers: Dude, none of this is cool.
Ross Geller: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
Chandler Bing: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Ross Geller: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Chandler Bing: Ok, how about this ?
Ross Geller: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Chandler Bing: Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Ross Geller: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Chandler Bing: No!
Ross Geller: At least tell me where you hid it.
