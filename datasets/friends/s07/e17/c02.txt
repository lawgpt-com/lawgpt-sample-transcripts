Ross Geller: Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Chandler Bing: Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
The Woman: Could you guys help me?
Ross Geller: Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
The Woman: It-it's really heavy.
Ross Geller: I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
The Woman: I-I am Kristen.
Ross Geller: Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Kristen Leigh: I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ross Geller: Ah.
Kristen Leigh: But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Ross Geller: Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Chandler Bing: Smooth.
Kristen Leigh: Excuse me?
Ross Geller: Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Kristen Leigh: Oh I'd like that.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Kristen Leigh: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Kristen Leigh: After you.
Ross Geller: Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
