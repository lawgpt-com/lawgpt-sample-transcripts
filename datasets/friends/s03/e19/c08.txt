Kate Miller: Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
The Director: Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Kate Miller: I have a question about this scene.
The Director: Yes?
Kate Miller: Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
The Director: Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Kate Miller: I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Kate Miller: It doesn't say that in the script.
Joey Tribbiani: It does in mine!
