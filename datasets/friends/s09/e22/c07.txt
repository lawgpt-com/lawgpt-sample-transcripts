Joey Tribbiani: Hello?
Ross Geller: Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Joey Tribbiani: No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Ross Geller: I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! How's it going?
Ross Geller: It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Joey Tribbiani: What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Ross Geller: Barbados.
Joey Tribbiani: Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Ross Geller: What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, just wake him up!
Ross Geller: I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Joey Tribbiani: Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
