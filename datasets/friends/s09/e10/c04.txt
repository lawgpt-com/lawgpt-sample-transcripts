Rachel Green: Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Chandler Bing: I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Rachel Green: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler Bing: What? That's terrible!
Phoebe Buffay: No-no, we do it every year!
Chandler Bing: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe Buffay: No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Rachel Green: Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Chandler Bing: No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, we have to!
Chandler Bing: No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Phoebe Buffay: Well then, you should look with us.
Chandler Bing: Why?
Rachel Green: Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Chandler Bing: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah.
Rachel Green: Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler Bing: If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Rachel Green: That's right!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Rachel Green: Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Rachel Green: Oh.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, who's it for?
Rachel Green: "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
