Tag Jones: So, what's this about?
Phoebe Buffay: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
Tag Jones: No. This is my red sweater.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Tag Jones: What's going on Rach?
Rachel Green: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Tag Jones: Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
Rachel Green: Oh, it's just not the right time.
Tag Jones: It is the right time.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Tag Jones: I'm ready for more.
Rachel Green: Tag...
Tag Jones: Come on Rach, let's give it another try.
Rachel Green: I'm having a baby.
Tag Jones: Oh.

Rachel Green: You can go.
Tag Jones: Thank you.
