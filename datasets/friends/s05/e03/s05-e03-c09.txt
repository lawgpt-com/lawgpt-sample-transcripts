Rachel Green: Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Phoebe Buffay: Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Rachel Green: Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Rachel Green: Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, just ask him!
Rachel Green: Me?!
Phoebe Buffay: I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Rachel Green: No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
