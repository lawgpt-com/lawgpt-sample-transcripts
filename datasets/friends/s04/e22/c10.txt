Phoebe Buffay: Hi, guys.
Rachel Green: Hi! Phoebe.
Monica Geller: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Rachel Green: No we...
Monica Geller: Hormones.
Rachel Green: ...hormones, yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Monica Geller: Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Phoebe Buffay: Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Rachel Green: Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh!
Rachel Green: It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Rachel Green: Well, h-how is this like that?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Rachel Green: I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Phoebe Buffay: Alrighty, here come the water works.
