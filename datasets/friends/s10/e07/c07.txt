Mike Hannigan: We're seriously asking for our money back?
Phoebe Buffay: It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Charity Guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
Phoebe Buffay: Gay, go.
Mike Hannigan: Oh my God, I love your shirt!
Phoebe Buffay: The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
Charity Guy: Excuse me?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.
Charity Guy: So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Mike Hannigan: Yeah! This feels really good.
Phoebe Buffay: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Charity Guy: Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing...
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to "kill me" or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.
Mike Hannigan: She could have been talking about either one of us.
