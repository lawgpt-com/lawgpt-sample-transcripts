Phoebe Buffay: Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Rachel Green: Well, I'd have to say gay.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah? Why?
Rachel Green: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Rachel Green: All right, straight, and not subtle.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Rachel Green: Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Phoebe Buffay: Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Rachel Green: What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Rachel Green: What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Phoebe Buffay: That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Rachel Green: Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Phoebe Buffay: No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Rachel Green: Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Phoebe Buffay: Nice try.
Rachel Green: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know.
