Phoebe Buffay: Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
Nurse: I think I know who you're talking about.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Nurse: I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff...
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Nurse: Dr. Drake who?
Joey Tribbiani: Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
Nurse: A doctor at this hospital?
Joey Tribbiani: Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
Phoebe Buffay: Hands.
Joey Tribbiani: Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
Nurse: He's in room 816.
Joey Tribbiani: 816, thank you!
Phoebe Buffay: Thank you.
