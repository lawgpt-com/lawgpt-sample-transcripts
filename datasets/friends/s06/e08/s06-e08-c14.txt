Phoebe Buffay: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Rachel Green: You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Phoebe Buffay: Just for a second.
Rachel Green: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Rachel Green: I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Rachel Green: That wouldn't help me.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, yes it would.
