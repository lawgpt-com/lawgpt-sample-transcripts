Chandler Bing: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Monica Geller: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Joey Tribbiani: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Chandler Bing: And so incorrect!
Monica Geller: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Ross Geller: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Chandler Bing: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Monica Geller: And a lot could still get in our way.
Chandler Bing: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
Phoebe Buffay: What are you gonna name the baby?
Chandler Bing: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Joey Tribbiani: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Monica Geller: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Chandler Bing: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Monica Geller: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Chandler Bing: Yes, but...
Monica Geller: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
Chandler Bing: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
