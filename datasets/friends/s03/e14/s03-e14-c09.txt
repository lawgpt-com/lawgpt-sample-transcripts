Monica Geller: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe Buffay: It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Monica Geller: Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Phoebe Buffay: You think you know me so well.
Monica Geller: Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Okay, well I do know you.
Phoebe Buffay: That's what I said.
Monica Geller: Well so?
Phoebe Buffay: I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
