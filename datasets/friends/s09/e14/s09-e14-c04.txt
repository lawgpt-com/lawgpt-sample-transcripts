Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
Joey Tribbiani: All right! Who is he?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Phoebe Buffay: A teacher?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my god, you're right!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: She even reads for pleasure!
Phoebe Buffay: How do you even know a woman like that?
Joey Tribbiani: What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Phoebe Buffay: Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Phoebe Buffay: So now what do we do?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
Phoebe Buffay: What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah, yes, The Plan!
Phoebe Buffay: It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
Phoebe Buffay: No, I think we killed it.
