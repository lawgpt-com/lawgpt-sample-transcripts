Rachel Green: What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
Joey Tribbiani: I just have one question!
Rachel Green: Shoot!
Joey Tribbiani: What the hell are you doin'???
Rachel Green: I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
Rachel Green: Who...?
Joey Tribbiani: CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!

Rachel Green: But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Joey Tribbiani: I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
