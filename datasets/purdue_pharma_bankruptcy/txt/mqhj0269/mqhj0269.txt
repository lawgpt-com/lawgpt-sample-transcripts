THE COURT:

Okay, good morning.

agenda for today's hearing, and I'm happy to go down the

5

calendar, in the order of the agenda.

6
7

We're here in In re:

This is Judge

MR. HUEBNER:

Purdue Pharma, LP.

Terrific.

I have the

Good morning, Your Honor.

Can you hear me clearly?

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. HUEBNER:

Yes, and see you.
Well, probably better just to hear

10

me.

So, the first item on the agenda -- there are three

11

items on for the agenda today.

12

claims related matter that my colleague Ms. Jacquelyn

13

Knudson will be handling, so if I may turn over the virtual

14

podium to her.

15

THE COURT:

16

MS. KNUDSON:

17

The first is an uncontested

Okay, that's fine.
Morning, Your Honor.

For the record

--

18

THE COURT:

19

MS. KNUDSON:

Morning.
-- Jacquelyn Knudson of Davis, Polk,

20

and Wardwell on behalf of the Debtors.

21

clearly?

22

THE COURT:

23

MS. KNUDSON:

Yes.

Can you hear me

Fine, thank.

Excellent.

As set forth in Mr.

24

Cobb's motion, he's been incarcerated for the past 17 years.

25

He notes that he has no access to a computer and the

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 11
1

internet and is not allowed to make toll-free calls.

2

also cited COVID-19 lockdowns of the prison as an additional

3

reason for his untimely claim.

4

we believe there's a colorable basis for granting Mr. Cobb's

5

requested extension.

6

He

Based on these assertions,

Moreover, given the limited number of late claim

7

motions filed to date, and the fact that the proposed order

8

preserves the trust's ability to review the merits of Mr.

9

Cobb's claim, and also, in an effort to avoid the undue cost

10

of litigating this motion, we believe the proposed order is

11

a reasonable resolution.

12

As we've done in the past, we also consulted with

13

both the Creditors Committee and the Ad Hoc Group of

14

Individual Victims, and they have both consented to the

15

relief requested.

16

Honor may have.

17

Debtors (sound drops) at Docket No. 3011 be entered.

18

I'm happy to answer any questions Your
Otherwise, in light of the foregoing, the

THE COURT:

Right.

I don't have any questions.

19

The Debtors' decision, which is unopposed, to grant the late

20

claim motion, is warranted here under Rule 9006, and

21

Pioneer, it's clear to me that Mr. Cobb's failure to file a

22

timely proof of claim is based on excusable neglect.

23

really isn't, one would say, neglect, so much as the fact

24

that he's, as you said, incarcerated, has very limited

25

access to the means to file a claim, and he diligently tried

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

It

516-608-2400

Page 12
1

to do so.

So, under all those circumstances, I'll grant the

2

I'll enter the order granting the motion, which, as I note,

3

and as you've noted, makes it clear that this shouldn't be

4

read as any sort of overall authority to file a late claim.

5

MS. KNUDSON:

6

THE COURT:

7

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

Thank you.

So, you can email that order to

chambers.

8

MS. KNUDSON:

9

THE COURT:

10

MR. HUEBNER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

We will.

Okay.
And Your Honor, as I think the Court

11

knows, this is the approach we've really taken with

12

everybody, you know, even where it requires a bunch of work

13

from the Debtors, the UCC, and other parties.

14

trying very hard (sound drops) and circumstances where we

15

think it's appropriate (sound drops) you know, not (sound

16

drops) circumstances, including incarceration, but I think

17

that we have worked very hard (sound drops), and I'm glad

18

that no parties are objecting to resolutions like this, the

19

relief (sound drops).

20

We're really

The second item on the agenda, Your Honor, I, at

21

least, intend to be extraordinarily brief.

22

Court, obviously, will know, the disclosure statement is out

23

as we speak for a vote or in the process of getting out with

24

thumb drives and documents being printed, our confirmation

25

hearing is now out, weeks away.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

You know, as the

516-608-2400

Page 13
1

We actually feel quite strongly, along with,

2

obviously, many other parties, that we need (sound drops) to

3

get us to confirmation, but obviously, having, you know,

4

merely a few weeks before confirmation, while we very much

5

hope that a subset, and ideally, in a fantasy world, all of

6

the Nonconsenting States come into the deal, we cannot agree

7

with their petition that if their mediation fails, the

8

injunction ends and, essentially, you know, everything we've

9

been working for is put onto a radically different track,

10

especially days before the confirmation hearing from

11

(indiscernible) to get to confirmation clearly is the right

12

answer.

13

We note that the (indiscernible) the injunction

14

requested is supported by virtually every party in the case,

15

implicitly or explicitly, and opposed only by the NCSG.

16

They have, graciously, been brief in their pleadings.

17

were graciously brief in our reply.

18

continuing to construct a voluntary compliance as opposed

19

to, obviously, a mandatory injunction, and with that I would

20

propose to rest on the papers.

21

THE COURT:

Okay.

We

We have no problem with

All right.

And I believe there

22

was only, as you say, the one objection to the motion,

23

which, as I read it, was a limited objection as to the

24

duration of the extension of the preliminary injunction, and

25

that was by the Nonconsenting States Group.

212-267-6868

Mr. Troop, do

516-608-2400

you have anything further to say in support of the

2

objection?

4

MR. TROOP:

Thank you, Your Honor.

me clearly?

5

THE COURT:

Yes, and see you.

6

MR. TROOP:

Thank you.

Your Honor, I really don't

7

have anything terribly substantive to say in addition to

8

what's in our pleadings.

9

to keep people on short leashes in connection with the

The practice in this case has been

10

mediations that are ongoing, and deadlines coming back to

11

you pending (sound drops).

12

So, it seemed to me, simply from a (sound drops)

13

the NCSG, simply from a perspective of good case management,

14

that not waiting until confirmation to be back before you,

15

might result in something that changes your mind with regard

16

to the preliminary injunction, or might not, and that, given

17

the way that the hearings on the preliminary injunction have

18

condensed themselves over time, it did not seem a terrible

19

imposition to doing the process.

20
21

So, Your Honor, with that, I otherwise rest on our
papers.

Thank you.
THE COURT:

Huebner.

right, or is the hearing the 28th?

11

MR. TROOP:

The hearing starts on the 9th and I

13

THE COURT:

An extra day is reserved.

14

MR. TROOP:

Extra day reserved.

15

MR. HUEBNER:

16

THE COURT:

12

believe --

Yeah.
All right.

Well, I -- obviously, no

17

one has objected to extension of the injunction, at least

18

through the date of the ongoing mediation.

19

whether I should extend it further through the confirmation

20

hearing, which would be the reserved dates for that hearing.

21

Frankly, I think the unusual circumstance that would argue

22

for not doing that, would be a turn of events at the

23

confirmation hearing that would suggest that a plan that

24

contemplated a settlement that would include a substantial

25

payment by the Sackler families would not be confirmed, and

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

The issue is

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

that no similar plan would be confirmed.

2

That is, of course, certainly possible.

However,

3

it seems to me, given the need to have some control over

4

where the case would go after that, I think having it

5

through the scheduled dates is warranted, even if I

6

concluded, for example, earlier than that, because the

7

confirmation hearing wouldn't run through the 30th, that I

8

wouldn't confirm the plan.

9

I still think there's probably a worthwhile basis

10

to have an injunctive pause for a few days, up to August

11

30th, for everyone to get their bearings, and I think the

12

parties' focus, in addition, obviously, to being on the

13

mediation, should be on preparing for the confirmation

14

hearing, rather than adding the potential litigation over

15

the preliminary injunction to that hearing, so I will grant

16

the motion through the last date scheduled for that hearing,

17

for the reasons that I've previously granted extensions and,

18

as affirmed by then Chief Judge McMahon, I believe that the

19

injunction is warranted.

20

The issue raised was the timing issue, which I've

21

just separately addressed.

22

harms over the timing issue, it seems to me that a focus on

23

the mediation and confirmation litigation is the key focus

24

at this time, rather than an additional focus that might

25

take place after the mediation, if the mediation is not

212-267-6868

In terms of the balancing of the

wholly successful on litigation over the preliminary

injunction.

3

So, I will grant the requested extension, again,

4

with the language that has been agreed pertaining to the

5

Nonconsenting States, as reiterated in their limited

6

objection to this extension motion.

understand how and why this happened, who was responsible,

24

and how it could be prevented in the future.

Since that time, the Jacksons have struggled to

Today, they find themselves, like thousands of

Page 18
1

creditors in this case, confronting a process -- this

2

Chapter 11 case -- that is, to them, opaque and byzantine.

3

Like many creditors in these cases, the Jacksons worry that

4

the owners of the Debtors, the Sackler families, may have

5

manipulated this process to obtain releases that will, once

6

granted, almost certainly make it impossible to learn any

7

more about the secretive family that has controlled the

8

Debtors.

9

As explained in our motion and reply, there is

10

reason for concern.

11

concedes that the board of directors that made this decision

12

shortly before bankruptcy was not independent of them, and

13

there's evidence from the Debtors' own --

THE COURT:

The Debtors' objection practically

Lipson?

a binding decision and, in essence, controlled bankruptcy

MR. LIPSON:

I contend that it had a significant

statements, involving things like the historic control that

THE COURT:

Okay.

That's probably a good idea,

because what I was going to go through is the various points

where you seek different relief, not only in the initial

motion, but in the reply, so you tell me now, what is the

relief you're seeking?

MR. LIPSON:

We simply want to know whether the

process by which the board of directors of Purdue Pharma,

during this case, and shortly before this case, to release

the Sacklers, was free of influence by the Sacklers.

You want to know whether the

17

That's what you want to investigate, whether the people on

the board who made the decision, as embodied in the plan

That's what you're looking for.

twists and turns, and we know there have been many -- in

And in fact, it is coming out, if

actually says.

makes the very odd conclusion, which, I don't know whether

is that during the Delphi case -- a case which, at that

moment, was requiring people to work around the clock, day

after day, because of the impending collapse of GM and the

conferences and at hearings, and he, in this book referenced

THE COURT:

Because that's apparently when the

And as far as I can tell, you

define that about as broadly as one can, which is either, A,

determination not to settle with the Sacklers.

That's your definition of the deal?

MR. LIPSON:

No.
Because there was no deal until about

half an hour before the final day before the disclosure

this is not what you have the examiner now, as you stated,

No, it's not

That's what we want and the thing to study, the

8

thing to study is simply the question, did the Sackler

9

families use their governance powers to unduly influence

10

both the board, shortly before the bankruptcy, once the

11

Sacklers decided to give the company up -- not a final deal,

12

but they made the decision -- and then during the case when

13

the Special Committee was appointed.

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. LIPSON:

Okay.
Your Honor, confirmation is coming

16

soon.

We understand that and we very, very narrowly

17

tailored the timing of the examiner not to interfere with

18

that.

19

Jackson has that the 3,500 people who signed a petition on

20

Change.org asking for an examiner in this case

(indiscernible) they have -- they're not going to vanish.

22

They're not going to go away.

answer, I believe, is absolutely yes, Your Honor.

that Congress said that Senator DeConcini said that the

reason we have examiners is to assure the public of the

integrity of the reorganization process in cases -- large

cases of great public interest.

21

We know

So, cases like Enron, cases like New Century,

cases like Washington Mutual, cases like WorldCom have all

involved allegations of serious wrongdoing and have all

involved examiners who, in those cases, were doing much more

than we're asking for here.

We're looking for some assurance

Okay.

Exactly.

As far as the debt threshold of

1104(c)(2), what evidence are you relying on?

18

MR. LIPSON:

Well, let's start with the Debtors'

19

own disclosure statement.

20

not my words -- their words, that the Department of Justice

21

has "an allowed unsubordinated, undisputed, noncontingent,

22

liquidated, unsecured claim against Purdue Pharma in the

23

amount of $2.8 billion, arising from the Department of

24

Justice's civil investigation."

25

Right?

At Page 131, they say --

Now, we know that the Creditors Committee and I

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 44
1

believe the Debtors, it was still contingent, Your Honor,

2

because they don't have to collect.

3

something else.

4

proves too much.

5

that they can forbear from collection, the fact that they

6

can forebear from enforcement, doesn't make a claim

7

contingent.

8
9

They can rescind and do

Well, of course, Your Honor, but that
Creditors can always forbear.

THE COURT:

The fact

Well, this wouldn't be forbearance.

This is a right to rescind.

10

MR. LIPSON:

The right to rescind, Your Honor,

11

then says they have a choice.

12

everybody or their claims balloon back up to their full

13

amount.

14
15

They can either pursue

The full amount is not contingent or unliquidated.
THE COURT:

I'm sorry, the full amount of their

claim?

16

MR. LIPSON:

The full -- I believe, their claim

17

has two components, one of which is clearly stated, two

18

claims at $2.8 million each, one of which is trebled.

19

is a portion that is contingent, but that's irrelevant.

20

$2.8 million is clearly more than $5 million.

21

THE COURT:

There

No, but it -- the order actually says,

Paragraph 6, "The United States shall have an allowed

11

-- of the proof of claim, not the allowed claim, but the

12

proof of claim.

13
14

MR. LIPSON:

Correct.

I believe you just answered

your question.

15

THE COURT:

Right?

So, and I think your reply

16

that came in last night actually contemplates, not only not

17

confirmation of the plan, but also the appointment of a

18

Trustee and/or liquidation of the Debtors, right, so that's

19

a contingency, isn't it?

those possibilities.

THE COURT:

No.

I am, for example, referring to a

statement on Page 23 of your motion where you state -- you

5

clearly imply, quoting me from an opinion, a bench ruling I

6

gave, in September 2020, where I, as part of the factual

analysis, said, "It appears to me to have always been the

case."

13

Metromedia,

Now, what you neglect to say, and I can understand

framework, subject to massive due diligence and further

negotiation -- which, in fact, I think, has undisputedly

23

occurred since then -- is the starting point for a review

24

of, as you say, "the process."

Your Honor, it is difficult to know where to begin

out, the fundamental attacks on every party to this case

and, in fact, themselves calling to question the integrity,

8

not only of a great many people, but frankly, of the

It actually is quite important, because Professor

I'm going to apologize in advance.

I will try

11

very hard, but I will -- I may end up slipping into a level

12

of passion and a tone that in the case of one of the most

13

difficult cases I've worked for two years, the Court has

14

never heard from me, but candidly, as I think you will hear,

15

I actually think that Professor Lipson's pleading, in many

16

respects, is outside the bounds of acceptable advocacy to a

17

Court of law.

18

Let me first begin with something on which I want

19

to be very clear.

21

denigrate, minimize, or (indiscernible) the unspeakable and

22

tragic (indiscernible) Mr. Jackson and his family, that

The Debtors' opposition to this motion

That said, the terrible and tragic circumstances
of the Jackson family cannot change the fact that the motion

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 56
1

contains no evidence whatsoever of the almost endless litany

2

of nasty, utterly unsupported, and flatly (indiscernible)

3

and unsupportable facts that Mr. Lipson blends into his

4

papers to justify the relief requested.

5

And remarkably, in his reply brief, filed very

6

late last night, he makes no attempt to fill the gaps.

7

fact, he doubles down.

8

why, why is Professor Lipson doing this at this stage in the

9

case and why Professor Lipson in particular.

10

In

I was asked, recently, by someone

So, I'm going to hazard a guess why relief --

11

because it's not supported by a single one of the hundreds

12

of thousands of creditors on the docket of this case, any of

13

the 12 organized groups, many of whom, I think it is fair to

14

say, hate, H-A-T-E, hate either or both of Purdue and the

15

Sacklers and describe them with words like criminal, kill,

16

evil, monster, in describing the opioid epidemic and joining

17

18

Lipson, in no small degree.

19

On November 10th, 2020, Professor Lipson gave the

20

Friel-Scanlon lecture at Temple University entitled -- I

21

guess, to generate interest -- "Sex, Drugs, and Bankruptcy:

22

Due Process and Social Debt," in which he argued, in

23

essence, the bankruptcy professional, and by extension, the

24

Courts, that work all day every day on these cases, are

25

basically corrupt, that they, in fact, do repeat deals with

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 57
1

one another, and that they sell out their own clients

2

because of the art of the deal.

3

He specifically actually says that in this case,

4

opioid victims were sold out because the professionals are

5

repeat players and the art of the deal is more important

6

than the epical, sacred obligation to address the dignity

7

and human values and rights of their clients.

8
9

In particular, he goes on to say that Akin Gump,
counsel to the UCC, and Milbank, counsel to Sacklers, are in

10

a huge number of deals together and that, in essence

11

(indiscernible) work stuff out as part of the art of the

12

deal in the relational bankruptcy world.

13

vicious view of what we do for a living might explain

14

Professor Lipson's otherwise mindboggling, unsupportable

15

claim that the UCC, Akin Gump, represented UCC, that in the

16

real world, on planet earth, has been battering and slamming

17

and attacking the Sacklers almost every day for two years

It also explains why, in the twisted maneuver that

2

is also outside the bounds of acceptable advocacy, Professor

3

Lipson, both in his opening brief and after his

extraordinary (indiscernible) statement were pointed out in

5

about a hundred pages of pleadings, totally, completely, and

6

utterly erases the Ad Hoc Committee, the MSGE, the PEC and

the MDL, and the mediators from his narrative, because, of

course, the country's mass tort lawyers and 48 attorneys

his relational view of what may have happened here.

11

And so, because they don't fit his "relational

theory" of Chapter 11, he closes his eyes again and again

13

and again to the actual facts of this case, which I'll

Letโs actually just for a minute close our eyes

The Debtorโs Special Committee, whose precursor

21

was formed in May 2019, conducted an investigation for over

22

22 months that involved an exhaustive review of allegations

23

against the Sacklers, the identification of legal claims,

24

reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents, the commission

25

of forensic analysis, and the publication of all transfers

to the Sacklers families, totaling over $11 billion, on the

2

docket for the whole world to see.

3

Despite all of this and the description of their

4

independence in the disclosure statement, Professor Lipsonโs

5

pleading goes on to great lengths to challenge it without

6

any evidence that, independent from the Sacklers, nothing

but essentially snide (indiscernible) arguendo.

Of course youโre not.

And then

10

there is a burden on the producing party to keep the

documents confidential.

12

Professor Lipson could have signed the protective

13

order, as so many other parties could have at any time and

14

basically seen everything.

15

litigate -- and weโll talk about that in a few minutes --

16

like every other party in the case, he is absolutely within

17

his rights to use every document, a hundred million pages,

18

probably the most in the history of the world, he is

19

entitled to use all those documents in litigation, to object

20

to confirmation, to object to the disclosure statement, to

say that the deal was somehow born in sin.

we thought that something shouldnโt be made public of the

12

Now letโs talk for a minute about his next

13

ridiculous disclosure that because independent directors

14

were not insulated from removal formally until November

15

19th, somehow they were captured or jaded or something until

16

then.

17

Let me be very clear.

Iโve been doing what I do

18

for a pretty long time and Iโve seen hundreds of situations

19

where companies needed an independent committee of the board

20

or a special committee of the board to investigate or

21

analyze a transaction or a potential litigation or a

22

potential merger where for a complex reason or other the

23

full board might not be disinterested, or it might just be

24

the better approach.

I donโt know what that means, but every one of

But hereโs the answer.

I have never in my entire

7

career seen any company do what we did, which is actually

8

formally block the shareholders from touching, removing, or

9

adding to the members of a special committee.

You can read

concerned with being so cleaner than the driven snow and

7

Now letโs talk about the UCC (indiscernible).

8

already read to the Court Professor Lipsonโs view

9

(indiscernible) for the Sacklers, just outrageous.

I

So I

10

want to remind Professor Lipson that the UCC is a statutory

11

fiduciary appointed by the Department of Justice of the

12

United States of America whose members include multiple

13

passionate victimsโ advocates who have suffered losses no

14

less unfathomable, egregious, and horrible (indiscernible).

15

That committee conducted its own massive, separate, and

16

entirely independent investigation for more than a year-and-

17

a-half, and it cost them tens of millions of dollars that

18

was appropriately spent but (indiscernible).

19

quite clear, as this Court lived every month for almost two

20

years, that the UCC was incredibly adversarial to the

21

Sacklers.

22

Sacklers and the like.

23

The record is

They pursued discovery from the debtors, from the

And by the way, on the relational theory, they

24

werenโt much more kind to the Sacklerโs lawyers.

25

actually sought to invade the privilege in an extraordinary

motion alleging the crime-fraud exception that the Sacklerโs

2

lawyers may have helped them commit crimes and that

3

therefore the Sacklerโs (indiscernible) attorney-client

4

privilege deserved to be invaded.

5

And, by the way, as an aside, to this day, I still

6

canโt pronounce Mr. Uzziโs name correctly, so I donโt know

7

if thereโs much coziness over there.

8
9

So whatโs the evidence -- whatโs the evidence that
Professor Lipson has of undue holiness -- unholiness and

10

birthed in sin?

No.

He ignores the fact that the Debtors

11

were involved in a discovery program that was unprecedented,

12

with 90 million pages of materials that he could have gotten

13

access to with one flick of a pen.

Because heโs pretty

21

much as strong on the law as he is on the facts.

22

Honor, Iโm going to skip the whole pot on what relief he

23

actually asks for because I think we finally got that

24

clarified.

25

he wants is radically different in different places,

212-267-6868

So, Your

Thereโs a whole lot of points where the relief

Page 79
1

including in Paragraph 17 of his reply, where he appears to

2

radically broaden the requested relief even over what was

3

originally sought in the extraordinary motion.

4

So now letโs just go to the law.

Letโs start with

5

1104(c)(1), the interests of creditors.

6

that you should appoint an examiner if itโs in the interest

7

of creditors.

8

in this case and there are 12 organized committees of

9

creditors and the fact that not a single other party on the

10

planet, including people who have been passionately adverse

11

to us nonstop for years have joined or supported the relief

12

I think pretty much tells you everything you need to know

13

about what everyone else in the entire case genuinely,

14

truly, and caringly believe is in the interest of creditors.

15

So 1104(c)(1) says

This claim looks nothing like that.

Because the

14

wasnโt actually that early -- when the contours of a plan

Is it actually mandatory?
So letโs explain.

I think the answer is no.

First of all, the legislative

one of these cases is from the 1980s and 1990s, which ended

14

a very long time ago.

15

the last twenty-something years is that court after court

has held that the as-is-appropriate language in 1104(c) in

fact gives the courts discretion to refuse to appoint an

that the appointment of an examiner would be inappropriate

led most effectively by the Creditorโs Committee.

Instead, Professor Lipson retreats to arguing that

the UCC investigation has not been sufficiently publicized

and in order to shoehorn into the argument that there is a

13

factual basis for an examination in this case, he argues

14

that we need to better understand the motivation or

influences that the Sacklers may have had over the special

committee and the board.

As Your Honor knows, and as the pleadings that

nearly every state in the country, plus hundreds of local

merely indicated that the parties who supported the

settlement term sheet would work to see whether they could

12

arrive at a settlement that would be the basis for a plan of

14

At the outset of the case, the settlement term

15

sheet was pursued in conjunction with an undertaking by the

16

Creditorโs Committee to pursue an extensive investigation

17

during this Chapter 11 case that had the active support of

18

the non-consenting states, the Ad Hoc Committee, and the

19

MSGE. And as Your Honor knows, there was no steps taken by

20

any parties in this case to commit to a settlement in this

case until that investigation was, if not completed, was

extensively explored.

Your Honor, there is no basis to suggest that the

alternative to settlement.

Your Honor, it is the case that the Ad Hoc

years and that ultimately at the end will in all likelihood

under the facts or the law for the appointment of an

I still am not completely clear makes a lot of sense.

regardless of the justification that heโs trying to

moment to talk about Peter Jackson, the moving party.

The first is the following.

I want to take a

Page 106
1

Jackson lost his daughter, Emily, almost exactly 15 years

2

ago to an overdose from taking one OxyContin prescribed for

3

her uncle.

4

opioid epidemic, Mr. Jacksonโs loss of an 18-year-old

5

daughter three days from the beginning of college should be

6

enough to make everyone stop for a moment and cherish the

7

time we have with our loved ones.

8

Putting aside the motion in this case and the

Point two, Mr. Jackson now dedicates his life to

9

being an advocate for the reform of prescription opioids.

10

In this way, he is like some of the individual members of

11

the UCC who also dedicate their lives to fighting the opioid

12

epidemic, whether it be through victim advocacy, counseling,

13

or helping the families of those who have lost loved ones.

14

Point three, given our personal views of Mr.

15

Jackson, itโs very difficult to take an emotional and

16

passionate and angry stance against him.

be on the same side as Purdue in this proceeding.

a testament to both the seriousness with which the UCC takes

19

its fiduciary duties and the unfortunate and in many ways

just plain wrong statements that Mr. Lipsonโs pleading make,

2

Point five, as you noted, Mr. Lipson was a bit all

3

over the place in his pleadings about what he wanted.

I

4

know he said earlier the scope of what he wanted as examiner

5

was to seek to examine the independence of the special

6

committee.

7

kind of believes that everything stems from the original

8

decision to enter into the settlement framework by the

9

special committee, which didnโt happen.

And if you think about it in biblical terms, he

And so itโs kind of

10

like everything thatโs happened in the case is the fruit of

11

the poisonous tree.

12

He also wants an examiner -- and I donโt want to

13

let this go because he says it five times in his reply -- he

14

says he wants the examiner to independently assure the

15

integrity of the reorganization process.

16

words five times in his reply.

17

UCCโs independence is not in question, in Paragraph 31.

18

itโs hard to understand a lot of what he says without

assuming heโs questioning everybodyโs independence in the

by virtue of the wording of the statute.

21

We

Messrs. Huebner, Eckstein, and Crawford have all

22

pointed out to you that many courts have determined that

wording of the statute does not make appointment of the

examiner mandatory in all circumstances, and that based on

25

the facts in this case, a court can determine not to appoint

Can I interrupt you?
And -- and -Can I -- let me -And to this day -I canโt let these to points -- no,

I cannot let these two points go by.

9

When you say inextricably intertwined, are you

10

actually alleging that that includes management or control

11

of the Debtors post-bankruptcy?

12

that?

13
14

MR. LIPSON:

No.

Are you actually alleging

THE COURT:

16

MR. LIPSON:

17

THE COURT:

Okay.
Thatโs the point.
Yeah, you donโt know what it means.

18

But youโre not alleging that because you have no evidence of

19

that.

Right?

20
21

MR. LIPSON:

We have the Debtorโs own admissions.

So all we have to do --

22

THE COURT:

No, no.

The debtor -- honestly.

You

23

believe that that admission applies to the post-bankruptcy

24

period as far as management or control of the debtors?

25

you read the papers?

Did

Did you see anything about interfering

with management?

That is a common ground for an injunction

2

to protect third parties, i.e. you canโt sue management or

3

the Board because they are active in running the company.

4

Did you see that in the pleadings?

5

MR. LIPSON:

6

THE COURT:

No, but thatโs not -No.

So do you think it might be a

7

logical inference that the inextricable nature that theyโre

8

referring to is with regard to the claims against both of

9

them and the source of recovery and the fact that there

10

would be inevitably the Debtors pulled into the litigation

11

against the Sacklers?

12

logical inference?

MR. LIPSON:

That didnโt jump out to you as the

Honor --

15

THE COURT:

Is there any other -- is there any

16

other, given the fact that they did not allege and

everything that you have heard today belies the assertion

that the Sacklers have any role in running these debtors

post-bankruptcy?

MR. LIPSON:

We are not saying that they ran the

debtors post-bankruptcy --

THE COURT:

But if Mr.

Thank you.
Okay.

All right.

I have before me a

7

motion by Mr. Jackson, Peter W. Jackson, for the appointment

8

of an examiner in these cases, under Section 1104(c)(1) or

9

(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.

10

I must say that most of this hearing, I think

11

quite appropriately, has dealt with the motion papers and

12

the statements made in them, as opposed to what the movant's

13

counsel, Professor Lipson, has stated, albeit that that

14

differed from the pleading that was filed at 9:30 last

15

night, is really the relief that's being sought as far as

16

the nature of the examination.

17

I think it's important not only to deal with that

18

request for relief, which was really only clarified this

19

morning after extensive prodding, but also the language in

20

the motion.

21

with hundreds of thousands of people, if you count family

22

members, who are not represented by lawyers, who know about

23

the case mostly from what they read or hear about in the

24

media, which, correctly, reads the pleadings and assumes

25

that there is some cogency to what is actually filed.

212-267-6868

I say that because these are very public cases

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I

516-608-2400

Page 138
1

believe that in respect of this motion, those people have

2

been misled, and in fact, sadly misled.

3

Again, this is a public case where tremendous harm

4

is intended to be addressed.

5

certainly no that they have been harmed, and they want to

6

make sure that what comes out of this case is the best

7

result for them.

8
9

The victims of that harm

When it is asserted with no evidence that that
process lacks integrity, and that the fiduciaries, both

10

under the Bankruptcy Code and their own representatives,

11

somehow have misguided motives, or were misled or confused,

12

or somehow acting without integrity, that's a problem.

13

It's particularly a problem when a law professor,

14

who one would think would understand how courts work, would

15

understand that integrity is the fundamental basis of the

16

legal system, suggesting a series of "questions",

17

"concerns", "issues", without any real support that that's

18

not how it's working here.

19

that the Court and the fiduciaries here have some form of

20

backscratching relationship that prevents them from pursuing

21

the right result, as required by the law, with rationales to

22

suggest, for example, that judges may rule one way because

23

that's not as justice requires, but for some other reason,

24

which is unarticulated, but nevertheless laid out as a

25

concern or at issue.

212-267-6868

That goes so far as to state

That the people who practice in the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 139
1

court may for some reason not want to pursue their clients'

2

rights to the full, to the best of their ability, because

3

somehow they want to appear again later in the court in some

4

other matter, as Footnote 15 on Page 17 of the motion

5

suggests, as opposed to doing their best job in the court,

6

in the matter in which they are proceeding, is not only

7

bizarre and totally illogical, but again, simply

8

misrepresents to the public, who are employers, what lawyers

9

do.

10

Of course, it's all qualified by, well, we donโt

11

mean any disrespect or, you know, of course, judges take

12

seriously their rulings, although it's couched in the draft

13

article that's cited as legal authority by saying, well,

14

judges may do that, but sometimes when it's important, they

15

may not, as the discussion of Judge Isgur in Mr. Levitin's

16

article suggests.

17

to determine what was important and not.

18

that Judge Isgur and every other judge in this country,

19

including me, takes every issue before him with the utmost

20

seriousness, and only looks at those issues and none others,

21

and certainly doesn't look into the future as to what might

22

be filed in front of him or her.

23

particularly coming from an academic, is shocking.

24
25

I guess Mr. Levitin left it up to himself
I would tell you

And to suggest otherwise,

Now, as I said during oral argument, at least I

here today, as opposed to just writing a draft article, as

2

his colleague, Mr. Levitin did.

3

sad day when someone who calls themselves an academic, a

4

scholar, engages in that type of ad hoc rationale.

5

But I really think it's a

This motion began on Page 1 with the wonderfully

6

quotable and totally off point, "These cases have been

7

overshadowed by a single critical question.

8

responsible for the Debtors' confessed crimes and the harms

9

they caused?"

10

Who is

And that's what's defined as the Sacklers

allegations, the crimes.

11

And then that paragraph ends by saying, "While the

12

case has involved massive, perhaps a record amount, of

13

discovery, it has been contained among and analyzed by a

14

small group of case insiders.", who are then discussed at

15

Page 17, as I have already described, as somehow people

16

scratching each other's back, and not actually getting to

17

the truth or to justice.

18

And by the way, Mr. Lipson, when I say justice, I

19

don't distinguish between justice and dignitary justice.

20

fact, it's a term I'd never heard before.

21

it up, it comes out of a completely different context than

22

you and your colleague, Mr. Levitin, have used.

23

All justice is dignitary justice.

And when I looked

Justice

before one.

That's inherent in the oath of office, to do justice to the

3

poor and the rich, the same justice.

4

Justice assumes dignity.

These cases are not about crimes.

This is not a

5

criminal case.

6

can you "absolve" the Sackler family and let them get away

7

with it, people are thinking of crimes, or they're thinking

8

of something that a ruling in a civil case cannot confer,

9

moral absolution.

10

When I get letters from people who say, how

That is a different topic, as a law

professor should understand.

11

This is a case about who should pay money, based

12

upon claims, and whether that money is best used in a

14

the very nature of bankruptcy.

23

They talk in vague terms about assessing and reporting on

24

the integrity of the process.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 142
1

this hearing, that process, one could clearly infer from

2

reading these pleadings, involves not only the Debtors but

3

also the Official Unsecured Creditors Committee and, I

4

think, 11 or 10 other committees in this case and the Court.

5

Now, what the relief ultimately being sought here

6

is is quite different from all of that.

As I understand it,

7

what Mr. Lipson is now seeking is that an examiner be

8

appointed to investigate whether the Debtors acted

9

independent of the Sacklers in filing and seeking

10

confirmation of the plan before the Court, which includes

11

within it an agreement between the Debtors and the Sackler

12

families, as set forth in the plan and disclosure statement,

13

which was also negotiated with and signed onto by most of

14

the parties in interest in this case, including the Ad Hoc

15

Group of Consenting States and Governmental Entities and the

16

Official Unsecured Creditors Committee, a much more narrow

17

task for an examiner than the various formulations of the

18

proposed examination set forth in the motion and the reply.

19

Section 1104(c) of the Bankruptcy Code says that

20

if the court does not order the appointment of a trustee

21

under Section 1104, then at any time before the confirmation

22

of a plan on a request of a party in interest or the United

23

States Trustee, and after noticing a hearing, the court

24

shall order the appointment of an examiner to conduct such

25

an investigation of the debtor as is appropriate, including

an investigation of any allegations of fraud, dishonesty,

2

incompetence, misconduct, mismanagement or irregularity in

3

the management of the affairs of the debtor, of or by

4

current or former management of the debtor.

5

Let's just stop there before we get to the two

6

clauses that trigger the foregoing examination.

The named

7

allegations to be investigated, fraud, dishonesty,

8

11

things is within the scope of the examination that is

12

actually being sought by Mr. Lipson.

13

He has not alleged fraud; he has not alleged

14

dishonesty; he has not alleged incompetence, misconduct,

15

mismanagement or irregularity, as far as the decision by the

16

Debtor and the Special Committee to propose the plan.

17

course, those are not the only things that could be

18

investigated, but they give a good indication of what

Congress felt should be investigated.

24

Sacklers, determined to propose and seek confirmation of the

examiner would come out on "the integrity of the process",

8

it's human nature that people will wait and not use what

really is important in this case, that mediation

11

In that context, in addition to the delay and

12

irrelevance of the inquiry, given the roles played by the

13

states, the governmental entities, the Indian tribes, the

14

committee and the subcommittee and the other unofficial

15

committees in this case, the cost simply isn't warranted,

16

nor is the delay warranted.

17

it is clearly, I believe, everyone's hope in this case that

18

funds go out promptly to abate the opioid crisis.

19

That is particularly so since

Professor Lipson also relies on, as I said,

20

Section 1104(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, which again

21

states that, "The Court shall appoint an examiner to conduct

22

an investigation of the Debtor as is appropriate if the

23

Debtors' fixed, liquidated, or unsecured debts, other than

24

debts for goods, services, or taxes, or owing to an insider

25

exceed $5 million."

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 152
1

There is a dispute in the case law as to whether

2

this provision is mandatory, i.e., that an examiner must be

3

appointed if the fixed, liquidated, or unsecured debts,

4

other than debts for goods, services, or taxes, or owing to

5

an insider exceed $5 million.

6

It goes back at least to 1984 where the issue was discussed

7

at length in In re. GHR Companies, 43 B.R. 165 (Bankr. D.

8

Mass. 1984), where that Court that the appointment was not

9

mandatory, in large part, because of the Court's assessment

The dispute is not a new one.

10

of the legislative history and background to the section and

11

the facts present in that case, as well as the statutes'

12

direction to conduct an investigation as is appropriate.

13

In that case, the Court went through an extensive

14

analysis of the legislative history, which I will not repeat

15

here, which reflects, however, I believe, a couple of

16

important points.

17

First, in enacting the 1978 Bankruptcy Code,

18

Congress was considering prior practice in which for public

19

companies above a certain debt threshold, a trustee was

20

appointed automatically, and the SEC had an important

21

statutory role, to protect the interests of public

22

debtholders and public shareholders.

23

that level of third-party supervision was actually, as borne

24

out in practice, not a good thing and, therefore, decided to

25

change those provisions of the Chandler Act in the 1978

212-267-6868

Congress believed that

Page 153
1

Code.

2

There was a considerable back and forth as to

3

whether an examiner would need to be appointed and, if so,

4

under what circumstances in such cases, and there was

5

substantial support for the notion that the Court should

6

discretion to appoint both an examiner and a trustee.

7

Nevertheless, the statute came out as it was drafted, which

8

in one paragraph, (c)(2), appears to make the appointment

9

mandatory, but then in the overall provision pertaining to

10

the investigation makes the nature of the investigation as

11

is appropriate, i.e., in the discretion of the Court.

12

It is clear from the legislative history, and as

13

discussed in the In re. GHR Companies, that Congress was

14

focused largely on public companies with public debt and

15

public equity or public equity, although the statute itself

16

does not limit it to public debt, but rather instead to

17

fixed, liquidated, unsecured debts, other than debts for

18

goods, services, or taxes, or owing to an insider.

19

It's probably safe to say that Congress did not

20

have in mind when it drafted this a case where the claims

21

asserted, other than the claims for goods, services, or

22

taxes, would not be funded debt, but instead would be debt

23

for personal injury and the like.

24
25

The Court's continued -- well, I would cite
Professor Lipson's article, in addition to the legislative

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 154

history discussed in the GHR case, which it goes through

2

this similar analysis and notes, among other things, that

3

the provision as drafted was "ASOP" to the SEC; that quote

4

is from an unnamed party who Professor Lipson said was

5

involved in the negotiations of the language that appears

6

now in the Code.

7

The issue of whether the appointment is mandatory

8

proceeded and still proceeds to this day in the case law and

9

commentary.

Indeed, as originally drafted in prior editions

10

of the leading treatise on bankruptcy, "Collier on

11

Bankruptcy," the section suggested that the Court had

12

discretion under (c)(2).

13

The current discussion in Collier is somewhat

14

schizophrenic.

It now states in, again, paragraph

15

1104.03(2)(b) headed, "The Court's lack of discretion once 5

16

million threshold is met," that "Section 104(c)(2) does not

17

leave any room for the Court to exercise discretion about

18

whether an examiner should be appointed as long as the 5

19

million threshold is met and a motion for an appointment of

20

an examiner is made by a party in interest."

21

It then goes on to state, however:

"Nevertheless,

22

the mandatory nature of this provision was not intended and

23

should not be relied on to permit blatant interference with

24

the Chapter 11 case or the plan confirmation process.

supporting its litigation position under the guise of an

6

investigation.

7

8

discretionary appointment, the appointment is not

9

mandatory."

10

In addition, where the parties do not seek

The editors then go on to state:

"Alternatively,

11

a Court might grant their request for an examiner, but so

12

limit the role assigned to the examiner that substantial

interference will be prevented.

14

1104(c) states that the Court shall order the appointment of

15

an examiner to conduct such an investigation of the Debtor

16

as is appropriate."

17

As noted above, Section

"The limitations and prescriptions regarding the

18

scope of the investigation are subject only to the sound

discretion of the bankruptcy judge.

20

investigation, rather than an evaluation.

2

(c)(2).

3

Judge Carey in Spansion actually stated the

4

obvious, "If the Court concludes that there is no basis for

5

an appropriate examination, what is the point of appointing

6

an examiner just to sit there and do thing," highlighting, I

7

think, the compromise that Congress made when it enacted

8

this provision, i.e., 1104(c), and I believe the desire of

9

those parties to just leave it up to the Court as to what is

10

appropriate if there is no basis to not appointment an

11

examiner.

12

In the Residential Capital case, Judge Glenn

13

stated the requirement for the appointment of an examiner

14

under 1104(c)(2) as one requiring, "That a Court order the

15

appointment of an examiner when (1) no plan has been

16

confirmed, (2) no trustee has been appointed, (3) the Debtor

17

has in excess of 5 million in fixed debts, and (4) the facts

18

and circumstances of a case do not render the appointment of

19

an examiner inappropriate," 474 B.R. 121.

20

He then goes on to lay out the circumstances under

21

which such an appointment would not be appropriate.

22

disagree with him as to the burden of proof on that issue.

23

I think probably those opposing the appointment would need

24

to show it.

25

I might

But if they do show it, I agree with him that if,

1

in fact, the same investigation or substantially the same

2

investigation is well underway already either by an estate

3

fiduciary or by a third party with clearly a strong interest

4

to pursue that investigation, one should ordinarily believe

5

that the examination would be inappropriate; that is, the

6

appointment of an examiner to conduct a duplicate

7

examination would be inappropriate, which frankly, is common

8

sense.

9

He also notes the timing points that I've already

10

mentioned that were raised in a number of cases, including

11

the Loral opinion that I've cited, the Schepps opinion that

12

I cited, and In re. Bradley Stores, Inc., 209 B.R. 36,

13

(Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1997).

14

It's also worth quoting from a lengthy transcript

15

by Judge Walrath in the Washington Mutual bankruptcy case,

16

which is also cited in the Residential Capital opinion as

20

that 1104(c)(2) gives the Court some discretion, even if the

21

debt level is reached, and the discretion is that the Court

has the discretion to determine what appropriate

23

investigation of the Debtor should occur, and that if the

Court determines that there's no appropriate investigation

that needs to be conducted, the Court has the discretion to

13

In that case, Judge Walrath stated that it was a

14

very close call as to whether to appoint an examiner since

15

she did not find that it was a litigation tactic, but that

16

she concluded that "The appointment of an examiner here

really would -- an examiner really would only have the task

of reviewing what others have already done.

think that's just a waste of assets."

That's found at In re. Washington Mutual, Inc.,

97 through 101.

6

Other courts have actually done what Collier

7

suggests and simply appointed an examiner but then had them

do nothing, or in the case of In re. Erickson Retirement

Communities, LLC, 425 B.R. 309, 317 (Bankr. N.D. Tex.), the

Court appointed an examiner but then gave that person no

11

meaningful duties as there was no sound purpose for it and

12

said, "Perhaps if the Court does not confirm the plan, an

13

examiner could do something."

14

Finally, the objectors properly focus on the Dewey

15

LeBoeuf case, which I previously cited; again, it's at 478

B.R. 627 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2012).

that it had the discretion under Section 1104(c)(2) not to

18

appoint an examiner under those circumstances present there,

19

given that the investigation that the examiner was sought to

20

be done had already been conducted or was nearly complete,

21

and the appointment of an examiner would upend the

22

settlement process and the consideration of the settlement

in connection with the confirmation hearing, in essence,

There, the Court concluded

2

The issue, again, that the motion seeks to have be

3

the subject of the examination is the independence of the

4

Debtor, its board and, more specifically, the special

5

committee of the board in submitting the plan for

6

confirmation.

7

This is, frankly, different than the issues raised

8

in the motion and the reply, which focus on the entire scope

9

of the negotiation of the plan, even before key parties who

10

are supporting the plan were in existence.

11

premised upon the theory that the pre-bankruptcy settlement

12

framework embodied in the term sheet negotiated between, on

13

the one hand, the Sacklers and the Debtors -- then not

14

Debtors, just Purdue -- as defendants in multi-district

15

litigation.

16

The motion is

And the claimants in that litigation, or at least

17

certain of the claimants in that litigation, including the

18

so-called consenting states and the lead personal injury

19

attorneys' committee, was, in fact, a structure that

20

determined the outcome leading to the plan and, therefore,

21

every step from that structure to this moment -- and

22

conceivably, the future -- need to be investigated by the

23

examiner to determine the integrity of the process, using

24

the words of the motion and the reply.

25

This completely ignores that the Debtors are a

contention that the post-petition Debtor was in any way

committee was.

22

The motion and Professor

Again, it's hard for me to see whether the issue

23

itself is particularly relevant, given that there are

24

multiple parties in interest who conducted extensive

25

investigations of claims against the Sacklers besides the

516-608-2400

Page 164

Debtors, although, of course, the Debtors did too.

2

the announcement by the Attorney General of the State of New

3

York that she had uncovered in excess of $10 billion of

4

claims for potential avoidable transfers by the Sacklers

5

came from uncovering the first page of the Debtors'

6

extensive report detailing those transactions.

7

Indeed,

There is no real suggestion, except wholly

8

inappropriate innuendo, some of which I addressed during

9

oral argument, that the special committee had some sort of

10

proclivity not to act as independent fiduciaries.

11

again, even if they did, of which there's no evidence, there

12

were plenty of other fiduciaries adamantly in opposition to

13

the Sacklers, well represented, who actively and, in fact, I

14

think uniquely in bankruptcy practice engaged in I believe

15

the most thorough investigation of those claims one can

16

imagine.

17

But

Of course, they considered whether the process

18

itself was affected by the Sacklers' role as shareholders of

19

the Debtor and, of course, if they had reached that

20

conclusion, I would have heard it and, of course, if that

21

were true, I would have appointed a trustee or otherwise

22

directed the Sacklers to have no role.

23

beggars the mind to believe that Professor Lipson is sincere

24

when he says that you cannot rely upon the creditors'

25

committee to have done that inquiry.

disclosure statement hearing if he had.

the Debtors, I would have asked the committee and I would

have asked other parties in interest, do you have any reason

to believe that the Sacklers are directing or influencing

I would have asked

10

this plan.

11

that question is obvious: if the committee did have that

12

belief, it would have raised it, knowing how active,

13

diligent, and committed the members of the committee and its

14

professional are.

15

Although frankly, I believe again the answer to

The Dewey and LeBoeuf case also deals with a

16

second aspect of the issue under Section 1104(c)(2); that

17

is, Judge Glenn in that case analyzes whether the debts in

18

that case as asserted -- and the movant does have the burden

19

of proof on this -- by the movant were, in fact, fixed,

20

liquidated, and unsecured, other than debts for goods,

21

services, or taxes or owing to an insider, in excess of $5

22

million.

23

of cases that state that, at least in most circumstances,

24

the Court must appoint an examiner.

25

Obviously, that's relevant because of the number

As Judge Glenn states in Dewey LeBoeuf, the $5

5

law on what constitutes a fixed and liquidated debt for

6

purposes of Section 1104(c)(2), Blacks Law Dictionary

7

defines fixed debt as, "Generally a permanent form of a

8

debt, commonly evidenced by a bond or debenture; long-term

9

debt".

10

He goes on to state, "While there is little case

Judge Glenn goes on to state, "Conversely, it

11

defines a contingent debt as 'A debt that is not presently

12

fixed but that may become fixed in the future with the

13

occurrence of some event,'".

14

Lastly, it defines a liquidated debt as "A debt

15

whose amount has been determined by agreement of the parties

16

or by operation of law,".

17

Finally, Judge Glenn states "In other bankruptcy

19

the Debtor will be called upon to pay only upon the

20

occurrence or a happening of an extrinsic event which will

6

Dewey LeBoeuf case, which addressed contingencies and

7

concluded that the debts that were being asserted did not

8

fall into the category of "fixed, liquidated unsecured

9

debts."

10

And certainly, contemplating the

There is a substantial question in my mind here as

11

to whether the only debt that is asserted by Professor

12

Lipson as triggering this provision, in fact, falls within

13

the actual language of it.

14

paragraph 6 of the Court's order pursuant to 11 U.S.C.

15

Section 105 and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019,

16

authorizing and approving settlements between the Debtors

17

and the United States.

18

It is the debt set forth in

That settlement contemplated various judgments and

19

payments to be made to the United States in paragraphs 3

20

through 5, all of which are contingent upon the District

21

Court accepting the plea agreement at the sentencing

22

hearing.

23

And then there is the debt that Mr. Lipson relies

24

on set forth in paragraph 6, which states that "The United

25

States shall have an allowed unsubordinated, undisputed,

212-267-6868

non-contingent, liquidated unsecured claim against PPLP,

2

that is Purdue, in the amount of $2.8 billion arising from

3

the DOJ's civil investigation, defined as the civil claim."

4

If you just stopped there, obviously Professor

5

Lipson would be right.

6

"Provided that if PPLP..." and then I'll skip the first

7

proviso and go on to, "... provided that if a plan

8

materially consistent with the terms of the civil settlement

9

agreement is not confirmed", and then goes on to say, "In

10

the event of voluntary dismissal or a conversation of the

11

cases, that is the bankruptcy cases, or in the event the

12

Debtors' obligation under the civil settlement agreement are

13

voided for any reason, the United States may elect in its

14

sole discretion to rescind the releases in the civil

15

settlement agreement and bring any civil and/or

16

administrative claim action or proceeding against the

17

Debtors where the claims that would otherwise be covered by

18

the release provided in paragraph III.3 of the civil

19

settlement agreement or to have an undisputed non-contingent

20

and liquidated allowed unsecured claim against Debtors for

21

the full amount of the DOJ's civil proof of claim."

22

But the paragraph continues,

To me, that is a material contingency that, quite

23

arguably, takes this without the range of a fixed liquidated

24

unsecured debt.

25

All of these conclusions would lead one in a

I will note regarding my concern about how the

fact or the obvious fact that this is not a criminal case, I

8

continue to get correspondence from people who I truly --

9

well, being sorry for them is not enough, I mean, what

10

they've gone through is inexpressible -- but who believe

11

nevertheless because of what they have read that this is a

12

criminal case that will somehow absolve the Sacklers, both

criminally and morally.

15

That is not what this case is

On the other hand, as I said, hundreds of people

16

have worked tirelessly to try to maximize the recovery to

17

undo the injuries that have taken place over decades, and

18

how that is perceived is important because most of the money

believe that somehow that process was not conducted with

21

integrity, that effort is somehow tainted.

22

If people

I believe that Professor Lipson could have gotten

23

to this result much more easily than spewing out what he did

24

in his pleadings, but I am concerned that if I do not

"Court refuses to appoint examiner to determine whether

4

So my inclination here is to appoint one person on

5

his or her own, not with a team, to look at one issue, which

6

is whether the board, and more specifically the special

7

committee, in directing that the Chapter 11 plan before me

8

be filed and pursued was acting independently and not under

9

the direction or influence of the Sacklers.

10

That appointment will not -- and I repeat not --

11

involve an assessment of the prior negotiations or of the 99

12

13

committee or the other millions of pages of the

14

investigation conducted by the Debtors under the auspices of

expect the examiner to need another lawyer, except perhaps

to put in his or her fee application and to review the order
