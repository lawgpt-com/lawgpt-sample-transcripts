Chandler Bing: Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Monica Geller: I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Maitre D': Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Chandler Bing: Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Maitre D': I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Chandler Bing: Is this because of the burrito thing?
Monica Geller: You need to give him money.
Chandler Bing: Give him money? It was a joke!
Monica Geller: No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Chandler Bing: Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Monica Geller: You've got to be smooth about it.
Chandler Bing: Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Maitre D': Of course, sir.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: How did it go?
Chandler Bing: Had the money in the wrong hand.
