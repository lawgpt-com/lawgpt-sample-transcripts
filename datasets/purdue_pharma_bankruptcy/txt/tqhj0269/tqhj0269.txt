P R O C E E D I N G S

2

THE COURT:

All right, good morning, everyone.

3

This is Judge Drain and we’re here on Pharma L.P., et al.,

4

continuing on with the hearing on the Debtor’s request for

5

approval -- confirmation of their amended Chapter 11 plans.

6

I don’t have a formal -- as I’ve had in the past

7

days for this hearing -- list of witnesses who will be

8

testifying today.

9

Family member will be testifying, but if someone can update

10

I understood that a couple of Sackler

me on who exactly will be testifying today.

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Before I turn

12

it over, this is Benjamin Kaminetzky of Davis Polk for the

13

Debtors. Good morning.

14

this case, Katherine Benedict, sent that email to all the

15

parties and to chambers yesterday after the hearing with the

16

list of witnesses, there’s been conversations among, quite

17

frankly, Maryland and the Sackler Families about what

18

exactly and who exactly is going to happen after Richard

19

Sackler.

20

Richard Sackler.

21

discussions about recent deposition testimony, and who and

22

what, and I will leave it to them.

23

So, since the true unsung hero in

So, we’re certainly starting the day with Mr.
After that, I think there’ve been

I did want to, before we -- you know, I turn it

24

over to them -- it seems clear to me, it seems clear I think

25

to everybody, that one way or another we’re going to be done

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

with the testimony tomorrow.

2

the most frequent question we’re getting from the parties,

3

and we’d maybe like the judge to sign off, is when we would

4

start the argument portion of the hearing.

5

request that the Court perhaps set that for Monday, to give

6

the parties adequate time to digest the transcripts, apply

7

the facts to the law, streamline their presentations per

8

Your Honor’s guidance at the pretrial conference, which now

9

feels like 100 years ago.

10

And we would like kind of --

And we kindly

As we suggest to Your Honor and Your Honor agreed,

11

given the overlapping nature of the various objections, we

12

intended to have the argument by topic, and folks need to

13

then coordinate with their co-parties on how they divide up

14

the time.

15

150 people if Your Honor could just say Monday is the day

16

and...

17

So, I think you would hear a collective exhale of

THE COURT:

Right.

That actually is consistent

18

with my own thinking on this.

That if we ended on Thursday,

19

the parties and I would need some time to catch our breath

20

and focus on the record, which makes sense to have argument

21

on Monday.

22

Next Tuesday is not a Purdue day.

23

MR. KAMINETZKY:

24

THE COURT:

25

A Sears day.

I find it hard to believe that oral

argument would take more than a day, but it might.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

So, I

516-608-2400

Page 17
1

could leave a little time for Wednesday.

2

I contemplate giving you my ruling either Thursday or

3

Friday.

4

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Half a day, say.

That’s perfect, Your Honor.

5

Okay, I appreciate that guidance and maybe I’ll -- I think

6

just to answer Your Honor’s question, exactly what’s

7

happening to Mr. Sackler today, I’ll turn it over to Ms.

8

Monaghan and Ms. --

9

THE COURT:

Well, before we get to that, several

10

parties clearly have participated actively in this hearing.

11

They’re not the only parties that have filed either

12

objections or statements in support of the plan.

13

should notify who did that -- parties who either objected to

14

the plan or filed statements in support of the plan should

15

notify the Debtor’s counsel by the close of the hearing

16

tomorrow whether they want to participate in oral argument,

17

so that there can be some -- so that can be factored into

18

the planning for oral argument on Monday.

19

Parties

And if there’s some issue about the length of time

20

that people think they’re going to need, we can discuss it

21

on Friday in a chambers conference.

22

MR. KAMINETZKY:

23

Appreciate it.

24
25

That makes sense, Your Honor.

Send it to me.

THE COURT:

All right.

I mean, there are some

people who really have not wanted to participate in the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 18
1

evidentiary portion of this hearing but who do want to be

2

heard by me.

3

statements, so they can be assured of that already.

4

they should let you know again by the close of the trial,

5

assuming it’s tomorrow, whether they want to speak in

6

addition to what they filed at oral argument.

7
8

I’ve read all the objections and all the
But

Okay, so I gather then that we’re going to proceed
first with testimony by Richard Sackler?

9

MR. EDMUNDS:

Yes, but, Your Honor, there is one -

10

- Brian Edmunds for the State of Maryland -- there’s one

11

matter I think is a preliminary issue that I think we’d as

12

the Court to address, and that is there was some

13

correspondence with the Court last night regarding the

14

implications or -- you know, whether certain documents are

15

wholly admitted or are admitted for the purposes Your Honor

16

has said as the hearing has moved forward in considering

17

particular witnesses who -- through whom the parties tried

18

to introduce them.

19

do, you know, in our case.

20

And I think that that affects what we

THE COURT:

Well, just for the record, which

21

documents are you referring to?

22

chambers but I just sort of tacitly refer to the emails.

23

So, if you could just let me know what documents --

24
25

MR. EDMUNDS:

Sure.

I know there were emails to

It’s the documents that the B

side Sacklers have been attempting to present.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

There are a

516-608-2400

Page 19
1

number of documents.

There are documents, I think, that

2

were, as I understand it, were attached to one of the

3

presentations that we considered -- Your Honor considered

4

with respect to Mr. Dubel’s testimony.

5

testified that the Special Committee received presentations.

6

We objected to the documents coming in through that.

7

think Your Honor said they were not -- would not be admitted

8

for their truth.

Mr. Dubel had

And I

9

There are also documents that were attached to --

10

or part of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of

11

law attached to Mr. Joseph’s declaration and also related to

12

Professor Hamermesh’s expert report that Your Honor ruled

13

would come in for the estate claims.

14

I believe that his opinions were admitted for the estate --

15

in relation to the estate’s claims, but not in relation to

16

the state’s claims.

17

accordance with Rule 703, did not necessarily come in for

18

their truth because -- just because Professor Hamermesh’s

19

opinions were admitted for the limited purpose.

20

And I believe -- well,

And that the underlying documents, in

So, I just want to -- my understanding of the

21

scheduling order that Your Honor entered is that there is a

22

process for designating exhibits and initial exhibit lists,

23

and parties were to make objections to them to the extent

24

objections could be made.

25

evidence, the admission of exhibits depends on who and how

212-267-6868

But, again, the admission of

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 20
1

the documents are admitted and the purpose for which they’re

2

used.

3

when the documents would be used.

4

and I just see a reopening that we, frankly, framed our case

5

and our witnesses in the narrow sort of way that Your Honor

6

has suggested we should.

7

I don’t know if these documents come in, we have, you know,

8

more of a case.

And I think that we’ve properly objected at the times

9

THE COURT:

Your Honor has ruled --

And I think we’ve relied on it and

Okay, well, I’m not -- I’m not

10

changing any of the rulings that I made.

11

I asked whether there was any objection to the witness’s

12

testimony, and in some cases there was and I ruled on that

13

objection.

14

else there is to say on that.

15

So, that’s not being revised.

MR. EDMUNDS:

With each witness,

I’m not sure what

That’s -- that’s all I -- all I ask,

16

Your Honor.

17

if other parties object to that or not.

18

think the source of the dispute in the chambers emails last

19

night, and I just wanted to make sure --

20
21

So, I think that we’re fine.

MR. JOSEPH:

But I don’t know
But that was I

Your Honor, if I may.

What we’re

talking about --

22

MR. KAMINETZKY:

I just want to -- I’m sorry, go

23

ahead, Mister -- but let me just say.

24

made your views on these issues so clear so many times, I

25

think it’s -- I’m not sure why we’re arguing about this.

212-267-6868

Your Honor, you’ve

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 21
1

Like, the purpose of what you -- each time this came up,

2

Your Honor ruled and Your Honor made very clear the purposes

3

in which you’re going to be looking at, for example, you

4

know, the Sackler presentation or the complaints.

5

it’s time to move on.

6
7

THE COURT:

10

MR. JOSEPH:

Your Honor, what we’re talking about

are documents un-objected to on the joint exhibit list that
Maryland is now objecting to belatedly.

11
12

Okay, well, I think so too as far as

what I’ve heard so far, unless I’m missing something.

8
9

I think

THE COURT:

Well, when are -- Mr. Edmunds referred

to rulings that I’ve already made as opposed to other --

13

MR. JOSEPH:

Correct.

But there’ve been no

14

rulings on hundreds of exhibits he’s really objecting to.

15

Now, there about 600 exhibits that he has not objected to,

16

did not timely object to that are on the joint exhibit list

17

that he’s now objecting to without identifying them for Your

18

Honor.

19
20

THE COURT:

Well, I haven’t heard an objection.

I

haven’t heard an objection by Mr. Edmunds.

21

MR. JOSEPH:

THE COURT:

Then that’s fine, Your Honor -I thought he was referring to --

23

excuse me -- testimony that I asked whether anyone objected

24

to, and exhibits related to that testimony, and I did rule

25

on that.

this point.

MR. JOSEPH:

10

It’s a point for oral

As with any large trial, and this is no

As with almost every

attention number in the teens, maybe the 20s or 30s.

11

I don’t think any judge should be expected to read

12

all of the exhibits without being told which exhibit is

13

important, and I don’t intend to.

14

it’s important, they need to bring it to my notice.

15

there’s an issue then, I can deal with it.

16

be that you all are arguing about something that is

17

completely academic.

18

filled with boxes of exhibits and I can tell you right now,

19

unless people are going to show me the designations and tell

20

me why they’re important, for example, I’m not going to read

you all are fighting over at this point.

I think if someone thinks

Your Honor, that was precisely my

Exhibits are admitted through the testimony

516-608-2400

Page 23

what purpose they are being put in a box until a witness

2

testifies.

3

THE COURT:

That’s true and -- I agree with that,

4

Mr. Edmunds.

And I also agree with you that an exhibit that

5

may be admitted, I don’t know for what purpose it’s being

6

offered, and I’m not sure the parties do either.

7

there may be plenty of exhibits that someone wants to

8

discuss at oral argument that are not the subject of

9

someone's testimony.

So, again,

And it seems to me that if someone

10

wants to say at that point, I agree to its admission for

11

your consideration as to the pros and cons of the settlement

12

but not as to the underlying merits of the claims that are

13

being settled, in all likelihood I will grant that -- or I

14

will limit its admission to that -- in that way, consistent

15

with how I’ve done so far.

16

So, I thin going -- I hope that gives you some

17

guidance, Mr. Edmunds, as to -- and the other parties -- as

18

to what you want to get out on the record going forward over

19

the next two days.

20
21

MR. EDMUNDS:

No, thank you, Your Honor, that is -

- that’s what we were asking.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. MUHA:

Okay.

So, thank you.
All right, very well.

Your Honor, this is Andy Muha,

24

insurance coverage counsel for the Debtors with Reed Smith.

25

I have one other housekeeping matter that I’d like to bring

Page 24

up before we begin today’s testimony, if it would please the

2

Court.

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. MUHA:

Okay.
Your Honor, the Debtors have reached

5

two stipulations with insurers who have asserted objections

6

to the plan and would have raised certain evidentiary issues

7

or objections.

8

insurers’ substantive objections to plan confirmation, but

9

they do resolve the insurers’ evidentiary issues.

10

The stipulations do not resolve the

The first stipulation is between the Debtors and

11

the group of insurers who, on August 10th, filed the motion

12

in limine to exclude evidence related solely to insurance

13

coverage and to strike insurance-related testimony in

14

Debtor’s declarations.

15

Number 3514.

16

that motion in limine.

Is there counsel on the phone,

MS. GOSTIN:

Your Honor, this is Isley Gostin,

WilmerHale, on behalf of Navigators Specialty Insurance

23

Company.

24

is correct.

25

We agree with the Debtor’s representation.
Thank you.

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

That

Okay, very well.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

Thank you.

516-608-2400

Page 25
1

MR. MUHA:

And, Your Honor, as a consequence of

2

that stipulation, the Debtors will not be offering the

3

declaration of Lianna Simmons into evidence at the

4

confirmation hearing, and we will not be calling Ms. Simmons

5

as a witness in these proceedings.

6

officially remove her from the list of witnesses remaining

7

to be called.

8
9

THE COURT:

And her declaration was really

just a list of -- a list of letters, basically.

10
11

Okay.

So Your Honor can

MR. MUHA:

It referred to -- yes, yes, exactly,

Your Honor.

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. MUHA:

Very well.
The second stipulation that we have,

14

Your Honor, is between the Debtors on the one hand and Gulf

15

Underwriters Insurance Company and St. Paul Fire & Marine

16

Insurance Company on the other hand.

17

resolves certain evidentiary issues raised in connection

18

with those insurer’s objection to plan confirmation.

19

believe their counsel, Mr. Russell, is also on the Zoom

20

hearing and can confirm that.

21

MR. RUSSELL:

This stipulation

And I

Yes, Your Honor, I can confirm that.

22

William Russell on behalf of Gulf Underwriters Insurance

23

Company and St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company.

24
25

THE COURT:

Okay, so I’m not sure whether there

was an actual motion in limine filed by these two insurers,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 26
1

or whether there was just the potential that there would be

2

an objection.

3

MR. RUSSELL:

Your Honor, it’s not so much that we

4

had a motion in limine but it should obviate our need to

5

recall Mr. DelConte as a witness to cross-examine.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. RUSSELL:

8

MR. MUHA:

9

All right.

That’s fine.

Thank you, Your Honor.

And with respect to that, Your Honor,

as you’ll recall, when Mr. DelConte ended his testimony last

10

week, it was subject to being called back for cross by both

11

Gulf and the other insurers who had joined the motion in

12

limine.

13

the stipulating insurers will be needing Mr. DelConte to

14

come back for cross.

15

THE COURT:

16

But by operation of these two stipulations, none of

So -All right, so his testimony is

finished at this point?

17

MR. MUHA:

18

- as far as we understand it.

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. MUHA:

That’s correct, Your Honor, as far as -

Okay.
Both stipulations have now been filed,

21

Your Honor.

22

is filed at document number -- Docket Number 3588, and a

23

stipulation resolving the evidentiary issues raised by Gulf

24

and St. Paul Marine & Fire has been filed at Docket 3589.

25

The stipulation resolving the motion in limine

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Okay.

All right.

Veritext Legal Solutions

MR. MUHA:

Thank you, Your Honor.

3

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, Matthew Gold from Kleinberg

4

Kaplan.

May I address Your Honor’s comments regarding

5

evidence from a few moments ago?

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. GOLD:

Okay.
Thank you, Your Honor.

I just want to

8

observe in what we thought would be timesaving for all

9

parties.

We stipulated with the Debtors and various Sackler

10

sides to have many of our exhibits admitted without the need

11

of testimony or court time to have them be put in.

12

completely understand Your Honor’s suggestion that we need

13

to be directed as to which exhibits we consider important to

14

meaningful, but I’m trying to understand the best vehicle.

15

Because it seems to me, there are two possible ways we could

16

do that.

17

And I

Either we would have to spend time during oral

18

arguments reviewing what was put in to direct Your Honor to

19

what we considered important; or we could submit some kind

20

of post-trial brief or something that would draw those

21

matters to your attention, Your Honor.

22

which would be preferable to the Court.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. GOLD:

25

And I’m inquiring

The former.
Okay, thank you, Your Honor.

It’ just

Page 28

THE COURT:

might as well mention it.

3
4

I mean, if it’s that important, you

MR. GOLD:

We certainly will and we will make sure

to include that in our oral argument presentation.

5

THE COURT:

And I know you wouldn’t do this, but I

6

just want to make sure no attorney is just going to spend 15

7

minutes of his or her oral argument just giving me a list of

8

exhibits and saying these are important.

9

me why.

10

You need to tell

It’s part of oral argument.
MR. GOLD:

No, no, I understand, Your Honor.

11

Boring the Court and the (indiscernible) would not be

12

productive.

13

THE COURT:

Few things are more frustrating to a

14

trial judge than seeing, you know, 200 binders of exhibits

15

and someone who actually thinks that he or she is supposed

16

to make sense of them in the context of someone’s

17

presentation when it’s not highlighted.

18

harder for the Appellate Court, of course, because they’re

19

reviewing what the trial court considered.

20

So -- and I know you’ll do that.

And it’s even

I’m not -- I’m

21

not saying that you wouldn’t.

22

would just give me a list of things in the last part of your

23

argument.

But just so everyone is clear on this point.

24

MR. GOLD:

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

And I’m not saying that you

Thank you, Your Honor.
And there’s no -- at the risk of

overkill, your clients have a stipulation with the Debtors.

That governs all the exhibits as far as you and the Debtors

are concerned.

stipulation.

And, frankly, I think we’re basically at the

to get him on, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

DR. SACKLER:

You’re on mute.

Do you swear or affirm to tell

DR. SACKLER:

About the same time as I left the board of Purdue.

Okay, and MNP is the entity through which -- I guess

Again, could you specify the time?

Q

Well, do they do it now?

A

I don’t know.

Q

Okay.

Did they do it in 2018, when you left the MNP

board?

11

A

I can’t say it was a majority but some did.

Okay.

From 2018?

No, it was not related to opioid prescribing.

called Adhansia before you left the board in 2018?

13

A

I'm reminded of the name, but I don't recall the drug.

Q

It may have had a different name when it was launched,

Q

And --

-- for probing my memory.

warning that it carries a high potential for abuse and

Does that sound familiar?
Thank you --

Are you aware that Adhansia carries a box

10

A

I don't recollect that, no.

would be inclusion of any allegations related to your

conduct on the board when this drug was launched.

A

Yes.

3

A

I don’t know of any.

4

Q

Are you aware, for instance, that in terms of the

5

Independent Associated Companies, the IACs, that the value

6

of those companies upon sale may be contributed to the

7

trusts for the benefit of the U.S. opioid abatement?

8

A

That is my understanding.

9

Q

Okay.

They may be, yes.

Dr. Sackler, are you aware of any similar

10

abatement plan for the Canadian provinces, municipalities,

11

and first nation tribes?

12

A

I am not.

Q

And isn’t it in fact correct that there is no abatement

plan for Canada under this plan?

I do not know.

Q

Do you agree that Purdue Canada entities are IACs,

17

Independent Associated Companies under the proposed plan?

A

Yes.

And isn’t it true that the net asset value of the IACs

Is it in Dr. Sackler’s view fair that the proceeds

of the settlement are not going to fund abatement under the

are Mr. Underwood’s client.

13

believe -- and I guess it’s been a lot of the day, but I

14

believe that that also requires Debtors, too.

15

believe they have objected to the admission, but it’s my

16

understanding that they will consent.

17

THE COURT:

Okay.

I don’t know who is handling

18

that, Mr. Kaminetzky or one of your colleagues.

20

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah.

Because I

Did Debtors

We already had email

21

exchanges about this with Mr. Edmunds and we already did

22

consent.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. HUEBNER:

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

You consent?
That’s correct, Your Honor.
Okay.

So I just want to make sure I

have the right exhibit.

MR. EDMUNDS:

Is there an exhibit number for the

I believe so, Your Honor.

4

apologies, I don’t know that I --

5

MS. MONAGHAN:

My

I am not a hundred percent sure

6

that Theresa Sackler’s deposition was part of the previously

7

submitted group.

8

added.

9

But if it’s not, we consent to it being

THE COURT:

All right.

Well, I just need to get a

10

copy of it.

11

should follow the last exhibit which was admitted, which I

12

think was one of Mr. Edmunds’ exhibits.

13

admitted during the last witness testimony.

14

follow that.

15

And if it doesn’t have an exhibit number, it

MS. MONAGHAN:

Yeah.

There were a couple
So it should

I think I counted two.

So

16

it would be the third number after the last number in the

17

current set.

18

THE COURT:

Right.

So can you -- I guess the best

19

thing for you to do, Mr. Edmunds, is to email that to

20

chambers, copying Ms. Monaghan and Mr. Huebner.

21

MR. EDMUNDS:

And --

Will do, Your Honor.
And I just want to make sure it’s the

designate other sections.

MS. MONAGHAN:

It is, Your Honor.

That’s my

understanding.

And just so Your Honor knows, it was a

So there will be one transcript that

covers both days.
MS. MONAGHAN:

11

THE COURT:

Correct.

And has she reviewed and signed off on

the transcript?

13
14

But it’s one

So I think it only needs one exhibit number.

10

12

So it was September 23rd

MS. MONAGHAN:

It’s my understanding that she has.

I will double-check that.

THE COURT:

All right.

Okay.

And I will read

exhibits.

I would expect you would be emphasizing something from the

before or the day before that.

But I think my suggestion to everyone -- in this

MR. EDMUNDS:

We’ll get it in this afternoon, Your

Honor.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

4

MR. EDMUNDS:

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. HIGGINS:

Thank you.
Thank you.
Your Honor, this is Ben Higgins for

7

the U.S. Trustee.

8

would just ask that it be circulated to any of the objecting

9

parties.

10

I don’t believe we have that yet.

THE COURT:

That’s fair.

And I

You all have the email

11

list.

You don’t have to include everyone on -- why don’t

12

you do two emails, one to chambers just with the two CCs

13

that I mentioned.

14

out to the broader email list.

And then you can -- someone can send it

15

MR. EDMUNDS:

16

THE COURT:

17

We’ll take care of it,
Okay, very well.

Your Honor.

So where does that

leave us for the rest of the day and tomorrow?

18

MR. EDMUNDS:

So I think that we have three

19

Sackler witnesses tomorrow and then perhaps a final witness

20

who is an investigator from Maryland.

21

speak with Ms. Monaghan tonight about whether we will need

22

those witnesses to testify live or place on the record some

23

other arrangement.

24

Huebner will correct me if I am wrong -- that is the close

25

of evidence in the hearing.

212-267-6868

We have agreed to

But then I believe -- and I think Mr.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 151
1
2

So we don’t know yet whether they will testify,
but we’re going to discuss it and see where we are.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

I would ask you to, just as you

4

did and just as the Ad Hoc lawyers did yesterday, get us the

5

exhibits that you expect to be discussing with these

6

witnesses early so that I can have copies of them on the

7

bench and of course so the witness can have them, too.

8

Hopefully before -- hopefully tonight as opposed to tomorrow

9

morning.

10

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, I do need to make an

11

unfortunate contingent correction of Mr. Edmunds.

12

working like mad day and night to resolve the remaining

13

issues with the so-called codefendants, which are really

14

important counterparties to the Debtors.

15

remember, they reserved their right to cross-examine a

16

couple of our witnesses.

17

necessary and that we will get to a deal.

18

reason that fails, which would be terrible, then in addition

19

to the three witnesses or four potential witnesses that Mr.

20

Edmunds mentioned I believe, we may be seeing some recall of

21

a couple of other witnesses.

22

and optimistic that that will not be necessary.

23

THE COURT:

We are

As the Court may

(indiscernible) that will not be

Okay.

But if for some

But I still remain passionate

That’s fine.

I mean, I really

24

would like to finish if we can tomorrow.

25

today’s witness took a long time, but that was appropriate I

I know that

felt.

2

But do you have a sense that we’ll be done

3

tomorrow, Mr. Edmunds?

4

can control.

5

that’s not really your issue.

6
7

10

Barring unforeseen circumstances,

Your Honor, I think that we will be finished tomorrow.
THE COURT:

All right.

we should start early or not.

I’m just wondering whether

It sounds like we could start

at 10:00.

11
12

Don’t address Mr. Huebner’s point because

MR. EDMUNDS:

8
9

It’s only over the things that you

MR. EDMUNDS:

Yes.

I don’t think there’s any

need.

13

MR. JOSEPH:

14

THE COURT:

Your Honor, may I ask -One more question, Mr. Joseph.

And we

15

don’t have a witness who, like, disappears and turns into a

16

pumpkin at some -- you know, at 2:30 or anything like that?

17

MS. MONAGHAN:

So, Your Honor, we do have one of

18

the three witnesses who is overseas.

19

Mr. Edmunds I think is amenable that he would go first if

20

they go.

21

THE COURT:

22

MS. MONAGHAN:

And so I think -- and

All right.
And then the other point -- I don’t

23

know if Mr. O’Neill is on, Mr. Robinson O’Neill -- is one of

24

the other witnesses is the subject of the stipulation with

25

Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, and D.C., pursuant to which

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 153
1

they have agreed to forego questioning her in exchange for

2

her deposition being included and a stipulation to certain

3

biographical facts that came across kind of disjointedly in

4

the deposition that they wanted in a single document.

5

that will be submitted as well.

6
7

THE COURT:

10

MR. O’NEILL:

12

MR. O’NEILL:
yet.

THE COURT:

15

MR. O’NEILL:

Okay.

But Maryland has not agreed to that

I understand.
-- Oregon, Connecticut, D.C., and

MS. MONAGHAN:

Yes.

I apologize.

I wasn’t trying

to imply that Maryland --

I don’t think you stated -- I don’t

think you said Maryland.

Mr. O’Neill, that’s

your understanding, too?

8
9

Okay.

So

Okay.

All right.
At this point in the hearing, any

slip is possible.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

All right.

So, Mr. Joseph, you were

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 154
1

going to say something?

2

MR. JOSEPH:

Yes, Your Honor.

I just would

3

appreciate it if we could get from Mr. Edmunds some clarity

4

as to whether the investigator will testify.

5

will be cross of the investigator if he testifies.

6

record if they are considering stipulating to depositions is

7

pretty much set.

8

to wait until the record was set before making that

9

determination.

10

And the

And I know Mr. Edmunds legitimately wanted

THE COURT:

All right.

Well, I don’t know -- I

11

mean, are you in a position to do that now?

12

tonight you can.

13

Because there

MR. EDMUNDS:

Or maybe later

I think it’s fair to ask, and I

14

think it’s unlikely he will testify.

15

process what happened in the examination of the witness and

16

what else is going on with these.

17

--

18

THE COURT:
interrupt.

20

don’t know, by 8:00 tonight.

22

Let me ask that you reach out to Mr. Joseph, I

MR. EDMUNDS:

Is that fair?

Yeah, that’s fine, Your Honor.

I’ll

do that.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. EDMUNDS:

25

But that’s the best I can

Let me ask you -- I’m sorry to

19

21

I need to kind of

Okay.
The other thing I was going to say

about Ilene Sackler is that Matt Gold’s office

So you should have it.

THE COURT:

I recall that.

she might be called today.

5

MR. EDMUNDS:

6

THE COURT:

If not -Because I was thinking

So we have a copy of that.

Okay.
But I’m not sure it’s an exhibit yet.

7

So again, we should probably designate it -- you should be

8

ready to designate it as an exhibit.

9

MR. EDMUNDS:

Right.

And we’ll have a stipulation

10

that will go in as well that kind of clarifies.

11

anticipate offering that tomorrow when we finalize it, and

12

hopefully Maryland will agree.

13

THE COURT:

Right.

Okay, very well.

And I would

All right.

14

I think hearing no one else, I think that will end the

15

hearing for today.
