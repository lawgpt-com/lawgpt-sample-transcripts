Chandler Bing: Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Monica Geller: Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Ross Geller: Hey!
#ALL#: Hey!
Ross Geller: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Monica Geller: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ross Geller: We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Ross Geller: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Monica Geller: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Ross Geller: You get the dollhouse.
Monica Geller: I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Phoebe Buffay: No, just a barrel.
Monica Geller: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Phoebe Buffay: Really?! Really?!
Monica Geller: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Chandler Bing: My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
