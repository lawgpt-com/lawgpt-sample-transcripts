Ross Geller: What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Guest #1: See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Ross Geller: You chipped in?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Ross Geller: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Ross Geller: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Phoebe Buffay: No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Steve Cera: Oh hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Steve Cera: Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
