Chandler Bing: You have no trouble telling time now right?
Monica Geller: No!
Chandler Bing: Quick! What time is it?!
Monica Geller: I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Chandler Bing: Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Monica Geller: Yeah?
Chandler Bing: Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Monica Geller: Ohh, absolutely.
Ross Geller: And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Monica Geller: Yeah, definitely!
Ross Geller: Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Monica Geller: Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Ross Geller: Man!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
