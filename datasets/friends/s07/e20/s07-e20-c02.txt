Monica Geller: Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Rachel Green: Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Monica Geller: Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Chandler Bing: This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Monica Geller: Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Joey Tribbiani: Hello!
Rachel Green: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Rach.
Rachel Green: Stop picturing it!!
Monica Geller: Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Monica Geller: Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Joey Tribbiani: What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Monica Geller: Why would they think they're invited?
Joey Tribbiani: You got me. I don't...
Monica Geller: Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Monica Geller: Ross's parents are my parents!
Joey Tribbiani: Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Chandler Bing: Y'know I think we should invite them.
Monica Geller: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Chandler Bing: Well this is just sad!
Monica Geller: All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Rachel Green: That is not a problem.
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Rachel Green: Oh, get out of here!
