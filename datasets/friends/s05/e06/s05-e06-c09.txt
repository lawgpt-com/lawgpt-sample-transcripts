Rachel Green: Hi!
Danny: So you like the short hair better.
Rachel Green: What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Danny: I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Rachel Green: Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Danny: Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
Rachel Green: What?
Danny: That's cool. Cool.
Rachel Green: What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Danny: Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
Rachel Green: So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Danny: Do you?
Rachel Green: Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Danny: Okay.
Rachel Green: And stop saying that! I hate that!
Danny: Okay!

Rachel Green: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Danny: The pizza-place across the street any good?
Rachel Green: What?!
Danny: I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Rachel Green: Okay. Okay.
Danny: Stop saying that. I hate that.
