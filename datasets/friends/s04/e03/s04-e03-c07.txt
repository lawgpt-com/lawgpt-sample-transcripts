Chandler Bing: Thanks.
Joanna: No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Joanna: What are you doing?
Chandler Bing: I'm getting dressed.
Joanna: Why?
Chandler Bing: When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Joanna: Wait. I wanna show you something.
Chandler Bing: What is it?
Joanna: Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Chandler Bing: Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Joanna: I'll be back in ten minutes.
Chandler Bing: You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Joanna: Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Chandler Bing: Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!

Joanna: Oh.
Sophie: Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Joanna: Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
Rachel Green: That's weird, she locked the door.
Sophie: Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Rachel Green: Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
Sophie: Yeah!
