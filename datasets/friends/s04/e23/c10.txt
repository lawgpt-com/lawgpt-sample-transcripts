Emily Waltham: Hello?
Ross Geller: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Emily Waltham: We don't have to.
Ross Geller: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Emily Waltham: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ross Geller: She said what?
Emily Waltham: She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Ross Geller: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
Emily Waltham: I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Ross Geller: I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Emily Waltham: Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Ross Geller: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Emily Waltham: So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Ross Geller: No. I'm saying it's now.
Emily Waltham: Or?
Ross Geller: There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Emily Waltham: It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Ross Geller: No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
