Chandler Bing: Ohh. Mmm.
Rachel Green: Hi.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Rachel Green: Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Chandler Bing: It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Rachel Green: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Chandler Bing: I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Rachel Green: Why, why not?
Chandler Bing: Because it's too delicious.
Rachel Green: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Chandler Bing: No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Rachel Green: Oh, I'm sorry what?
