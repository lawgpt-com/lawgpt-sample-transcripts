Ross Geller: So where are we going next?
Gary: This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Chandler Bing: Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Joey Tribbiani: Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Gary: It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Ross Geller: Yeah, no one talks like that!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Ross Geller: Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Chandler Bing: How do you figure that?
Ross Geller: Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Chandler Bing: Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Ross Geller: Umm, jealous!
Gary: Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Ross Geller: Yeah, no problem.
Gary: Ross!
Ross Geller: Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
