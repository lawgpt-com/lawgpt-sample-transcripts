Joey Tribbiani: Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
The Director: Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm having surgery!
The Director: What?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
The Director: What kind of surgery?!
Joey Tribbiani: Transplant.
The Director: But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Joey Tribbiani: Hair transplant.
The Director: But you're not bald.
Joey Tribbiani: It's not on my head.
The Director: Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
Richard Burke: I'm wearing two belts.
Joey Tribbiani: Are you drunk?
Richard Burke: No!
Joey Tribbiani: Yes you are!
Richard Burke: All right.
