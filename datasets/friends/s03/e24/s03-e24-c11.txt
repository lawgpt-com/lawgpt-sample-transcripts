Chandler Bing: Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Doug: Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Chandler Bing: No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Doug: Oh, you forgot?
Chandler Bing: No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Doug: Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Chandler Bing: Doug!!
Doug: Hmm.
Chandler Bing: I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Doug: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Chandler Bing: No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Doug: Oh?
Chandler Bing: Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Doug: Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Doug: Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Chandler Bing: Ahhhhh!
