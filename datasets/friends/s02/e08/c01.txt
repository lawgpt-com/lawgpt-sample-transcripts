Rachel Green: Ross kissed me.
Monica Geller: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Rachel Green: It was unbelievable!
Monica Geller: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Rachel Green: Oh, it ended very well.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Monica Geller: Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Rachel Green: Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Rachel Green: No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Monica Geller: Ohhhh.
