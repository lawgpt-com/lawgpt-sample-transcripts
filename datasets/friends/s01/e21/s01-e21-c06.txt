Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Where've you been?
Ross Geller: At the vet.
Chandler Bing: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Ross Geller: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! He beat ya.
Ross Geller: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
