Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Eric: Welcome back!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
Eric: I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Phoebe Buffay: Why?
Eric: Uh, the sex.
Phoebe Buffay: What sex?
Eric: Our sex.
Phoebe Buffay: We didn't have sex.
Eric: Well if I didn't have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like...
Phoebe Buffay: Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Eric: Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Phoebe Buffay: You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
Eric: Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and...
Phoebe Buffay: You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Eric: Well I was just so excited to see you.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
Eric: No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
Phoebe Buffay: So I guess this is it.
Eric: Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, so do you.
