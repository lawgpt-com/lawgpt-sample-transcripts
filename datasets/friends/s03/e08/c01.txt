Rachel Green: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Chandler Bing: I will have one.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Ross Geller: Neither will I.
Phoebe Buffay: No, no, it's just my tooth.
Chandler Bing: All right I'll have one.
Ross Geller: So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
Phoebe Buffay: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Chandler Bing: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ross Geller: Why? Why can't you go to him?
Phoebe Buffay: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Chandler Bing: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Rachel Green: And all these people actually died?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ross Geller: Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Phoebe Buffay: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
