MR. HUEBNER:

Huebner, yes.

May it please the Court,

16

your permission, I will address three main points

18

in my 18 opening minutes and reserve the balance

19

for rebuttal.

20

With

First, this Court's 34 years of

21

unbroken precedent compels reversal.

22

District Court is the only Court anywhere ever to

23

deem the legality of appropriate third-party

24

releases unsettled in the circuit.

25

fiduciaries, mediators, and victims relied on

The

The

516-608-2400

Page 6
1

this Court's precedent for over three years in

2

crafting a value-maximizing life saving plan.

3

Second, even if this Court could or did

4

reconsider the legal issue anew, its precedent is

5

firmly rooted in the code.

6

Third, this case, illustrates exactly

7

why third-party releases are necessary in rare

8

and unusual cases, to protect the bankruptcy race

9

and enable reorganization.

Judge Drain's

10

undisputed findings are that continued litigation

11

of the claims at issue would, one, likely result

12

in the liquidation of these operating Debtors;

13

two, gravely impair the estates' other critical

14

assets.

15

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

So it's the

16

significance of the settlement that drives the

17

scope of the bankruptcy judge's authority?

MR. HUEBNER:
apologize.

20
21

Your Honor, it's -- I

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

No, no, that --

no.

MR. HUEBNER:

It is the impact of the

23

third-party actions on the race of the

24

bankruptcy.

25

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

So the greater

516-608-2400

the impact of the non-Debtor, the greater the

2

ability of the Court to interfere with the rights

3

of non-parties, parties who have no claims

4

against the bankrupt themselves perhaps?

MR. HUEBNER:

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

My question is, what's the limiting

16

MR. HUEBNER:

17

least three limiting principles.

18

the jurisdictional question which is set forth

19

obviously in many of this Court's decisions,

20

including SPV Osus, Quigley, and others.

21

Your Honor, there are at
Number one is

The second is the test you set forth in

22

Metromedia, affirmed on Page 88 of Madoff, and

jurisdiction and authority when the race of the

The decisions in

2

then of course, Metromedia sets forth while the

3

Court's exact words are, "It is not a matter of

4

factors and prongs," it said that "truly unusual

5

circumstances are necessary," and then lists

6

several fact patterns:

potential insurance policies; secondly, is the

HON. EUNICE LEE:

So with regard to the

effect on the race, the claims, some of the

claims that are being released, I mean, this is a

4

very broad release.

5

-- I mean, it covers their broader -- it's a

6

broader release than prior cases have really

7

addressed and how is it that these claims, in

8

fact, all have an impact, a direct impact on the

9

race?

10

How is it that they actually

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, respectfully,

11

the releases are actually much narrower than

12

releases in prior cases.

In fact, let's take the example of
Drexel was securities fraud cases

Again, in our case Your Honor,

important --

11

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Drexel is a class

12

action where Judge Pollock pulled the class

13

action out of -- pulled it into District Court.

14

It's still within the context of bankruptcy so

15

you can't just say it's just a class action; I

16

get that.

17

there were folks who had -- both key litigants

18

who had claims against -- with regard to breach

19

of fiduciary duties or other, perhaps securities

20

21

claims necessarily against Drexel.

But they were

3

a unique situation in that you had claims that

4

may not necessarily have been against the estate

5

and had some, you know, connection to activity by

6

some of the junk bond purveyors, but ultimately,

7

that they were paid.

8

Judge Jacobs is wrong in Metromedia to say that

9

those claimants in Drexel weren't paid.

So, it's -- Drexel is kind of

By the way, my good friend,

he says, well, Drexel and the case that it relies

on which is the Fourth Circuit, relies upon

Section 105, but jeez, you take 105, all it says

is just kind of general powers of the Court and

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, weave

together if I may, answers to all of those

questions and do the best I can because they

actually all relate, and this case I think

threads all those issues in our view and in the

Madoff I of

Manville I

10

of course predated 524(g).

It was this circuit

11

that created the concept of propriety of third-

12

party releases when necessary to reorganization

and impacting the race.

14

Energy Resources specifically found that

1123(b)(6) which says, and I quote, "A plan may

16

contain any provision appropriate and not

17

inconsistent with the provisions of this title."

18

Two of your sister circuits, the Seventh Circuit

19

in Aero-Dyne and the Sixth Circuit in Dow

21

coupled 1123(b)(6) with 105 and said together

picked up on in multiple decisions, including of

course Madoff III and -- Manville III and IV and

curious because, you know, when we had Manville

notwithstanding that, notwithstanding MacArthur,

18

we said those claims, those direct claims that

19

came out of state statutory schemes against the

20

insurance company, Travelers, were direct claims

21

and based upon Travelers' own concept, right, and

22

what's curious about it is that when it went to

the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court didn't say

MR. HUEBNER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Let me address it directly right now.

All of the

5

alleged inconsistencies with the code are simply

6

not there.

7

that they are not there in most of the instances.

8

Alleged inconsistency number one is 524(e), which

9

merely states a truism.

And in fact, this Court has ruled

The Debtor's discharge

10

does not discharge another party for such debt.

11

You discharge a Debtor, not a debt.

12

rejected the argument that 524(e) has any

13

relevance to third party releases in Manville I

14

where it expressly said, "a release is not a

15

discharge.

16

protections of the discharge."

17

This Court

It offers none of the umbrella

And both in Drexel and Metromedia, the

18

briefs directly argued to this Court that the

19

releases it issued violated 524(e) because they

20

were discharges and this Court said no, there is

21

no conflict with the statue.

22

is --

HON. JON NEWMAN:

5

I'm sorry, I'll try

Does the plan discharge any creditor?
MR. HUEBNER:

No, Your Honor.

What the

6

plan does is it releases -- it discharges only

7

the Debtors and it releases a narrow category of

8

tailored claims consistent with Second Circuit

9

precedent of specific third parties, which in

10

most cases have capacity limitations.

It has to

11

be connected to Purdue in the role with respect

12

to Purdue or as a transferee, and as I said

13

before using the language from Quigley literally

14

verbatim, the Debtor's conduct has to be the

15

legal cause or a legally relevant factor.

16

There's no other discharge of any kind,

17

and you need to be a creditor of Purdue, which no

18

of the -- none of the third-party cases that have

19

approved much broader releases before have ever

20

had.

21

your direct claim is not released at all.

22

releases were tied to the Debtor, to its conduct,

23

and to the estate in ways that are much tighter

24

than in any predecessor case, virtually all of

25

which just released things related to the estate.

212-267-6868

With respect to 524(g), Your Honor, to

2

continue answering your question, the next

3

alleged inconsistency, there is a reason no Court

4

in U.S. history has ever accepted that argument.

5

524(g) is a description of how asbestos releases

6

work and section 111(b) of the public law enacted

7

in 1994 expressly states, passed by Congress,

8

signed by the President, that it is unlawful to

9

draw an inference from 524(g) and (h) about third

10

party releases outside of the asbestos context.

11

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

If the -- if an

12

individual has a claim against the prescriber of

13

OxyContin, who got one of these value savings

14

cards that encouraged additional use of OxyContin

15

from his prescriber and he has a claim against

16

the prescriber and he also has a claim against

17

Purdue, he fits within the claimants easily with

18

that, but he has a claim against the prescriber,

19

too; is his claim against the prescriber

extinguished?

HON. EUNICE LEE:

10

of abuse and even in Metromedia, there was this

acknowledgement that, you know, these releases

perhaps can be okay, but there's a heightened

13

risk of abuse.

14

where the parties being released are the ones

15

determining the contribution and kind of driving

16

the plan, that suggests concerns about abuse or

17

even in future cases, the idea that the parties

18

who are getting the benefit of this release are

19

determining, you know, how much they give, how

20

essential it's going to be to the plan.

21

Can I just -- I'm
One thing, this -- I

And in a situation like this

MR. HUEBNER:

Absolutely Your Honor.

22

If I can tackle -- there were two things in

them both because they're actually so important.

If you don't mind, I'd like to address

abuse.

Now when Metromedia talks about abuse,

2

and I think Judge Wiles' quite actually sharp

3

opinion in Aegean Marine is quite helpful on

4

this.

5

was the abuse of overuse of third-party releases

6

and I think the Courts need to be continuously

7

diligent that the many guardrails and

8

requirements that this and other circuits have

9

set forth are continuously monitored for effect

What the Second Circuit was talking about

10

on the estate jurisdiction, race, substantial

11

contribution, et cetera.

12

That really is what the Court meant by

13

abuse which is are they being overused, and we

14

actually went back and looked at the 80 cases

15

that we cited in our brief, all of them because

16

the government said that shows this has

17

metastasized.

18

many of those cases have turned down third-party

19

releases, which is more than half, about 55

20

percent which means the Courts are doing their

21

job.

their opening bit was to the eventual 4.2

billion.

a proper and fair deal was reached in this case.

clear, this was the creditors plan and the

Judge Lee was concerned that the

And what I'm suggesting to you and

10

asking you, is it a fair inference that their

11

opening bid was pushed up by the mediator.

12

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, let me

13

apologize for missing a pitch.

14

to convey, and I apologize, I obviously did it

15

badly, is there were multiple rounds of mediation

16

between both active judges and retired judges.

17

HON. JON NEWMAN:

What I was trying

Again, is it a fair

18

inference that the mediators pushed the Sacklers

19

up from their opening bid to 4.2?

20

that's a fair inference or it's not.

21

MR. HUEBNER:

Now, either

that right?

4

MR. HUEBNER:

It is, Your Honor.

5

HON. JON NEWMAN:

6

MR. HUEBNER:

Thank you.

And Judge Lee, just to

7

finish answering your question, because the

8

question of abuse and control is a desperately

9

important one, and I want to give you comfort.

10

Judge Newman's point, which I clearly missed, for

11

which I apologize, is that we had multiple rounds

12

of mediation before sitting and former federal

13

judges who oversaw more than a year of fulltime

14

mediation to ensure the fairness and integrity of

15

the process.

16

But the reason I was struggling for a

17

minute is, that's only one of the things that

18

ensure the fairness and the integrity of the

19

process because we had all -- virtually all 50

20

state attorneys general, an Official Committee of

21

Unsecured Creditors, and eight ad hoc victims

22

groups engaged all day every day in this case,

23

over 300,000 hours of professional time poised

opposite the Sacklers, which is why this plan has

question.

13

claim against the corporation for addiction and

14

they live in a state that allows a direct action,

15

which imposes personal liability on a director or

16

officer.

17

addiction to the trust, to the appropriate fund,

18

one of the seven funds that you've created.

19

right.

20

direct action claim in those states where those

21

claims are allowed?

22

An individual has a personal injury

They make a claim with regard to the

All

And what happens with regard to the

MR. HUEBNER:

So Your Honor, those

23

direct action claims are exactly what is

24

channeled under the plan.

25

core of what the third-party release is for.

212-267-6868

That is in fact the

Veritext Legal Solutions

The

516-608-2400

Page 34
1

Sacklers are paying in $5.5 to $6 billion which

2

is actually the money that is funding --

3

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

4

The answer is,

they're released, right?

5

MR. HUEBNER:

They're channeled Your

6

Honor, and as the TDPs made clear, both your

7

claims against the Sacklers and your claims

8

against Purdue are what constitute the basis for

9

your recovery against the trust.

It's just,

10

there's only one injury, so you measure the

11

injury once.

12

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

So the release

13

runs to the Sacklers, releasing them individually

14

with regard to direct claims that state law

15

authorizes with regard to various activity of

16

corporate officers and imposes a direct personal

17

liability on the director, not -- for which

18

reimbursement can't be sought from the

19

corporation but which the officer or director is

20

a member.

21

MR. HUEBNER:

So Your Honor, I think

22

the laws may be complicated as to whether

23

reimbursement could be sought from the

24

corporation and whether they could --

25

MR. HUEBNER:

So Your Honor, this is

exactly like every third-party release case ever.

MR. HUEBNER:

I mean, Your Honor, I

released, that claim otherwise could be

prosecuted under either state or federal law.

And so whether it's MacArthur's claim in Manville

claims in Metromedia, whether it's the breast

another really important point --

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

And they continue

to grow these types of cases.

9

MR. HUEBNER:

Well, interestingly

10

enough, Your Honor, if you think back from a

11

policy perspective, almost every mass tort that

12

has ever hit the bankruptcy system in every

13

circuit in this land was only resolvable through

third party releases.

No doubt.

the Sacklers become absolved because they play a

vital role in settling this case?

HON. EUNICE LEE:

MR. HUEBNER:

No.

Your Honor, on in Madoff,

8

this Court's exact words were, bankruptcy courts

9

have authority "to approve releases of a non-

10

director's independent claims."

That was what

11

you repeated and cited to Page 99 of Tronox and

12

you're right, that is out of Metromedia.

13

Your Honor, if this Court's view is, all of our

14

cases to date rested only on 105 and a bunch of

15

the other cases from the Supreme Court have cited

16

1123(b)(6) also, because that's actually for a

17

plan of reorganization.

18

arguably even on point because it says a plan may

19

contain any provision appropriate and not

20

inconsistent.

Now,

In fact, more closely,

21

And bankruptcy judges all over the code

22

are given leeway, does not discriminate unfairly,

is necessary, necessary for reorganization.

24

There are adjectives there in about 40 places in

warp and woof of what the broad jurisdiction

2

under Celotex and SPV Osus and Quigley and your

3

decisions, Tronox, Manville III, Manville IV, are

4

all about, and never before has a case like this

5

happened where the entire case for two-and-a-half

6

years was only about the third-party claims and

7

after it was mediated, litigated, and negotiated

8

and every group in the case needs this money to

go out to save lives.

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

HON. EUNICE LEE:

The UCC was selected by the U.S. Trustee himself

2

to act as the statutory fiduciary for all of

3

Purdue's unsecured creditors in these cases, and

4

the UCC has faithfully discharged that role in

5

the more than two-and-a-half years since we were

6

appointed.

7

We can therefore say with confidence

8

that the plan, far from being dictated by the

9

Sacklers, is a creditors' plan.

It reflects

10

creditor compromises and advances creditor

11

interests.

12

transfer related claims are strong against the

Sacklers.

14

uncovered and developed virtually all of the

15

evidence that the U.S. Trustee cites.

16

litigation against the Sacklers would take years

17

and tens of millions of dollars at least and

18

success, no matter how likely, is not guaranteed.

19

The U.S. Trustee is correct that the

We know it was Purdue's creditors who

But

In contrast, the settlement

incorporated in the plan does guarantee that

Purdue's claimants will receive billions in

promote abatement and public health goals that

24

could not be achieved outside of a consensual

resolution.

The settlement also is critical to

the reorganization.

Purdue's many creditors

2

negotiated the 20-plus interlocking agreements

3

that allocate value among creditors.

4

Absent the Sackler settlement and

5

release, as Judge Drain found, all of those

6

credit allocation agreements will unravel by

7

their terms and lead to costly inter-creditor

8

litigation that itself could take years and cost

9

tens of millions of dollars.

As Judge Drain also

10

specifically found, the estates cannot withstand

11

the chaos, that kind of chaos and a liquidation

12

with literally no recovery by unsecured creditors

13

would be likely.

14

This is all the more so because in that

15

event the DOJ could assert the full amount of its

16

allegedly $2 billion super priority claim which

17

is more than some estimates of Purdue's entire

18

enterprise value.

19

these reasons recognized that the releases at

20

issue are not only important to the plan, they

21

are absolutely essential.

22

acknowledges that the plan would fail without the

release and no party ever identified at the

There's no provision of

to emphasize on behalf of the States, the

enormous amount of work that went into creating

it's going to sound weird for the victim's lawyer

cravenness of what the Sacklers did here as

officers and directors of this company, and the

damages that they brought on everybody.

17

question that not only applies in this case, but

18

will apply in every future case is, how do you

23

I want to return back to the issue of

24

jurisdiction, the Court's power to enter the

25

releases because I think Judge Wesley, your

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 63
1

instinct is exactly correct.

2

problematic for these releases to be so broad

3

because there's no contouring about jurisdiction.

4

There certainly was probably jurisdiction to

5

release some of these claims, but when you

6

release all claims of all states without regard

7

to whether or not there would be rights of

8

contribution or indemnity by statute or anything

9

else like that, you create a really big problem.

10

It's extremely

And that's an especially bad problem

11

for us because there's literally no connection to

12

the estate at all from our claims.

13

no rights to contribution indemnity or insurance

14

because they haven't established that there's any

15

insurance policy that covers us.

16

established that, you know, the rights of

contribution indemnity with regards to our claims

2

estate there.

3

There's no connection to the

And as the Court -- as you suggested,

4

Judge Wesley, it's also extremely problematic for

5

them to say that well, because they've got a

6

right to withdraw, the Sacklers have a right to

7

withdraw the money if they're sued or, you know,

8

there would be a cascade of events that would

9

happen if there were to be a bunch of suits.

10

That is an extremely problematic way of

11

establishing jurisdiction because that

12

establishes that there were effects on a

13

particular plan.

14

But then you have to leap from the plan

15

to the estate and you're not -- and that is an

16

indirect effect.

17

happens and then in another event happens and

18

that other people do other things, and that's

19

exactly the kind of attenuated indirect

20

connection that can establish jurisdiction under

21

this Court's precedent.

22

to zoom out to focus on the appropriate framework

20

for assessing the statutory question, and that

21

stems from the long line of Supreme Court cases

22

making clear that Congress needs to enact

23

exceedingly clear language if it wants to

24

significantly alter the power of the federal

25

government over private property, as it

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I want

516-608-2400

Page 67
1

articulated most recently in Cowpasture.

2

So, under the plan proponents' view,

3

the code authorizes bankruptcy courts to

4

permanently extinguish causes of action, which

5

are a species of property right as the Court made

6

clear in Zimmerman Brush, but no provision of the

7

bankruptcy code expressly authorizes bankruptcy

8

courts to adopt releases of this sort, as the

9

court indeed remarked in Metromedia.

So

10

constitutional avoidance requires that the code

11

be construed to prohibit the result that the plan

12

proponents are asking for, and that's a very easy

13

way of assessing the statutory claims here.

14

Now, the only response to this that I

15

think the other side has come up with is not that

16

avoidance doesn't apply or it's not that

17

constitutional issues aren't at least deeply

18

implicated.

19

clearly, and I think Judge Newman was getting at

20

this in his colloquy about 1123(b)(6), but the

21

problem is the other side's interpretation of

22

that statute just can't be reconciled with the

23

way the Supreme Court has addressed these general

24

provisions, codifying bankruptcy courts' residual

25

equitable authority as the Energy Resources case

212-267-6868

It's that the bankruptcy code speaks

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 68
1

on which the other side so heavily relies

2

actually underscores.

3

Energy Resources makes clear that all

4

of these statutes, whether it's 105, 1123, or

5

whatever all of these residual equitable powers

6

derive from the traditional understanding that

7

bankruptcy courts, as Courts of equity, have

8

broad authority to "modify creditor-Debtor

9

relationships."

And in assessing statutes of

10

this type, the Supreme Court has repeatedly

11

rejected the idea that the code's general

12

authority provisions are able to accomplish a

13

result that is antithetical not only to the text

14

of the code, but to its structure, purposes, and

15

history.

16

HON. EUNICE LEE:

Well, I think -- I

17

mean, I think the other side's argument is that

18

in fact, this type of release would not be

19

inconsistent with the code and that it's not, in

20

fact, inconsistent with any express provision of

21

the code, so maybe you could you could speak to

22

that specifically.

23

MR. SHIH:

I will, Your Honor.

There's

24

two parts to your question and I want to get at

25

them in reverse.

212-267-6868

So the first question is how
Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 69
1

express does the inconsistency have to be?

And

2

the other side would have you believe that it

3

needs to be expressly forbidden by the bankruptcy

4

code for there to be an inconsistency and that

5

just can't be right under cases like Jevic, Law,

6

and RadLAX.

7

So take Jevic, for example.

That was

8

about the priority ordering that the bankruptcy

9

code sets forth.

Now, those priority orders

10

don't apply to this type of order, called a

11

structured dismissal.

12

bankruptcy code expressly prohibits a bankruptcy

13

court from adopting a structured dismissal that

14

violates the priority provisions.

15

the Supreme Court said in Jevic that the priority

16

provisions are so fundamental to bankruptcy, that

17

the general provisions granting equitable power

18

to the bankruptcy court can't support the

19

exercise of authority. And so analogizing --

20
21

So nothing in the

HON. EUNICE LEE:

Nevertheless,

Can I just jump in

for a second?

22

MR. SHIH:

Yeah.

23

HON. EUNICE LEE:

Because to me, the

24

Jevic case is distinct from what's going on here.

25

In that situation, you actually have something in

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 70
1

the bankruptcy code that specifically says this

2

is the priority order and it applies to certain

3

circumstances.

4

applying -- their basically, the bankruptcy court

5

is saying, well, we know these are the standard

6

priority orders, but because the code doesn't say

7

we have to apply it to a structured dismissal, we

8

won't.

9

And yes, in that case, they're

That's a clear inconsistency where the

10

code is addressing a particular area in a very

11

specific way about priority and the Court is

12

actually -- the bankruptcy court is saying, well

13

we know this is a priority, but we're going to

14

divert from this because we think there's a good

15

reason, something general like that.

16

there's not some specific provisions about third-

17

party releases in the code where you can look at

18

that, oh, this is some specific standard and

19

we're going to go away from that.

20

Here,

That's -- it seems like a different

21

situation in Jevic because it's highly specific.

22

And so yes, what they were doing wasn't forbidden

23

by the code, but it was addressed in a very

24

explicit way.

25

MR. SHIH:

212-267-6868

So, point taken Your Honor.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 71
1

We disagree with that reading of Jevic because,

2

you know, as the other side would have it, there

3

does need to be some express prohibition.

4

Your Honor's, I think, point is, I guess slightly

5

different which is, you know, that the sort of

6

inconsistency was more specific because there

7

we're only talking about, you know, the specific

8

priorities framework and here the inconsistency

9

is much broader, but that makes the problem

10

But

worse, Your Honor, not better.

11

So virtually every provision of the

12

bankruptcy code is there to restructure the

13

creditor-debtor relationship.

14

bankruptcy code really talks about.

15

Court has held and the Supreme Court has held and

16

other circuits have held that the whole point of

17

bankruptcy is tailored to that relationship.

18

so it makes sense that the code is replete with

19

statutory provisions directed to that

20

relationship.

21

That's all the
And this

And

It's not just the priority scheme that

22

we're talking about now.

23

about, you know, as the other side said, the warp

24

and weft of the entire bankruptcy code.

25

of those provisions, except one has anything to

212-267-6868

We're now talking

Veritext Legal Solutions

And none

516-608-2400

Page 72
1

say about the release of a non-Debtor's direct

2

claim against another non-Debtor.

3

provision is arising only in the asbestos

4

context, and it doesn't apply to direct claims.

5

It only applies to derivative claims, as this

6

Court explained in Manville IV.

7

The one

So the inconsistency is, yes, you're

8

right, Your Honor, it's a more general

9

inconsistency, but that just underscores why the

10

power asserted by the bankruptcy court was so

11

remarkable and why --

12

HON. EUNICE LEE:

I guess another way

13

to look at it is, if it's so general, how are you

14

determining that there is in fact an

15

inconsistency?

16

MR. SHIH:

So it's not -- it's a

17

structural analysis, Your Honor, in the same way

18

that the Supreme Court has relied on the similar

19

structural intuition in Jevic, RadLAX, and Law.

20

So, you know, again, the Supreme Court says,

21

where we have a whole bunch of provisions that

22

address a particular type of thing and no

23

provision addresses the sort of thing that the

24

bankruptcy court wants to do but there's

25

obviously a relationship between them, then, you

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 73
1

know, that is antithetical to the structure of

2

the bankruptcy code.

3

And so that intuition applies with full

4

force here, but it's not just a specific problem.

5

HON. JON NEWMAN:

So your reading of

6

1123(b)(6) when it says, any -- not inconsistent

7

with any active provision, you think that means

8

inconsistent with another provision that deals

9

with a specific topic and inconsistent with any

10

provision that doesn't deal with a specific

11

topic.

Is that right?

12

MR. SHIH:

13

that appropriate has meaning.

14

is that the specific topic relevant to the

15

question of a non-Debtor release is indeed the

16

topic of whether a discharge in bankruptcy can

17

provide relief not only to the Debtor but also to

18

the non-Debtor and not only for derivative

19

claims, but also for direct claims.

20

disagree with the premise of the question that

21

there is somehow some divergence between, you

22

know, that fundament of the bankruptcy code and

23

somehow that's irrelevant to the power that the

24

bankruptcy court has asserted.

25

No, Your Honor.

We agree

What we're saying

And so we

But it's not just these general

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 74
1

provisions, Your Honor, that the release offends.

2

The release also grants the equivalent of a

3

discharge to the Sacklers without ensuring that

4

the Sacklers submit to the code's procedures for

5

protecting creditors.

6

dispute, for example, that if the Sacklers had

7

declared bankruptcy themselves -- they haven't,

8

but if they had, the result would have been much

9

different and the deal would have looked quite

10

So there's no reasonable

different.

11

So the Sacklers would have --

12

HON. JON NEWMAN:

Excuse me.

Didn't we

13

say in Manville I that a release was not a

14

discharge?

15

MR. SHIH:

That was certainly part of

16

Manville I, but Manville I doesn't sweep that far

17

for two reasons.

18

addressed derivative claims as the later cases in

19

the Manville line make clear.

20

that in Metromedia, this Court explained that

21

indeed, a third-party release could be the

22

equivalent of a discharge.

23

go back to the inconsistency, if the Sacklers had

24

declared bankruptcy themselves, they would have

25

needed to account for all of their assets.

212-267-6868

The first is, Manville I only

And the second is

But you know, just to

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

They

516-608-2400

Page 75
1

would have needed to put them in the bankruptcy

2

estate subject to certain exemptions.

3

They wouldn't have been able to obtain

4

relief for claims for fraud and certain other

5

forms of intentional misconduct.

6

HON. JON NEWMAN:

The other doesn't

7

doubt anything you just said.

8

MR. SHIH:

9

And --

No, they don't.

They don't.

They don't --

10

HON. JON NEWMAN:

If go into

11

bankruptcy, the bankruptcy laws apply to them has

12

a discharged creditor.

13

Their argument is, this is not a discharge.

14

you say in effect, it's a discharge, right?

15
16

MR. SHIH:

Yes, Your Honor.

And

But that

makes the problem worse.

17
18

They don't dispute that.

HON. JON NEWMAN:

It it's not a

discharge, is it?

19

MR. SHIH:

It is the same relief that a

20

discharge grants.

21

is not a magical term in bankruptcy.

22

discharge means is that there is a permanent

23

injunction on bringing a particular claim.

24

That's exactly what this release does.

25

release operates as a permanent injunction on

And that's exactly

what a discharge in bankruptcy does.

And so they

10

say it's, well, not technically a discharge in

11

bankruptcy.

12

just underscores why this is so weird to try to

13

say, is consistent with the bankruptcy code.

14

the relief they're given by the bankruptcy court

15

is identical to a discharge, but the bankruptcy

16

discharge provisions emphatically do not cover

17

the sort of relief that they got, that is a

18

tremendous assertion of power on behalf of the

19

bankruptcy court that you would think Congress

20

would have specified more clearly if it had

21

intended the bankruptcy court to wield such

22

authority.

23

That's true, Your Honors, but that

If

And of course, notwithstanding the

24

asbestos exception, which applies only to

25

derivative claims we are not aware of and the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 77
1

other side hasn't cited a single example of

2

Congress saying that in something like the 222

3

years in which Congress has been legislating in

4

the bankruptcy space.

5

to the point about the relief that the Sacklers

6

could have gotten in individual bankruptcy just

7

illustrates why this case is on all fours with

8

Jevic and RadLAX and Law.

9

But, you know, to return

By not declaring bankruptcy, the

10

Sacklers didn't have to give up all of their

11

assets, got broader relief, release for claims

12

for fraud than they would have gotten under

13

bankruptcy, all under the umbra of bankruptcy.

14

And that's the sort of assertion of authority by

15

the bankruptcy court that evades specific

16

restrictions on what a discharge could do that

17

the Supreme Court found so problematic.

18

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Where in the

19

language of the release, you find they're

20

released from fraud?

21

MR. SHIH:

Sorry?

22

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Where in the

23

language of the release do you find they're

24

released from fraud, fraudulent claims?

25

MR. SHIH:

212-267-6868

So it's found in the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 78
1

definition of cause of action, Your Honor.

2

if you bear with me --

3
4

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

And

I just want to

make a note.

5

MR. SHIH:

Yeah, if you'll bear with

6

me, let me find it in our brief.

7

begin discussing this on Page 19 of our brief --

8
9

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Yeah, so we

Page 19.

Yeah.

Okay.

10

MR. SHIH:

And it continues on -- when

11

we discuss the changes to the release on Pages

12

222 -- 21 through 23.

13

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Okay.

14

MR. SHIH: And so the operative

15

definition of cause of action is any claim within

16

the meaning of the bankruptcy code, as well as

17

any claim of any kind, character, or nature

18

whatsoever.

19

encompass a claim for fraud against the Sacklers.

And that to me seems broad enough to

20

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

21

MR. SHIH:

All right.

So the other inconsistency

22

to point out is with respect to 524(g) itself.

23

When Congress enacted 524(g), it specified that

24

that was being enacted notwithstanding Section

25

524(e), which of course states that a discharge

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 79
1

in bankruptcy is for the benefit of the Debtor.

2

The other side has no explanation for

3

why Congress would have wanted to include the

4

notwithstanding language.

5

concerned, Congress didn't need to enact that

6

language at all, and indeed Congress, wouldn't

7

have needed to enact 524(g) at all, because in

8

their view, bankruptcy courts have traditionally

9

wielded such power, but --

10

HON. EUNICE LEE:

As far as they're

What do we -- I mean

11

with regard to 524(g), when it explicitly states,

12

don't read into, don't assume or read anything

13

into -- from this rather, about the bankruptcy

14

court's authority, it seems like it's a wash.

15

Like, how can you say, well, even though the

16

statute has an explicit provision telling --

17

saying, you can't rely on this or read into this,

18

we should still read into it.

19

MR. SHIH:

So it's not -- because that

20

over reads the rule of construction, Your Honor.

21

All the rule of construction says is, if Courts

22

believe that bankruptcy courts have always had

23

this authority, then the enactment of 524(g)

24

shouldn't restrict that.

25

best reading of the rule of construction, but

212-267-6868

That, I think, is the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 80
1

Congress didn't take a view as to -- in the rule

2

of construction as to whether bankruptcy courts

3

have traditionally wielded that authority.

4

And although the other side relies on

5

cases such as Katz that talk about the bankruptcy

6

court's traditional authority at the time of the

7

framing, they have notably failed to identify any

8

framing era example of a bankruptcy court

9

reaching out to terminate a non-Debtor's direct

10

claim against another non-Debtor and we're not

11

aware of any example of such historical power

12

being exercised under equity, which is another

13

reason why if a bankruptcy court is to exercise

14

that power, one would expect Congress to have

15

spoken quite clearly.

16

Metromedia itself recognized, there is no express

17

provision of the bankruptcy code authorizing the

18

release in question.

19

And of course, as

I --

HON. JON NEWMAN:

So is it fair to say

20

that with respect to non-asbestos claims,

21

Congress didn't speak one way or the other with

22

respect to releases?

23

MR. SHIH:

24

HON. JON NEWMAN:

25

MR. SHIH:

212-267-6868

That's fair, Your Honor.
Okay.

It's difficult to parse

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 81
1

because again, Congress in 524(g) said that

2

524(e) is a bar.

3

credit what Congress said insofar as Congress

4

relied on the notwithstanding language.

5

Congress hadn't thought of 524(e) as a bar, it's

6

hard to understand why Congress would have put in

7

the notwithstanding term.

8

Your Honor is right, that the bankruptcy code has

9

nothing to say, the District Court correctly held

And so, you know, we should

If

But, you know, even if

10

that the tie goes against the bankruptcy court's

11

exercise of authority here, and that's true for

12

two reasons.

13

The first is of course the rule of

14

construction that the Supreme Court articulated

15

in cases like Cowpasture, that requires an

16

exceptionally clear statement of congressional

17

intent.

18

Supreme Court said to the extent that the

19

bankruptcy court wants to assert a power that is

20

inconsistent with the structure, purposes, or

21

text of the bankruptcy code, there needs to be

22

much more than congressional silence.

23

fact that --

24
25

And second, the fact that in Jevic, the

HON. EUNICE LEE:

So the

Isn't that -- that's

the whole issue though, whether or not in fact

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 82
1

this is inconsistent with the bankruptcy code and

2

we know that there's no explicit provisions

3

addressing that.

4

here.

5

That's the whole sort of issue

MR. SHIH:

So Your Honor, if you don't

6

think that there's any inconsistency with the

7

bankruptcy code, then of course, this difficulty

8

is -- that's going to be hard for us to overcome.

9

HON. EUNICE LEE:

Right, but I mean, I

10

guess what I'm saying is, point me to the thing

11

that shows there's an inconsistency.

12

MR. SHIH:

If you haven't agreed that

13

the inconsistencies that we've identified here

14

are not inconsistencies, right, then Your Honor

15

has a very specific understanding of

16

inconsistency that just can't be squared with how

17

that is used in normal parlance because

18

inconsistency doesn't mean inconsistent with just

19

the express terms of a statute.

20

Imagine a plain language example,

21

library says members can only borrow books for

22

two weeks, and that's all.

23

nonmember marches in and says, well I'm not a

24

member so I can borrow books for as long as I

25

want.

212-267-6868

And then so a

I think everybody would go, that's a
Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 83
1

little bit weird, notwithstanding the fact that

2

the rule for the library doesn't have anything to

3

do with what nonmembers can or can't do.

4

that's analogous to the sort of inconsistency

5

that's present here where a non-Debtor says, I

6

can get the benefit of a discharge and the

7

bankruptcy gets to grant me the equivalent of a

8

discharge, a permanent injunction, as Judge

9

Wesley has pointed out, but I don't need to

And so

10

comply with any of the rules of the bankruptcy

11

code and I don't need to contribute all of my

12

assets, and by the way, the permanent injunction

13

that I'm getting is broader than the permanent

14

injunction, I would have been entitled to had I

15

declared bankruptcy myself.

16

That's the fundamental inconsistency

17

here and the fact that it's not just with limited

18

provisions such as the priority scheme makes the

19

problem worse and not better, Your Honor.

20

so, you know, to the extent --

21

HON. JON NEWMAN:

And

Is it your position

22

that there cannot be a lawful release of the sort

23

in this case unless Congress explicitly

24

authorizes such a release?

25

MR. SHIH:

212-267-6868

Yes.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 84
1

HON. JON NEWMAN:

2

MR. SHIH:

That's your position?

Our position is that if

3

Congress has not expressly authorized the release

4

of a direct claim of a non-Debtor against another

5

non-Debtor, then a bankruptcy court lacks

6

authority to adopt a plan that contains a release

7

of that sort, an expressed congressional

8

enactment, such as 524(g) except applicable to

9

direct claims and not just derivative claims.

10

That's the sort of thing that would be required

11

before a bankruptcy court or any court could

12

exercise authority in bankruptcy to do something

13

like that.

And the due process --

HON. JON NEWMAN:

MR. SHIH:

No, Your Honor, I did not

7

MR. SHIH:

I'm

What in your view

So I'm glad for the

8

opportunity to address that, Your Honor, and I

9

want to make something very, very clear.

The

10

U.S. Trustee fully recognizes the pain and

11

suffering that the opioid crisis has caused and

12

the U.S. Trustee agrees with the District Court

13

that the proposed plan with these contours could

14

provide a lot of things that are very good to a

15

lot of people.

16

legal question which is whether the release is

17

constitutionally sound or statutorily authorized.

18

But those don't bear on the core

And moreover, these predictions about

19

what will happen if the District Court is

20

affirmed are speculative.

21

bankruptcy court approved the plan based in

22

significant part on representations that it was

23

the best plan and based on, it seems, significant

24

efforts by the mediators to extract the best plan

25

and that led to a $4.3 billion contribution by

212-267-6868

So for example, the

Veritext Legal Solutions

the Sacklers.

2

But once the District Court vacated the

3

plan, the Sacklers agreed to contribute an

4

additional, like, one point something billion

5

more, which was not on the table until the plan

6

was vacated.

7

everything is going to fall apart are a little

8

hard to credit.

9

to take their proverbial ball and go home, that

So these suggestions that

But even if the Sacklers decide

10

doesn't mean that no plan can be confirmed.

11

for example, the estate has billions of dollars

12

in fraudulent conveyance claims against the

13

Sacklers that presumably the estate could pursue

14

if it chose.

15

So

The states and plaintiffs could recover

16

from the various lawsuits against the Sacklers

17

that the bankruptcy court put on ice and more

18

people could file lawsuits such as, presumably,

19

the Canadian municipalities whose ability to file

20

lawsuits has been pretermitted by the injunction

21

that the bankruptcy court put in place and to the

22

extent that --

23
24

HON. JON NEWMAN:

Where would they sue

the Sacklers?

25

MR. SHIH:

212-267-6868

I don't know, Your Honor.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

You'll have to ask the Canadians about that.

the point is, to the extent that the Sacklers

protest --

HON. JON NEWMAN:

But

is in the bailiwick of Jersey.

6

MR. SHIH:

That's right, Your Honor.

7

But these representations about the value of the

8

claims are also a little bit hard to credit.

9

at the confirmation hearing, the Debtor

So

is on Page 806 of the SPA where they said, we

15

chose the train that we're riding and train we're

16

riding is not the merits.

17

I think one illustrative statement

At the bankruptcy hearing, they never

18

analyzed the value of the claims.

19

retained any experts to value the claims.

20

didn't invite or receive any presentations from

21

potential plaintiffs with such claims.

22

hard now to say, well, you know, the claims are

essentially worthless.

how successful the Sacklers have been, as Your

Honor has said, at shielding their assets from

2

with the Sacklers' own behavior where they agreed

3

to pay a billion dollars more to get these

4

releases after the release was vacated, to try to

5

make this lawsuit go away.

6

But that's also difficult to square

So it's difficult to understand how, in

7

light of the absence of anything in the record

8

about the value of these direct claims against

9

the Sacklers and in light of the Sacklers'

10

willingness to pay an extra billion dollars just

11

to get the release to try to make the lawsuit go

12

away, that the fact that some of their assets may

13

make the Sacklers hard to collect against, makes

14

the claims that the non-Debtors have against the

15

Sacklers worthless.

was going to say, but your view is that that

doesn't really -- even if the Sacklers were

putting in 10 billion, your view is still that

these releases are bad and the deal can't go

through?

but I understood Judge Newman's question to be

2

focusing on the equitable components of this and

3

the sole point --

4

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

The claims --

5

what claims against the Sacklers could be

6

released and only the claims held by the estate?

7

MR. SHIH:

So the claims that are not -

8

- the releases that are not at issue here, Your

9

Honor, are the derivative releases, so releases

10

of the sort that were approved in Manville I such

11

as against the proceeds of an insurance policy

12

that was basically property of the estate.

13

Trustee has not contested the propriety of that

14

sort of release and, you know, we don't

15

understand any of the objectors to be focused on

16

that either.

17

The

So that would certainly still survive

18

an affirmance of the District Court's holding.

19

But the sort of thing that can't be released is

20

exactly the sort of claim --

21

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

Indemnification

22

claims they might hold against the against the

23

Debtors, should they themselves as corporate

24

directors be cast in the liability where they

25

have the right to indemnification?

MR. SHIH:

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

3

Who is bringing -The Sacklers.

Could the -- could they be released from that?

4

MR. SHIH:

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

I

5

think the way we would think about it is whether,

6

you know, that is a claim belonging to the

7

estate.

8
9

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

One of the

problems with this is that it seems like a

10

hypothetical.

11

That's why it was -- when the victims' council

12

stood up, it was helpful in some ways to put, you

13

know, some definition to it.

14

there's one injury.

15

exactly what -- that's MacArthur.

16

MacArthur because there was exposure to asbestos

17

by a product that MacArthur sold that Manville

18

made.

19

There's no definition to this.

And his view was,

I understand that.

That's

That's exactly

So it was all contained within that and

20

that's why that, recognizing the importance of

21

the insurance policy or the insurance coverage

22

and Judge Newman analogized to claims against a

23

common res -- for which could -- people could

24

make.

25

hard to see the -- it's hard to conceptualize how

212-267-6868

That makes perfect sense to me.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

But it's

516-608-2400

Page 91
1

this plays out as inappropriate beyond the

2

bankruptcy court's authority without putting the

3

actors together because they're so fact specific

4

in some times, and that's why I've continued to

5

ask questions about the state direct claims.

6

MR. SHIH:

Yes, Your Honor.

7

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

And asked your

8

Canadian colleague there, representing the

9

Canadian claimants to expound to that.

So, I

10

mean, these are claims that you premise exist,

11

but have -- no one's definitely asserted because

12

of the injunction, right?

13

MR. SHIH:

No, Your Honor.

So there's

14

two sort of sets of claims that could be fit into

15

an answer to you.

16

claims that already existed brought by a lot of

17

the states, for example, that were put on ice,

18

but had survived motions to --

19

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

The first are, all of the

20

practices, fraud --

21

MR. SHIH:

Right.

Unfair business

State, False Claims

22

Act cases or something along those -- so those

23

all survived motions to dismiss, as I understand

24

it, on the basis that they were actually

25

derivative claims and not direct claims, and our

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 92
1

brief sets out a couple of instances of cases

2

surviving motions to dismiss on that basis under

3

state law.

4

would be erased permanently by the release that

5

would be able to go forward under the District

6

Court's order if that's affirmed.

7

So that's one category of claims that

Another category, of course is claims

8

that haven't been brought in virtue of the

9

injunction that has been in place and to the

10

extent that they likewise assert direct liability

11

on behalf of the Sacklers, then those two would

12

be permanently extinguished, but individuals

13

would be able to proceed on them to the extent

14

that the District Court is affirmed.

15

But, you know, to your point that

16

there's essentially one injury, that's

17

potentially true as a factual matter in some of

18

these cases, but the fact is, we just don't know

19

because as Your Honor has pointed out, that is a

20

necessarily fact-specific inquiry and the point

21

of the release is that it pretermits any such

22

inquiry.

23

test whether their claims are sufficiently

24

overlapping.

25

Nobody gets to go to Court to try to

And Your Honor, even if the claims were

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 93
1

sufficiently overlapping, that wouldn't solve the

2

constitutional problem because, you know, as Your

3

Honor is quite aware, it's just a fundamental

4

principle of tort law that even though you may

5

suffer one wrong at the hands of multiple actors,

6

you have an individual claim, an individual cause

7

of action against all of the actors who have

8

injured you and it's that cause of action, that

9

property right under Zimmerman Brush, which is

10

being permanently terminated by the Sackler

11

release and that's something that there must be a

12

clear statement from Congress before a bankruptcy

13

court can assert that authority.

14

And I want to close by underscoring the

15

importance of that constitutional question, which

16

didn't get a lot of air time in the presentation

17

of the other side.

18
19

HON. EUNICE LEE:

Could I just -- I'm

sorry to jump in.

20

MR. SHIH:

Of course.

21

HON. EUNICE LEE:

Yeah.

It's related to this,

22

the constitutional question.

23

wondering how the constitutional problem you see

24

here in terms of extinguishment of property

25

rights and claims, how does that not also apply

212-267-6868

I guess I'm

to 524(g)?

2

Is that unconstitutional?
MR. SHIH:

No, Your Honor, and that's

3

true for two reasons.

4

enacted 524(g) and when --

5

HON. EUNICE LEE:

6

The first is. Congress

Well, Congress can't

go against the Constitution.

7

MR. SHIH:

That's right, Your Honor,

8

but as the Supreme Court and other cases have

9

held, Congress' rearrangement of the economic

10

relationship between actors is subject to

11

rational basis review, but the reason that's true

12

is because the Constitution vests authority in

13

Congress, and Congress alone to make decisions

14

about how to balance the countervailing policy

15

interests and the heightened procedures in

16

524(g), which by the way were not followed here,

17

only underscore the extent to which Congress took

18

seriously those constitutional concerns.

19

Here, Congress has not acted and so for

20

the bankruptcy court to assert the authority to

21

just copy/paste provisions that might be

22

constitutional in the limited context of

23

derivative claims in asbestos bankruptcies and

24

say, well, we think that these provisions are

25

good enough in this context for direct claims in

1

non-asbestos bankruptcies, that's a key

2

separation of powers problem and nobody in this

3

case has cited any authority for the bankruptcy

4

court to craft remedies that is, you know, a

5

power traditionally allocated by the Constitution

6

to Congress and Congress alone.

interpreted Metromedia?

7

MR. SHIH:

Judge Drain

8

said Metromedia adopted factors that a judge must

9

find for a release to be approved.

We disagree

10

with that reading of Metromedia, but to the

11

extent that this Court agrees with Judge Drain

12

that Metromedia controls, those findings are

13

clearly erroneous for the reasons we set forth in

14

our brief.

15

Drain's findings with respect to the

16

constitutional issues.

17

Moreover, we disagree with Judge

Judge Drain found, for example, that

18

notice was sufficient but for the reasons set

19

forth in our brief, the fact that the notice may

20

have gone out to a lot of people does not mean

21

that the quality of notice was sufficient to put

those people on notice of what this plan was

going to do.

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, we just heard

8

a great many things from the U.S. government that

9

are extremely surprising, to say the least.

I

10

think most importantly, a lot of the argument you

11

just heard assumes that 34 years of Second

12

Circuit precedent is either illegal or

13

unconstitutional and that the majority of

14

circuits in this country have been violating both

15

the law and the Constitution for decades, none of

16

which is true.

Judge Wesley, to answer your first

question, why was 524(g) needed?

5

HON. RICHARD WESLEY:

MR. HUEBNER:

3

to Jevic and Energy Resources.

was that the structured dismissal there, which

5

was a permanent final disposition of the Debtor's

7

conduct of the code violated the code's "first

that clearly counsel was unaware of, is that

Judge Drain found as a matter of fact that more

discovery was provided in this case than any case

14

he has seen in his, I think he said, 34 years as

15

a lawyer and judge, and more than the Sacklers

16

would have provided had they been in Chapter 11.

Another fact that he appears not to know is that

the majority of the Sacklers' wealth is not in

strangely enough in Judge McMahon's prior

cases and comes out the other way on every single

issue from her decision here.

exact fact pattern in Kirwan and Karta and

Answer, not within the ambit of the

conduct and it's not a legally relevant cause.

11

Your Honor, just a couple of finer

12

points, because the U.S. -- the Trustee said so

13

many things that are troubling.

14

response to your question about the rule of

15

construction, I'm not sure where the gloss on the

16

rule of construction came from but it is totally

17

clear on its face that it forbids exactly the

524(g) analysis.

Judge Lee, in

answer under the statute, but the rule of

people and the destruction of a plan that every

3

creditor in this case worked for years to build

to ensure a lifesaving outcome.

5

Your Honor, just one final thing if I

6

may.

We also heard some testimony about the fact

7

that he doesn't believe or is not sure that the

8

claims are intertwined.

9

already found that to be untrue.

Not one but two judges
Judge McMahon's

10

prior decision in Dunaway which was about the

decision below on appeal expressly found the

17

that the claims were intertwined and inseparable.

And so the Debtor's conduct is always

at the core.

The Debtor's very reorganization is

Judge Newman asked counsel, what

but the clients of everyone else in this

The answer was an appellate

gamble that an alternative that two estate

fiduciaries and 11 groups spent years exploring

25

every pathway because they think it sort of might

The notion that we should

because they have some generic cases that say

insult to 34 years of Second Circuit precedent as

16

discrete point that Judge Lee had raised, which I

17

think went to the question of what the Sacklers'

18

role was at Purdue at the time that these

19

releases and contributions were negotiated,

20

because it would be troubling if a party got to

be on both sides of that transaction and in fact

determine their own fate.
