Rachel Green: Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Chandler Bing: I know! I know!
Rachel Green: Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Chandler Bing: Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Rachel Green: Really?
Chandler Bing: Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
