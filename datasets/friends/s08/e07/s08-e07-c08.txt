Rachel Green: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Rachel Green: How was the game?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.
Rachel Green: Oh.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
Joey Tribbiani: I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
Rachel Green: Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
Joey Tribbiani: No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?
Rachel Green: Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
Joey Tribbiani: I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
Rachel Green: Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
Joey Tribbiani: I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
Rachel Green: I know.
Joey Tribbiani: Y'know I blame Ross for this.
Rachel Green: I do too a little bit.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
