Ross Geller: Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Phoebe Buffay: Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Monica Geller: Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Chandler Bing: I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Monica Geller: Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Phoebe Buffay: So what's going on with you?
Ross Geller: Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Phoebe Buffay: Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: How long has it been since you had sex?
Ross Geller: Well, last weekend...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh that's not so bad.
Ross Geller: ...will be two months...
Phoebe Buffay: That is.
Ross Geller: ...since I stopped trying.
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Ross Geller: What-what do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Ross Geller: Oh.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Ross Geller: Wow!
Phoebe Buffay: Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Ross Geller: Okay, I think I got it.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
