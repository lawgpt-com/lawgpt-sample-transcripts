Phoebe Buffay: So, you're like a zillionaire?
Chandler Bing: And you're our age. You're our age.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Peter Becker: What like Pete Dakota?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Chandler Bing: That's not a state Joe.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Peter Becker: I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
#ALL#: Okay.
Chandler Bing: You're our age!
Peter Becker: So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Monica Geller: Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, kinda.
