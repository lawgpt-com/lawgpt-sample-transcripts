Ross Geller: My God!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Ross Geller: Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh he knows! For the most part.

Kyle: Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Whitney: We kinda need to talk.
Phoebe Buffay: Both of you together?
Ross Geller: Wh-what's up?
Whitney: Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Kyle: ...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Ross Geller: Oh just say it Kyle!
Kyle: We're gonna give it another try.
Phoebe Buffay: What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Whitney: I'm gonna work on that.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Ross Geller: Y'know, he hums when he pees!
Whitney: I do know.
Ross Geller: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Whitney: We're so sorry.
Ross Geller: That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Kyle: Yeah, we're gonna go.
Ross Geller: I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Ross Geller: Yeah, were better off without them.
Phoebe Buffay: And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Ross Geller: Divorced men's club.
Phoebe Buffay: Potato, Potaato.
