Chandler Bing: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Joey Tribbiani: He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.

Chandler Bing: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Ross Geller: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Chandler Bing: Then what?
Ross Geller: My first time with Carol was...
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Ross Geller: It was my first time.
Joey Tribbiani: With Carol? Oh.
Chandler Bing: So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
