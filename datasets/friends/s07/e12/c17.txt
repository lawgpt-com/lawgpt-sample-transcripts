Rachel Green: Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Tag Jones: Still no luck.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Tag Jones: Do you want me to check again?
Rachel Green: Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Tag Jones: Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Rachel Green: Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Tag Jones: Any luck?
Rachel Green: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Tag Jones: Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Rachel Green: You put these on my desk!
Tag Jones: I did not!
Rachel Green: Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
Tag Jones: How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Rachel Green: I am so hot for you right now.
