David: Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Phoebe Buffay: Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
David: July. Umm,
Phoebe Buffay: That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
David: Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Phoebe Buffay: That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
David: Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Phoebe Buffay: You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
David: I-I do though.
Phoebe Buffay: I do too.
David: Bye Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Joey Tribbiani: No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Phoebe Buffay: No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Joey Tribbiani: Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Phoebe Buffay: Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Joey Tribbiani: I can give it a shot.
