Health Inspector: Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Monica Geller: Oh, Larry.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Larry: No, bribes.

Phoebe Buffay: It's okay to laugh right?
Larry: Yeah, I was just kidding.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Larry: I'll check the kitchen floors.
Monica Geller: Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
unknown: nan
Phoebe Buffay: Yum-my!
Monica Geller: Larry?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Larry: A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Monica Geller: Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Larry: And where is your hat?
Monica Geller: It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
unknown: nan
Larry: Ahh that's the 2 points.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Larry: Oh, I don't know about that.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Larry: Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Larry: I-I'll call ya.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
unknown: nan
Phoebe Buffay: He's so funny!
