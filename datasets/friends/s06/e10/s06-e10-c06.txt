Chandler Bing: I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Rachel Green: Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.

Chandler Bing: Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!

Chandler Bing: Those are book ends! That's a great gift!

Rachel Green: Ha!
Chandler Bing: Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Rachel Green: Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
