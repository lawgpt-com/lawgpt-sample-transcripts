Monica Geller: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
Phoebe Buffay: I hope it's you.
Rachel Green: Me too!
Monica Geller: First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Rachel Green: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Monica Geller: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Phoebe Buffay: Yes!!! Oh!!
Rachel Green: Hypothetically!
Phoebe Buffay: Still.
Monica Geller: If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Rachel Green: Uh-hmm.
Monica Geller: Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Rachel Green: Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Monica Geller: Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Phoebe Buffay: Wh-why is that the best part?
Monica Geller: Because then I don't have to!
Rachel Green: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Monica Geller: I'm really not deciding!
Rachel Green: Fine!
