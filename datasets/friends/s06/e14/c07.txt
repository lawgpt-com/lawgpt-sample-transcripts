Monica Geller: Hey sweetie!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Chandler Bing: There's no back to this couch!
Monica Geller: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Chandler Bing: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Monica Geller: Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Chandler Bing: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica Geller: Stop it!
Chandler Bing: No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Monica Geller: I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Chandler Bing: Yeah?
Monica Geller: Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Chandler Bing: Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Monica Geller: And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Chandler Bing: Aww, I love you so...
Monica Geller: What is wrong with you?!!!
Chandler Bing: What?!
Monica Geller: What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Chandler Bing: So you didn't mean any of that?!
Monica Geller: No you robot!!
