Joey Tribbiani: Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Joey Tribbiani: Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, I look good.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Joey Tribbiani: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
