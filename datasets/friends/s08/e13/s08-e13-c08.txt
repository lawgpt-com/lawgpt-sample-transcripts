Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey. Well, what's up?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, Joey, I know.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Phoebe Buffay: I knooow.
Joey Tribbiani: Whaaat?
Phoebe Buffay: I know about your feelings.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God. You do?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
Joey Tribbiani: I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
Phoebe Buffay: For God sakes, it's Rachel!
Joey Tribbiani: I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
Joey Tribbiani: What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Phoebe Buffay: Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
Joey Tribbiani: You think?
Phoebe Buffay: Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
Phoebe Buffay: That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
Joey Tribbiani: Not really.
Phoebe Buffay: Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
