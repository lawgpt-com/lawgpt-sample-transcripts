Rachel Green: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Rachel Green: Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Chandler Bing: Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Rachel Green: I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Chandler Bing: Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Rachel Green: What?
Chandler Bing: All yours babe.
Monica Geller: Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.

Monica Geller: Really?!
Rachel Green: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Monica Geller: Yes, we are.
Rachel Green: And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
