Monica Geller: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Phoebe Buffay: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

Monica Geller: Hey! I didn't know either.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Monica Geller: Yeah, I knew.
