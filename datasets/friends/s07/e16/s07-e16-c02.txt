Monica Geller: What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Chandler Bing: You mean the spitter?
Monica Geller: Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Chandler Bing: Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Monica Geller: All right, what about the third guy?
Chandler Bing: You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Monica Geller: Can you blame him?
Chandler Bing: Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Monica Geller: Well then we still have a problem.
Chandler Bing: Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay: With what?
Monica Geller: Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.

Phoebe Buffay: Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Monica Geller: Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Phoebe Buffay: No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Monica Geller: Are you serious?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Joey Tribbiani: I call it!!
Phoebe Buffay: What?! No! It was my idea!
Chandler Bing: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Joey Tribbiani: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Chandler Bing: We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
