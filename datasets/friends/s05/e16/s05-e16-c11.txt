Monica Geller: Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Joey Tribbiani: Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Rachel Green: What?! Why?!
Joey Tribbiani: Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Monica Geller: What about the closeness?
Joey Tribbiani: Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
