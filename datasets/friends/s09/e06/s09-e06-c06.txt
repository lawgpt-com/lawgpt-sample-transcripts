Chandler Bing: Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
Monica Geller: Heeeeeey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Chandler Bing: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Monica Geller: Was your cabin pressurised?
Chandler Bing: And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Chandler Bing: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Monica Geller: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, he came up...
Monica Geller: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
Chandler Bing: Were you there?
Phoebe Buffay: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
