Ross Geller: Hey!
Charlie Wheeler: Hey!
Ross Geller: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Charlie Wheeler: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
Ross Geller: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Charlie Wheeler: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Ross Geller: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
Charlie Wheeler: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Ross Geller: Yeah. Why?
Charlie Wheeler: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Ross Geller: Your ex-boyfriend?
Charlie Wheeler: Yeah.
Ross Geller: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Charlie Wheeler: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
Ross Geller: Well, if you think it would help.
Charlie Wheeler: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
Ross Geller: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Charlie Wheeler: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Ross Geller: We'll see how dinner goes.
