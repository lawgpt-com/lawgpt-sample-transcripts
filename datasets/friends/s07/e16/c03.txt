Rachel Green: Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
Ben Geller: But you're not anymore!
Rachel Green: No, I'm not.
Ben Geller: 'Cause you guys were on a break.
Rachel Green: Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Ben Geller: When's my daddy coming back?
Rachel Green: Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Ben Geller: Sharing is good.
Rachel Green: Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Ben Geller: Really? Like how?
Rachel Green: Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Ben Geller: That's a good one.
Rachel Green: Yeah? You like that one?
Ben Geller: Yeah, you're funny.
Rachel Green: I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Ben Geller: Can I do it to you?
Rachel Green: Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
