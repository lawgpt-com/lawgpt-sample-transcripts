Chandler Bing: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Joey Tribbiani: That's the rule.
Chandler Bing: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Joey Tribbiani: How'd you get to that?
Chandler Bing: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Joey Tribbiani: You knew about that?
Chandler Bing: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Joey Tribbiani: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Chandler Bing: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah
Chandler Bing: You think we're ready for something like that?
Joey Tribbiani: Why not?
Chandler Bing: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Joey Tribbiani: Why, are you moving out?
Chandler Bing: I'm not moving out.
Joey Tribbiani: You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Chandler Bing: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Joey Tribbiani: Aw, I know all about Kip!
Chandler Bing: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Chandler Bing: Aw, don't do that
