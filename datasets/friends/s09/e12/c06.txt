Ross Geller: Whazzup??
Chandler Bing: Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Ross Geller: Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Chandler Bing: You don't trust him?
Ross Geller: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Chandler Bing: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Ross Geller: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
Chandler Bing: Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Ross Geller: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
Chandler Bing: Picturing that tree?
Ross Geller: I am, yes.
