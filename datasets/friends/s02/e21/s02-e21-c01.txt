Joey Tribbiani: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Monica Geller: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Rachel Green: Ok honey, you really need a job.
Ross Geller: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Monica Geller: Really.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Ross Geller: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Phoebe Buffay: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
#ALL#: Ahh.
Phoebe Buffay: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Monica Geller: His indian name?
Phoebe Buffay: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Ross Geller: Freakish.
Monica Geller: Wow.
Joey Tribbiani: Freaky.
Monica Geller: Weird, weird.
Rachel Green: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Monica Geller: Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
