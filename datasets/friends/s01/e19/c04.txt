Chandler Bing: I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Joey Tribbiani: I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Chandler Bing: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Ross Geller: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Joey Tribbiani: She really said that?
Ross Geller: Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Joey Tribbiani: 'Tonight' tonight?
Ross Geller: Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Chandler Bing: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ross Geller: Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Chandler Bing: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
