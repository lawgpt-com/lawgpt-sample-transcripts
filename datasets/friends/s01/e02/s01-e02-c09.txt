Barry Farber: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Rachel Green: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Barry Farber: Oh, that's great.
Rachel Green: Why are- why are you so tanned?
Barry Farber: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Rachel Green: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Barry Farber: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Robbie: Me?!
Barry Farber: No! I went with Mindy.
Rachel Green: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Barry Farber: Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Rachel Green: Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Barry Farber: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Rachel Green: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Barry Farber: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Rachel Green: Okay..
Barry Farber: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Rachel Green: Wow.
Barry Farber: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Rachel Green: What?
Robbie: Me.
Rachel Green: Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Barry Farber: Well, thank you for giving it back.
unknown: nan
Robbie: Hello?!
