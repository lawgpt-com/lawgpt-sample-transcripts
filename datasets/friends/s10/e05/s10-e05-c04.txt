Rachel Green: God!
Amy Green: So beautiful.
Rachel Green: Oh, I know, isn't she?
Amy Green: No, I was talking about your bedding.
Rachel Green: All right. What's your news, Amy?
Amy Green: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Rachel Green: What? Oh my God! To who?
Amy Green: This guy! He has a killer apartment.
Rachel Green: A-And??
Amy Green: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
Rachel Green: No, what's he like?
Amy Green: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Amy Green: It's his dad.
Rachel Green: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Amy Green: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Rachel Green: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
Amy Green: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
Rachel Green: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
Amy Green: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
Rachel Green: Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
Amy Green: You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!
Rachel Green: Ok.
Amy Green: I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
Rachel Green: Ok, let's keep talking.
