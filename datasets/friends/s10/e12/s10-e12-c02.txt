Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
Monica Geller: Well, it matters to me!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Monica Geller: Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Monica Geller: You don't know military time?
Phoebe Buffay: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Monica Geller: Just subtract twelve.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Monica Geller: Six o'clock!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok.
Monica Geller: Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Phoebe Buffay: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Monica Geller: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Phoebe Buffay: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica Geller: Ooh... she backed out.
Phoebe Buffay: She did? Why?
Monica Geller: I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
