Monica Geller: Hello?
Ross Geller: Hi.
Rachel Green: Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Monica Geller: Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Ross Geller: Look, can, can you do something for me?
Monica Geller: Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Radio: The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Radio: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
