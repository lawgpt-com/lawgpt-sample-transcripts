Ross Geller: I'm sorry.
Rachel Green: Does it?
Ross Geller: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Rachel Green: What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Ross Geller: No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
