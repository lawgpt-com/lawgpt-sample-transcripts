Joey Tribbiani: Morning. Here you go.
Ross Geller: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Ross Geller: So you took off my pants and shoes?
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
Ross Geller: What do you mean?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Ross Geller: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Joey Tribbiani: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Ross Geller: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
Joey Tribbiani: That's what I hear, yeah.
Ross Geller: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Joey Tribbiani: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Ross Geller: Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm crazy about her.
Ross Geller: And she feels the same way?
Joey Tribbiani: I think so.
Ross Geller: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
Ross Geller: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
Ross Geller: Yeah, I'm sure.
Joey Tribbiani: And we're okay?
