Phoebe Buffay: Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
Rachel Green: Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Phoebe Buffay: I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?
Rachel Green: Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Rachel Green: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Phoebe Buffay: Eye-contact?
Rachel Green: Mm-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay: I hope you were using protection.
Waiter: Excuse me. Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
Rachel Green: Oh. Should we send them something back?
Phoebe Buffay: Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.
Rachel Green: No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Phoebe Buffay: So? What if they do?
Rachel Green: Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
