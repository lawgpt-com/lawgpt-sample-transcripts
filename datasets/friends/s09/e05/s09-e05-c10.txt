Rachel Green: Och, god. Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
Ross Geller: Great. So let's get going?
Rachel Green: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
Judy Geller: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: "Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you."
Ross Geller: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
