P R O C E E D I N G S

THE COURT:

Okay.

Good morning.

This is Judge

3

Drain.

4

hearing on the Debtors' request of confirmation in the In re

5

Purdue Pharma, LP, cases of their Chapter 11 plan, we're

6

taking the matters scheduled for the regular monthly Purdue

7

omnibus cases -- I'm sorry, the omnibus agenda for those

8

cases.

9

As we discussed on Friday, before we resume with the

I have the agenda for that hearing, and I'm happy

10

to go down it in order.

11

matters on the agenda are uncontested.

12

confirmation from the Debtor's counsel that it still remains

13

the case with regard to the interim fee applications, the

14

late claim motion by Mr. Ellis, the late claim motion by Mr.

15

Higgins, the late claim aspect of the motion by Mr. Evans,

16

and the late claim motion by Mr. Jackson.

17

MR. HUEBNER:

I will note that the first few
I just want to have

Yes, Your Honor; good morning.

For

18

the record, Marshall Huebner of DavisPolk for the Debtors.

19

Your Honor, can I be heard and seen clearly?

20

THE COURT:

Yes.

21

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

Yeah.

And just a small

22

procedural note on the side, I know that the audio has not

23

been perfect at all times.

24

and sending emails and texts asking people to please get

25

closer to the mic.

212-267-6868

And so we've been asking people

I'm actually using headphones today,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 32
1

which hopefully will be helpful, so that the public is

2

aware, you know, the Debtors and the Court, frankly, have

3

gone to all the lengths that were made possible to them to

4

have access be as broad as possible.

5

With respect to this morning, before pro-se

6

motions that are uncontested reflect that philosophy, you

7

know, wherever we can frankly just agree when people are

8

facing very difficult life situations where it's

9

appropriate, we have accommodated.

We also ask the Court

10

despite the great number of people listening not to move the

11

remaining two pro-se motions that are contested because we

12

are well aware how incredibly difficult it is for many pro-

13

se movants, especially those who are incarcerated, to have

14

hearing dates changed on them.

15

So we appreciate everybody's patience and,

16

obviously, the Court's obviously cooperate as well in

17

letting those proceed.

18

are agreed reductions with the fee examiner reflected in an

19

omnibus form of agreed order.

20

uncontested except for the two, which Mr. McClammy is

21

handling.

22

So the short answer is, yes, there

Everything remains

And before the Court came on, I think one of our

23

two pro-se claimants is already on the sort-of CCTB I think

24

waiting to join.

25

from me, I think those five orders can simply be entered

212-267-6868

So unless the Court has further questions

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 33
1

without taking up any further cost or time of the general

2

public, and we can actually turn the podium over to Mr.

3

McClammy to handle the two and then get directly back into

4

the confirmation hearing.

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Well, I have

6

revised the motions which are all filed by people who are

7

incarcerated for authority to file a late proof of claim.

8

The Debtors have agreed to that relief after consultation

9

with key parties in interest, including the Unsecured

10

Creditors' Committee.

11

motions requests for leave to file a late proof of claim.

12

And I will grant each of those

I have also reviewed the interim fee applications

13

and the proposed order which reflects agreed reductions

14

after consultation with the fee examiner.

15

each of those applications on an interim basis.

16

So those orders will be entered, as well.

17

And I will grant

That leaves two contested matters that are on the

18

agenda, and the first one involves a different request by

19

Mr. Evans, who I see on the screen, for the appointment of

20

counsel for him in this bankruptcy case.

21

request as well as the Debtors' objection to it.

22

So, Mr. Evans, I see you there.

I've reviewed that

Do you have

23

anything further to say in support of your request to be

24

appointed a pro bono counsel?

25

Oh, I think you're on mute, sir.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

If you can

516-608-2400

Page 34

unmute yourself.

Can we unmute him?

3

CLERK:

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

6

MR. EVANS:

Sound check one two.

7

THE COURT:

Yes, I can hear you now.

8

MR. EVANS:

Okay.

10

THE COURT:

Good morning.

11

MR. EVANS:

My issues are I'm not understanding as

5

9

(Indiscernible).
We can't unmute him from here?

Okay.

Thank you.

Good morning, Your

Honor.

12

much.

Are my claims being considered timely for the voting

13

purposes or from this minute forth my claim is considered to

14

be timely?

15
16

THE COURT:

Right.

Okay.

Why don't I ask the

Debtors' counsel to confirm the answer to that.

17

MR. McCLAMMY:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe

18

they'll be treated and with the order will be treated timely

19

for both the purposes of voting and we've made efforts to

20

also send the voting package out to Mr. Evans and will be

21

considered timely for purposes of the trust distribution

22

procedures should the plan be approved.

23

All rights have been reserved with respect to the

24

merits of the claim, but the timeliness issue has been taken

25

off the table.

Page 35

THE COURT:

Okay.

So that was Mr. McClammy who

2

represents the Debtors in this case.

So the answer to your

3

question, Mr. Evans, is that your claim will be treated as

4

timely for both --

5

MR. EVANS:

Okay.

6

THE COURT:

-- voting and claim purposes.

7

MR. EVANS:

Okay.

Because I was communicating

8

with an attorney and she said there was an issue that needed

9

to be resolved.

So I have been putting forth an effort

10

myself to try to communicate with lawyers, but it's hard for

11

me to get on the phone and communicate with these people and

12

write them and get a timely response.

13

So this is why I'm asking the Court to recruit

14

counsel for me because this bankruptcy stuff, this stuff is

15

like very, very complicated.

16

that I'm still trying to understand things.

17

incarcerated, the obstacles that are put before me are just

18

like -- they're overbearing.

I mean I got stacks of papers
And being

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

20

MR. EVANS:

So --

21

THE COURT:

Well, you now do have the answer to

22

that question, which is that your claim will be treated as

23

timely.

24

MR. EVANS:

Right.

25

THE COURT:

And then let me address the other

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 36

aspect of your request which is to have a pro-bono lawyer

2

appointed for you.

3

talking to an attorney.

you?

5

You stated just now that you've been
Has that person agreed to represent

MR. EVANS:

No.

7

THE COURT:

Okay.

8

MR. EVANS:

Mr., I think it's, Arik Preis.

9

THE COURT:

Right.

10

MR. EVANS:

And Arik Preis gave me a reference to

6

It came from the Creditors'

Committee.

11

a lawyer in Texas and -- but this is also confusing because

12

she said the case would have to be filed under Texas law.

13

And I know at this point for me to -- for them to file the

14

case under Texas law, she must have just came into the law

15

firm or something because it doesn't make sense --

16

THE COURT:

Right.

17

MR. EVANS:

-- because it went this far, why would

18

we go -- so I have issues --

19
20

THE COURT:
a case.

I understand.

Because it really isn't

It's a claim in a bankruptcy case --

21

MR. EVANS:

Right.

22

THE COURT:

-- as opposed to a separate

23

litigation.

24

MR. EVANS:

Right.

25

THE COURT:

There are attorneys who have

Page 37

represented people in this case, like yourself, who are

2

incarcerated.

3

In fact, I see one on the screen, Mr. Ozment.

But let me explain sort of the context here which

4

is important.

And I appreciate you're not a lawyer.

There

5

are well over 100,000 people, individuals who have filed

6

claims in these cases.

7

MR. EVANS:

Right.

11

THE COURT:

The plan that's before the Court, the

12

Chapter 11 plan, proposes setting up a trust with a

13

dedicated amount of money, between $700 million and $750

14

million, which would go along with the expenses of the trust

15

to pay allowed personal injury claims like yourself that you

16

filed.

17

MR. EVANS:

Right.

18

THE COURT:

But part of the plan and the trust

19

structure contemplates a procedure to determine whether

20

those claims would be allowed.

21

MR. EVANS:

22

THE COURT:

Right.
And that procedure has not yet gone

23

into effect because the Debtors' request for approval of the

24

plan is still pending before me.

25

MR. EVANS:

212-267-6868

Right.

THE COURT:

So when that procedure -- if the plan

2

is confirmed, when that procedure goes into place, you will

3

receive forms as to whether you elect to have what's called

4

the fast claims procedure or, instead, elect to go through a

5

trial to establish your claim.

6

MR. EVANS:

7

THE COURT:

Understood.
It may at that point you would want to

8

have a lawyer.

At this point, the interests of all of the

9

personal injury claimants as well as all the other unsecured

10

creditors are represented by the Official Committee of

11

Unsecured Creditors --

12

MR. EVANS:

Understood.

13

THE COURT:

-- which is a broad group of people

14

represented by Mr. Preis who contacted you who are looking

15

out for all the unsecured creditors.

16

MR. EVANS:

Understood.

17

THE COURT:

And in addition, there are, again, a

18

lot of the people who filed claims represented by counsel

19

who have also been looking out for not only, in effect,

20

everyone because their clients at this stage of the case are

21

personal-injury claimants like all the other personal-injury

22

claimants so they were negotiating with other types of

23

creditors like the state and local governments as to the

24

allocation of value.

25

MR. EVANS:

212-267-6868

Right.

THE COURT:

So I will give you my ruling in a

2

second, but I want you to understand that at this point in

3

the case, and this is going to be consistent with my ruling,

4

you would not fall into the very limited set of

5

circumstances where someone would really need a lawyer to be

6

appointed for them --

7

MR. EVANS:

Understood.

8

THE COURT:

-- in this type of case.

9

It may be

that lawyers now that they see you might reach out to you to

10

have you be represented, but the law that deals with the

11

appointment of counsel for someone really doesn't call for

12

the appointment of counsel for you at this point given the

13

status of the case.

14
15

MR. EVANS:

That's understood, sir.

And most of

what you have said to me I fully understand.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

17

MR. EVANS:

So it's not a lose-lose situation.

18

But it would help me out a lot if I did have an attorney.

19

But I guess if it's denied, I can get to that stage where if

20

no one has taken my case by then, I just refile a motion for

21

appointment of counsel if I'm denied.

22

THE COURT:

That's right.

You could do that then.

23

And there are -- if I confirm the plan, there will be an

24

administrator of the trust and you can reach out to them.

25

And that's described to a fairly large extent in the plan,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 40

but you can get an explanation of how that works from the

2

lawyer for the Creditors' Committee.

3

MR. EVANS:

Right.

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

5

MR. JOSEPH:

Your Honor, permit me for one second

just it may be helpful for Mr. Evans and frankly others who

are similarly situated.

9

Mr. Evans, just so you know -- and, Judge,
obviously, please stop me if you don't like it, it won't

10

take very long -- the voting on the plan has concluded.

But

11

because over 120,000 people have voted, your vote frankly,

12

it does not affect your distribution.

13

whether you vote yes or whether you vote no or whether you

14

choose not to vote or whether you don't get a ballot in time

15

has no effect on whether you are able to recover under the

16

plan and get sort of money out of the trust being set up.

17

So I just don't want you to think that because,

In other words,

18

you know, you may have missed the voting deadline that that

19

will affect your economic recovery.

20

issue, and I just wanted to make sure that you and others

21

who may be in the same situation of just not having gotten

22

their ballots understand that that's not likely to change

23

your economic recovery.

24
25

MR. EVANS:

Actually, if I may, actually I got my

ballots and all of that.

That's a different

All of that's good.

my opinion, it's (indiscernible) a good plan.

3

I still think I have to continue to reach out to lawyers

4

because this bankruptcy stuff is like, wow, it's confusing

5

to me.

But, however,

It's confusing.

THE COURT:

MR. JOSEPH:

THE COURT:

No, I understand that.

morning your request to have your claim be treated as a

12

might want to get a lawyer.

13

MR. EVANS:

That's going to be easy.

14

THE COURT:

Okay.

You know, you

So I'm just going to cover this

15

very briefly, sir, because I think we've gone through it.

16

But the other request that you made in your motion beyond

17

the request which I've already granted which is to deem your

claim timely --

MR. EVANS:

-- is that you have a lawyer appointed

3

rare.

4

MR. EVANS:

Understood.

5

THE COURT:

The courts have really limited that.

6

In fact, there's even some question whether bankruptcy

7

courts have the power to appoint counsel in a civil case,

8

and all bankruptcy cases are really civil cases.

9

MR. EVANS:

(Indiscernible).

10

THE COURT:

So that's laid out in a pretty

11

thorough opinion from one of the courts in my circuit, In re

24
25

First, the person has to make a threshold

And that's a

And then there's the second requirement which is a
balancing of a lot of factors.

But they include: the

2

someone's being sued as opposed to in your case having a

claim; whether conflicting evidence implicating the need for

cross-examination will be the major proof presented at any

5

trial; and the complexity of the legal issues and any

6

special reason why appointment of counsel would be more

Now here, again, none of those claims is

I mean one of the aspects of the claim procedures

17

under the trust setup for personal-injury claimants under

18

the plan that's proposed and before me for consideration is

19

pretty simple streamlined procedures to submit a claim.

20

MR. EVANS:

Right.

21

THE COURT:

So you may not need a lawyer for that.

22

Even though overall, bankruptcy is completed and you've got

23

this lengthy document, the disclosure statement which lays

24

out a lot of issues in this overall bankruptcy case,

determination of the merits of your claim may be pretty

So --

MR. EVANS:

But the evidence --

THE COURT:

So at that point but not before then,

I don't see any need for you to have a lawyer, frankly.

to be appointed for you.

the interests of all unsecured creditors.

MR. EVANS:

willing to take on your claim at some point in the case.

24

You can reach out to them about that.

really is under the law that I've just gone through, it's

But at this point, it

the right to be informed, the right to consumer education,

the right to be heard, and the right to seek redress.

All we will say,

516-608-2400

Page 51
1

similar to Your Honor's reaction, is we're clearly very

2

sympathetic to Ms. Morales' situation and, indeed, all that

3

have suffered loss in the opioids crisis.

4

And then, you know, obviously faced with the many

5

unique individual claims here, and understanding that the

6

Bankruptcy Code is meant to provide a collective process for

7

addressing those claims and the Debtors having put forth a

8

plan that they believe is in, you know, the best interest of

9

all creditors and the American public more generally, to

10

help abate the opioid crisis, we will rely on our papers,

11

Your Honor.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

So, Ms. Morales, I want to be

13

clear in distinguishing between your claim in the case and

14

the context in which it's raised at this point in the case.

15

Those are really two different things.

16

There are about 140,000 people who have filed

17

claims on behalf of themselves or a family member against

18

the Debtors.

19

of those claims have not yet been determined on a claim-by-

20

claim basis.

21

of bankruptcy law that you don't decide the merits of one

22

claim and provide for its payment before you have a plan

23

that provides how all of those claims will be dealt with.

24

Otherwise, someone would get a leg up on the rest because

25

they --

212-267-6868

That's a lot of claims, obviously.

The merits

And generally, there's a very strong principle

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 52
1

MS. MORALES:

2

THE COURT:

Right.
-- would have their claim determined

3

first.

4

support of a lot of different parties in the case, including

5

the Unsecured Creditors' Committee, which represents the

6

interests of all creditors including yourself, and lawyers

7

who represent lots of those 140,000 people, states,

8

governmental entities and other types of claimants, is a

9

plan that allocates in the aggregate basis money to pay

10

So what the Debtors have proposed here with the

claims.

11

So under the plan that's before me, I haven't

12

confirmed it.

It's on -- the hearings are on for

13

confirmation.

700 to 750 million dollars are allocated to

14

cover personal-injury claims like the one you have filed.

15

But it would be premature to decide your claim now and to

16

have a payment now as opposed to under a plan that deals

17

with all of those claims in an organized way so that people

18

get treated the same who have similar claims.

19

The plan that is up for approval at this point, as

20

I've discussed in the matter that came up just before you,

21

sets up a trust where claims like yours will have the right

22

to seek redress, seek payment.

23

MS. MORALES:

24

THE COURT:

25

I guess -Let me just finish because I'm just

going to another point that I think is important to you --

MS. MORALES:

2

THE COURT:

Okay.
-- at least based on what I've read.

3

There are two ways to seek recovery from that trust if I

4

approve the plan.

5

procedures or, you know, more simple procedures where you

6

submit certain information as a claimant that's specified in

7

a notice.

8

on, you know, categories that apply across the board to

9

people whether you would be entitled to a payment based on

10

One is called the so-called streamline

And the trust administrators will determine based

the information provided.

11

The other way to submit -- to proceed to have

12

redress for your claim would be to ask for a trial and in a

13

regular, you know, in a court, a court of law.

14

away from your pleadings that you actually want to know as

15

determined perhaps by a court of law what actually caused

16

your father's death and whether Purdue is responsible in

17

some way for that.

18

court determine that issue as opposed to a trust

19

administrator.

20

And I take

So there is that option to you to have a

But under either scenario, those things happen

21

under a plan where all of the creditors like yourself, all

22

the roughly 140,000 people, have the right to proceed with

23

those two approaches and get paid their pro-rata share.

24

it's really against a major principle of bankruptcy law that

25

that happen early for just one person like yourself as

212-267-6868

And

516-608-2400

Page 54

opposed to under procedures like that.

2

MS. MORALES:

3

THE COURT:

Okay.
So my determination is to deny your

4

motion to seek payment and a determination now but not on

5

the merits of your claim.

6

MS. MORALES:

7

THE COURT:

The merits of your claim survive.

Okay.
And you would be able to seek that

8

relief assuming that this plan is confirmed under the plan,

9

under the two alternative mechanisms that I explained, or if

10

the plan's not confirmed, in some other way but again in a

11

way that has comparable treatment for you and the other

12

140,000 or so people who have filed claims like you.

13

So this is just a procedural ruling.

It doesn't

14

go to the merits of your claim.

15

will be addressed, but it's too early to address it at this

16

point.

17

MS. MORALES:

Okay.

The merits of your claim

And I guess that's just where

18

I didn't see in the plan.

19

overdose and it wasn't just an overdose.

20

of four medications that should not have been like ever

21

interact -- like they interacted.

22

been taken together.

23

so broad, I just didn't think that it would cover

24

specifically like a situation like mine where it wasn't --

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

It's just -- there's just for
It was an overdose

They should have never

And I guess it's just because that was

MS. MORALES:

2

confused or -- yeah.

3

THE COURT:

Yeah, I guess that's where it was

If he had a prescription for OxyContin

4

and that contributed to his death, then I believe it would

5

be covered by --

6
7

MS. MORALES:

separate one for failure to warn because when he took --

8
9

THE COURT:

MS. MORALES:

11

THE COURT:

Those claims are

Okay.
-- within the basic fact pattern that

I just went through that someone had a prescription --

13

MS. MORALES:

14

THE COURT:

15

Let me clear.

subsumed within --

10

12

Well, there's no -- would there be a

Okay.
-- for OxyContin and it contributed to

their death or personal injury.

16

MS. MORALES:

So it doesn't matter that it's a

17

little bit different because serotonin syndrome's pretty

18

rare.

It's I guess --

19

THE COURT:

20

MS. MORALES:

21

THE COURT:

22

MS. MORALES:

23

THE COURT:

24

I don't think so.

I don't believe so.

No?
I don't believe so.
Okay.

Okay.

So I mean one would still have to show

that that prescription led to your father's death.

25

MS. MORALES:

212-267-6868

But --

It's -- okay.

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 56

2

THE COURT:

you might well be able to show that.

3

MS. MORALES:

4

THE COURT:

5

On the other hand --

Okay.
-- the Court may determine that it

didn't.

6

MS. MORALES:

7

THE COURT:

8

-- under the facts as you've alleged,

Okay.
But those are the issues that will be

decided --

9

MS. MORALES:

10

THE COURT:

Okay.
-- either under the plan or if I don't

11

confirm the plan in some other mechanism as well as all the

12

other claims by the personal-injury claimants like yourself.

13

MS. MORALES:

14

THE COURT:

15

MS. MORALES:

16

THE COURT:

Okay.
Okay.

So I hate to say --

So I just had one question.
I hate to say this, but -- and this is

17

not particularly fair, but I think you need to be -- you

18

need to wait a bit until there's a mechanism to determine --

19
20

MS. MORALES:

Oh, okay.

I'm not trying to be fair

-- I'm not trying to be unfair to any other claimants.

21

THE COURT:

22

MS. MORALES:

I understand.
If they voted and gave up their

23

rights, they have the right to do so.

24

didn't, if they objected, they have their rights to do so.

25

So I was just -- you know, my thing is rare.

212-267-6868

If they voted and

Page 57
1

syndrome is rare.

There was no warning at the time about

2

taking antidepressants with Oxycontin until six years later.

3

THE COURT:

4

MS. MORALES:

Right.
I mean so I just thought mine was --

5

I didn't think because I don't think that there's going to

6

be like too many claimants similar to mine.

7

wasn't sure if there was a category for mine because it's a

8

little bit -- I don't know how you guys like -- I don't know

9

how it's going to be -- because I mean overdose is kind of

10

broad, and I didn't know if it was going to go deeper into

11

different like issues and like -- of how it's classified, I

12

guess.

13

THE COURT:

So I just

The plan -- the current plan, the plan

14

before me, contemplates tiers of potential liability but

15

also gives people like yourself the opportunity to have a

16

determination by a court.

17

into account the individual facts.

18

MS. MORALES:

So I believe that it does take

Yeah, the facts.

And so the merits,

19

like as long as like -- I guess I'm still -- it's not going

20

to affect my claim either -- it's not going to -- by you

21

denying this or approving, it's not going to --

22

THE COURT:

23

MS. MORALES:

24

THE COURT:

25

MS. MORALES:

212-267-6868

No.

It doesn't affect --

Okay.
-- the merits of your claim at all.
So in summary judgment, so usually

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 58
1

that works like it's usually granted when you could prove

2

the undisputed facts of --

3

THE COURT:

4

MS. MORALES:

5

THE COURT:

6

Let me be clear, Ms. Morales.

I'm denying your motion not on the

merits.

7

MS. MORALES:

8

THE COURT:

9
10

Oh, okay.
So you won't be bound by this order as

far as your underlying claim is concerned.

I'm denying it

because it's premature in seeking the relief.

11

MS. MORALES:

12

THE COURT:

13

MS. MORALES:

14

Okay.

Oh, okay.
Okay?
Okay.

I see that, okay.

I

understand.

15

THE COURT:

And that will be put in the order.

16

That will be clearly stated in the order.

17

Purdue or a trust can't waive the order at you without that

18

Paragraph being there which protects you on that point.

19

MS. MORALES:

20

THE COURT:

21

MS. MORALES:

22

THE COURT:

Oh, okay.

So someone from

Okay.

Okay?
Thank you.

All right.

So I'm going to ask the Debtors to

23

submit that order.

24

when this case gets to the point of liquidating, that is

25

deciding the merits of the underlying claims, you may want

212-267-6868

Like the person who was on before you,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 59
1

to reach out to a lawyer.

2

MS. MORALES:

3

THE COURT:

Okay.
That's up to you.

But at this point,

4

it's just premature to decide the underlying merits of your

5

claim.

6
7

MS. MORALES:

Is there still discovery because --

8
9

Is there still discovery going on?

THE COURT:

Well, the trust makes it easier to

take discovery because there's a document -- I'm trying to

10

use a non-lawyer word.

There's a place where there's a lot

11

of documents that are available.

12

MS. MORALES:

13

THE COURT:

But --

Okay.
-- there is -- particularly if you

14

follow the court route, you have, you know, time to take

15

discovery.

16
17

MS. MORALES:

it still ongoing because I don't --

18
19

THE COURT:

No, for individual claimants, you can

take discovery.

20

MS. MORALES:

21

THE COURT:

22

MS. MORALES:

23

THE COURT:

24

So is discovery -- is it over or is

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Yeah.
All right.
But, again, it's premature to do that

until you're in the claim liquidation process.

25

MS. MORALES:

212-267-6868

Oh, okay.

And I was just -- to my

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 60
1

understanding, it was just after discovery that like -- that

2

a moving party can file for that.

3

that I can't do that yet.

4

THE COURT:

5

MS. MORALES:

6

THE COURT:

So now it's understood

Not yet; that's right.
Not yet, okay.
And, again, if I confirm the plan, the

7

trust has two different paths that you can take.

8

where there's not a lot of time spent with lawyers and

9

discovery and the like.

It's a faster path.

One is one

But you can

10

choose to take the other path which is a trial path.

11

it's really there to give people two different options.

12

MS. MORALES:

13

THE COURT:

14

MS. MORALES:

15

THE COURT:

16

Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.

So I'll look for that order,

Mr. McClammy.

17
18

And

MR. McCLAMMY:

Yes, Your Honor.

We'll take care

of that.

19

THE COURT:

20

concludes the omnibus hearing.

21

hearing on the Debtors' request for confirmation of their

22

amended Chapter 11 plan.

23
24

All right.

And I think that then
And we will get back to the

Mr. Evans, you're not a party to that hearing so
you could sign off.

You have a great day, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

Okay.

2

MR. EVANS:

And thank you.

3

MR. McCLAMMY:

4

Thank you.

And, Your Honor, just one

housekeeping matter before we start with witnesses.

5

THE COURT:

Sure.

6

MR. McCLAMMY:

We were informed by counsel for

7

West Virginia that Dr. Cohen who's on the witness schedule

8

at number ten for today.

9

he will not be available today.

Due to unforeseen circumstances,
We understand he will be

10

available starting tomorrow, and if he were to go tomorrow,

11

we would propose after having discussions with counsel, just

12

let him in after Mr. Bickford testifies tomorrow.

13

THE COURT:

Okay.

14

MR. McCLAMMY:

We've informed other counsel on the

15

case this morning and have not heard anything to the

16

contrary.

17

THE COURT:

18

MAN 1:

19

THE COURT:

All right.

Very well.

Your Honor?
Let me just confirm on this point, I

20

think I have this right, Mr. Cohen I believe was the one who

21

was not originally on the witness list and then West

22

Virginia asked to have him added or was that someone else?

23
24

MR. McCLAMMY:

I believe he's been on the list,

Your Honor.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Mr. Cahn, you had made a request to

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 62
1

add some one to the list?

2
3

MR. CAHN:

Was it Mr. Cohen?

Mr. Cohen -- can you hear me, Your

Honor?

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. CAHN:

Yes.
All right.

Dr. Cohen was always on the

6

witness list.

We didn't have his declaration filed by the

7

deadline, so we filed it out of time.

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. CAHN:

10

Fine.
But he's always been on the list.

THE COURT:

So no one is objecting to him

11

testifying, right, given that -- the statement that he's

12

been on my list for a while now, correct?

13

take --

14

MR. McCLAMMY:

15

THE COURT:

16

MR. McCLAMMY:

17

THE COURT:

18

We'll just

That's correct.

We'll just take -That's correct.

Okay.

Very well.

Thank you, Mr.

Cahn.

19

MR. CAHN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. EDMUNDS:

Okay.
Your Honor, Brian Edmunds for the

22

State of Maryland.

23

that we would bring to the Court's attention now so that we

24

can understand how to proceed.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

There's one other housekeeping matter

Okay.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 63
1

MR. EDMUNDS:

As the Court knows, David Sackler is

2

scheduled to provide his direct testimony as a witness for

3

the Side B Family.

4

We had been discussing with the Side B Family and the

5

Debtors whether we would also call him as our witness as

6

he's on our witness list today for his convenience to make

7

it easier for him to testify at once.

8
9

I think he's the third witness today.

We've had a little bit of an issue arise with the
exhibits.

Your Honor entered the procedures order that

10

governs this case on August 10.

11

not inconsistent with the procedures order, we received

12

instructions from Debtors as to how to use -- how we could

13

use the screenshare to show exhibits to witnesses.

14

turns out that we had discussed with them and prepared with

15

them over the weekend to use that system today, and it turns

16

out that it's not available.

17

On August 11, in a manner

And it

So as Mr. Sackler is a witness that we would put

18

on our case and as this has come up I think through nobody's

19

fault, I just wanted to make clear and inform the Court and

20

ask the Court that we would be able to recall him tomorrow

21

or whenever the Debtors allow rather than have to shift

22

gears and sort of go through the other process with the

23

exhibits today, which I think would be quite -- we're trying

24

to do that as I'm speaking to the Court.

25

be quite a difficult shuffle to get in of somebody who may

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I think it would

516-608-2400

Page 64
1

testify in an hour from now.

2

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Let me ask you are

3

these exhibits -- Mr. Edmunds, are these exhibits already in

4

the joint exhibit book or are --

5

MR. EDMUNDS:

6

I think -- I believe that they are.

Yeah.

7

THE COURT:

Okay.

And have you given my clerks a

8

list of them so I have them at hand, I will have them

9

readily available?

10
11

MR. EDMUNDS:
that yet.

12

I do not believe that we have done

If not -THE COURT:

All right.

I would ask you to do that

13

because, you know, there are boxes of exhibits all over the

14

courtroom.

15

that's neither here nor there to your point which is that

16

you would like to be able to recall David Sackler as part of

17

your case.

And it really would be helpful to do that.

But

18

So is there any problem with that, Mr. Joseph?

19

MR. JOSEPH:

Your Honor, there's no reason why Mr.

20

Sackler should be testifying twice.

The virtual procedures

order is clear.

22

to use with him.

23

24

have him testify all at once today, then we would prefer to

25

do it just one time.

They had emailed us exhibits that they want
We've sent them and told him not to open

But I will say that if Your Honor is not going to

the week.

2

THE COURT:

That's fine.

I think that makes

3

sense.

4

limited declaration.

5

itself just goes to the importance of the releases.

6

aspect of his testimony I believe would be fairly short.

7

I'm happy to do it on a different day.

8
9

I mean I have read his declaration.

It's a very

It just goes to -- the declaration

MR. JOSEPH:

All right.

So that

The other thing I would

say, Your Honor, is over the weekend we understood from Mr.

10

Edmunds that he'd be cross-examining two to three hours

11

today.

12

schedule today if that doesn't happen.

13
14

I think there's going to be a large hole in the

THE COURT:

Well, I don't know if they're going to

have --

15

MR. JOSEPH:

16

THE COURT:

But whatever the Court wants.
-- two to three hours or that

17

declaration.

I think it's more likely that that would be

18

part of the testimony that he would have as a witness being

19

called by the objecting states.

20

MR. JOSEPH:

21

that, Your Honor.

22

later in the week.

There's no question about

And we'll just plan to have him come back
We'll schedule a time.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. EDMUNDS:

THE COURT:

So unless

there are any -- we just lost --

4

CLERK:

He is still on.

5

THE COURT:

Okay.

So unless there are any other

6

housekeeping matters, I think the first witness on for today

7

is Ms. Conroy, and I see her there.

8

Would you raise your right hand, please?

9

Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the

10

whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

some more substantive questions.

minute or two.

Good morning, Ms. Conroy.

I'm just going to go through

According to Paragraph 4 of your declaration, in

20

investigating the role of Purdue Pharma and members of the

21

Sackler Family and the fraudulent marketing and misbranding

22

of Oxycontin since 2002, is that correct?

23

A

That's correct.

24

Q

And initially, your investigation was in connection

25

with your representation of individual plaintiffs that had

516-608-2400

Page 68

sued Purdue Pharma over what you say was the fraudulent

2

marketing and misbranding of OxyContin?

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

And that investigation led to the filing of 1,000

5

complaints in New York Supreme Court Suffolk County?

6

that right?

7

A

8

were filed in Staten Island.

Not -- no, not Suffolk County.

Thank you.

Did you obtain discovery and take depositions of Purdue

14

Pharma executives in those lawsuits?

15

A

Yes, we did.

16

Q

And was that over the period of 2003 to 2006?

17

A

Yes.

18

Q

And would you characterize the volume of information

19

you obtained in those suits as substantial?

20

A

Absolutely, yes.

in those actions?

Ms. Conroy, in negotiating the settlements reached

10

and incorporated into the plan during these Chapter 11

material public creditors would be able to opt out and

13

pursue their own direct claims against the Sacklers outside

Could you just briefly tell the court what a peace

Are you familiar with the term "a peace

Yes.

Well, generally, what it talks about, and in particular

10

we see in large mass torts, asbestos litigation, things like

11

that, a piece premium is when you can reach a resolution

12

with a defendant that also brings closure or peace to that

defendant so that they know that the next day they will not

14

be sued in another jurisdiction for the same issues.

15

In this case in particular, that is very

important.

There's no premium that we can achieve in a

settlement with a defendant if there's another group waiting

Is that the basis for the objection?

This is not really my

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, I think Ms. Conroy

5

actually answered the question and Mr. Goldman moved on to

another one, which was whether Ms. Conroy was aware of any,

I guess, prepetition lawsuits that asserted a fraudulent

MR. GOLDMAN:

This is where I

If he must ask what she

THE COURT:

It was elicited in a very general

Ms. Conroy, you referenced, in response to Mr. Higgins'

12

complaints you're familiar with about something called

Project Tango?

A

15

epinephrin or something like that?

Q

Right, that's an opioid antagonist, correct?

it as opioid adjacent perhaps or something like that, but it

actually is a different type of product.

4

is you're aware that Purdue has an affiliate called Avrio

Q

Ms. Conroy, my name is Frank Ozment, and I represent

2

some individual claimants who were opioid use disorder

3

victims.

4

what was included within the definition of opioid product,

5

and there was some colloquy regarding buprenorphine.

6

your understanding of what is an opioid product for purposes

7

of these releases, is buprenorphine an opioid product or an

8

opioid?

9

A

You were asked about your understanding regarding

In

Well, it's not an -- it's -- I don't know the answer

10

with respect -- as I sit here right now, I don't know the

11

answer with respect to the releases.

12

not an opioid.

13

antagonist, but it also can be abused, and I'm aware of

14

Project Tango, but I don't know the answer to your question

15

with respect to the release.

16

Q

17

record, and I don't mean to quibble, but would it be

18

consistent with your recollection that buprenorphine is

19

actually an opioid agonist?

20

A

Yes.

21

Q

Okay.

22

you can't tell us whether these releases would preclude

23

litigation arising from allegations around buprenorphine,

24

right?

25

A

Okay.

It's certainly -- it's

In my mind, it's an opioid product.

It's an

And would you -- just so that we're clear on the

So bottom line is, as you're sitting here today,

Well, it -- I can't -- I mean, I'm not looking at a

release.

I don't have an opinion on that, and I -- so I

2

don't have an answer for you sitting here.

3

Q

4

buprenorphine is an opioid in the sense that that has been

5

used in the litigation that you pressed; is that right?

6

A

7

in litigation that we have pressed, and it's been part of

8

when we have sought ARCOS data and other data.

9

included as a drug that we have been interested in, in

And as you sit here today, you can't tell us whether

Well, it has been used in the litigation as an opioid

It has been

wanting to understand in the broader picture, you know, who

11

has distributed that drug and who has dispensed it.

12

am not -- I just -- as I sit here today, I'm not familiar

13

with where it sits with respect to the Purdue release.

14

Q

15

press any claims for improper marketing or other misconduct

16

or alleged misconduct on the part of Purdue that involved

17

buprenorphine; is that right?

18

A

19

that we looked at with respect to the marketing of

20

buprenorphine and how it was -- and how it would fit into

21

the general marketing scheme by Purdue, so we did look at

22

that.

23

Q

24

looked at it, but whether you actually filed a lawsuit

25

seeking recovery based on misconduct involving

Okay.

But I

And to be more specific, I mean, you didn't

THE COURT:

Well, it's -- I think that's probably

a little broad.

I don't think it's being asserted for the

just attached as a mailing.

Mr. Hurley can correct me, being offered as evidence of the

and ultimately, decided not to be on our Committee.

yes, that is fair that there are none on the Committee

I wanted to ask you, Mr. Atkinson, when the UCC was

question and stop.

14

about the amount, I'm just -- when the UCC was formed, there

15

was already a plan for the Sacklers to contribute billions

16

of dollars in support of this -- in -- during this

17

bankruptcy?

18

A

Yes, there was.

19

Q

And during those phase one, phase two negotiations,

there -- those negotiations never involved a scenario in

to this estate?

Does the UCC's position, or has the UCC's position on

Was it -- and was this

The first full paragraph above subsection 7, starts

with the words, to be clear.

A

Yes.

Q

When the UCC wrote this letter, they were -- they had

had an opportunity to meet with the defense presentations

from the Sackler's; is that correct?

7

A

Yes.

8

Q

And in spite of those defense presentations, the UCC

9

indicated it does not believe that the Sackler settlement

reflects the full value of claims against the Sacklers and

related parties; is that correct?

I think it in a -- in a vacuum, yes, that is correct.

There was collection
I think that there's --

there's other things that we think about, I think at the end

2

of the day, all of the, stage one of the mediation was tied

3

to -- to getting to a resolution that with the plan, what

4

the contribution and the loss of the phase one of mediation

5

we viewed as a massive risk to -- to any outcome that didn't

6

include a contribution from the Sacklers.

7

We also have factored in, you know, with out a

8

successful plan, the DOJ Snapback provision.

9

a lot of things I think went into play.

So, there were

But I think in a

10

vacuum, we, you know, we believe we have a good case, but

11

there's a lot of risks to that case.

12

Q

13

in way does the UCC support from this plan, condone the

14

actions of the Sacklers in their role as the Board of

15

Directors overseeing Purdue Pharma, from 2007 through 2018?

A

don't think we'll be doing anything (inaudible).

as this analysis of legal claims is concerned, he relied on

Q

13

when we filed the case in September 2015, after the UCC was

appointed, the UCC was, for many months of this case, in

The UCC believes, with conviction, that the terms

that funds are distributed promptly to begin to compensate

requirements imposed of an (inaudible) process, and a myriad

competing interests.

of it.

The last two sentences of the letter, right before

2

the italicised sentence, if you'd just read those to

3

yourself for a minute, I think that's probably better.

4

let me ask you a very simple question, which is, knowing

5

what you know now, including reading the objections and the

6

pleadings that were filed, since the June 3rd letter, and

7

since also your August 5th declaration, do you still believe

8

this concluding paragraph to represent the views of the

committee?

And

10

A

I -- I believe the committee views have not changed.

11

Q

Okay.

12

because Mr. O'Neill and I were actually agreeing about

13

something before, but it wasn't obvious, I can't help myself

14

as a document-based lawyer to -- to be a little fussy about

MR. HURLEY:

Objection, it's the UCC's letter, for

the record.

THE COURT:

Okay.

But I think the question,

7

though, is does -- did the UCC contemplate that under the

plan, there would be a provision, at least for some period,

9

abatement medicines or drugs produced by the debtors at cost

10

or free?

BY MR. OZMENT:

understand it, we were focused on getting money to --

14

specifically money to victims, and or public, you know,

public claimants, so that they could use the money as they

THE COURT:

I understand your

But so -- so Mr. Atkinson, is it fair

8

to say that in evaluating the plan and in support of the

plan, the committee, which supportive of all forms of

10

abatement, views any public health initiative of the post --

11

post confirmation of the entity that will be formed, to be

already factored into the settlement?

MR. ATKINSON:

16

into the settlement.

17

THE COURT:

That's fair.

We did not factor it

It would be on top of that to the

make the decision as to whether they thought it was in the

Do you know whether the individuals who are incarcerated in

I don't think

BY MR. OZMENT:

12

Q

13

just to make sure, was there anybody on the Committee, as

14

opposed to the Committee itself, who was having those kinds

15

of discussions with the United States regarding whether

16

opioid use disorder victims could have a lien under the

17

mandatory Victim Restitution Act?

Okay.

Maybe it's subject to a similar objection, but

I'll sustain that for the same reason.

Obviously, you don't know whether it's true or not, but just

6

based on what you heard, Mr. Atkinson.

And how that was described.
Yes.
Whether it was described usually in

nominal value terms instead of net present value terms?

MR. HURLEY:

That's exactly right.

21

THE COURT:

Much better put than my question.

Okay.

All right.

So, again, just

based on your knowledge of how people characterized the

value that they were discussing, not whether they believed

it or not, you can answer that question.

I

Mr. Atkinson, you've been

7

involved in, as you know, scores of Chapter 11 cases and I

8

think you have a pretty good idea of attorney-client

9

privilege and shared privilege.

So I don't want you to

10

disclose anything that would fall into either of those

11

categories when you answer those questions.

12
13

MR. TROOP:

And, Your Honor, I would raise two

others, mediation privilege in the context of the estate.

14

THE COURT:

Yes.

MR. TROOP:

And 408, generally.

MR. HURLEY:

THE COURT:

Your Honor -Well, the 408 doesn't really apply

into the details of this, but just whether there was such a

admission of Mr. Green’s expert report of July 6th?

13

Okay.

I have reviewed the report and I will admit it as

14

Mr. Green’s expert testimony with respect to the matters set

15

forth in the report, which primarily go to a response to a

rebuttal of Mr. DeRamus’ report on non-cash transfers by the

17

Debtors to the Sacklers indirectly through the IACs largely

18

with respect to royalty rates.

19

Does anyone want to cross-examine Mr. Green?

I don’t have any questions of him either, based on

MS. MONAGHAN:

Okay.
So then our next witness, Your

But because of the way the scheduling worked out, all

counsel agreed that Mr. Cain could be called today and Mr.

He is a rebuttal expert to Mr. Hrycay.

question, which is have you retained outside counsel in

Q

13

certain governmental and private plaintiffs have been named

as defendants, including, among others, the Side A former

directors?

Okay.

16
17

How did you become aware that since 1918,

MS. MONAGHAN:

And just for the record, I assume

you meant 2018, not 1918.

18

MR. GOLD:

I certainly did mean 2018.

Thank you

19

for correcting the record.

20

BY MR. GOLD:

A

The detail would have been provided by our lawyers.

Q

And by your lawyers you mean the lawyers who are also

the lawyers for the Side A Sackler defendants?

did you become aware of that particular fact?

4

A

Again, the detail was provided by Debevoise & Plimpton.

Q

And one more statement from there that there are

former directors.

Did you make any independent investigations to

How did you become aware of that?

10

determine these facts outside of information provided to you

by Debevoise & Plimpton?

12

A

No, I did not.

13

Q

Just to be clear, did you review any of the complaints

14

in those lawsuits?

15

A

I have seen various complaints over the years, yes.

16

Q

Okay.

17

you’ve seen some of the complaints that we’ve just been

18

describing?

19

A

A limited number,

yes.

20

Q

A limited number.

And do you have any way of knowing

21

from your personal knowledge whether that limited number is

22

in any way representative of the large number of complaints

23

you referenced?

A

No, I don’t.

Page 177

to Paragraph 23 on Page 12 -- that I understand, for

2

example, that one state alleged that the entire Sackler

3

family, together with entities for their benefit, engaged in

4

unlawful conduct through an entity the state termed the

5

“Sackler Pharmaceutical Enterprise”.

6

A

Yes.

7

Q

Which state made this allegation?

8

A

I’m afraid I can’t recall.

9

Q

Did you know at one time?

10

A

Yes, I did know at one time.

11

Q

Further, your declaration states that, quote, in the

12

same place, that one complaint named the daughter of a Side

B former director even though she never sat on Purdue’s

14

board and she worked in Purdue’s R&D group for a few months

more than a decade ago.

Against any Sackler Side A family members other than the

former directors?

Is that --

MR. GOLD:

That would be my generic way of

phrasing it, but I was really trying to -- that’s why I

phrased it in terms of beneficiaries of the trust listed on

position of the parties is that a business judgement was

THE WITNESS:

If I may, Your Honor.

I’m not sure

8

that Mr. Gold completely understands the position I was

taking.

Because I think that what the trustees for the A

10

family want to see is an end to all Purdue-related claims.

11

And those Purdue-related claims flow from the United States

12

but can affect many individuals and many businesses outside.

So it’s the -- to the extent there is an extraterritorial

impact of this, it flows from Purdue and everything that has

I’m sorry I can’t be more precise.

MR. GOLD:

Do I need to clarify that, Ms.

Monaghan?

13

MS. MONAGHAN:

Well, I just object to the form

14

because of the sort of mix and match of the time periods.

15

He describes the period of time he was discussing with the

16

independent directors starting all the way back in 2009.

17

The first allegations or the first complaints against any of

18

the shareholders were not until 2018, as Ms. Conroy

testified.

MR. GOLD:

That’s a good point and I appreciate

11

Q

You testified in Paragraph 24 of your declaration that

12

the Trustees of the Sackler family trusts have been

authorized by an order of the Royal Court of Jersey of

14

commit to paying trust assets only if they obtain releases

15

for the trusts, the trustees, the trust protectors, the

If the releases, as currently proposed, are not

be amended?

3

A

They could.

4

Q

I'm sorry, did you say they could or they ---

5

A

Yes, they could.

And so if the bankruptcy court were to refuse to

7

approve the releases and the trustees determine that would

8

be -- it would be in the best interest of the trust

9

beneficiaries to agree to releases with a narrower scope,

the trustees could go back to the Royal Court of Jersey and

So -- I'm sorry to be slightly longwinded, but to

21

answer your question, the trustees would need to decide

22

whether they are willing to proceed on the basis of a

23

settlement -- a different agreement or a different order

24

made by the bankruptcy court and thus far, I think it would

25

be very difficult for them to do so, because they have taken

they felt what was currently being proposed was right for

arguments before the court in order to get guidance.

confidential nature of the proceeding that was discussed

That's correct.

years ago, the family took advice from aw leading family

that a trust committee would be established, but that was

trustees and the beneficiaries continued as it had

save to the extent that there have been meetings between the

trustees and the family council, typically twice a year.

MS. MONAHAN:

Yes, there was.

judgment of the Royal Court on June 30th, 2017 in that

proceeding?

19

Yes, I am.

about the role of the family council in administering the

No, it does not.

the precise wording, but you might be thinking of a

2

beneficiary committee that -- the beneficiary committee was

3

referred to, but in a very limited capacity, and that

4

related only to determining issue.

5

with the administration of the trust itself, and neither the

6

family council nor the beneficiary committee has every

directed the trustees as to how they should exercise their

8

discretions.

9

Q

It had nothing to do

That's not exactly what I asked, but I will move on

10

from this point and just ask if you have ever seen the

Yes, I have.

And you're familiar with the subcommittees of the

So, the liaison and the interface between the trustees

individual family members, save for the meetings that I've

Page 223

stipulation, Mr. White, that was entered by this Court on

2

August 5th that provided for a modification of the otherwise

global releases as to U.S. Purdue entities, but in effect,

only as to Canadian claims, Canadian assets, and any

10

Your Honor, Marshall Huebner.

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Okay.

I might not have it in my

capacity to describe that stipulation.

13

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I guess my question, though, is

14

that if there is a modification to what otherwise you would

15

believe to be global releases, whether Mr. White believes

16

that he has go back before the court in Jersey to seek a

17

modification of the August 5th order that he has from there

I think the question is as follows.

Mr. White, if the release that's currently in the plan is

modified to make it more narrow, will the trustees have to

2

go to the Jersey Royal Court, no matter how that release is

3

changed, in order to get an amendment of the August 5 order

4

and approval of the release?

5

THE WITNESS:

Yes, Your Honor, and the -- this

6

order is quite clear and it is -- I think in the settlement

7

agreement or the plan -- forgive me, I can't remember which

8

-- that makes it clear that the final sanction of the Royal

9

Court is required to perfect this, so if and when this Court

10

confirms the plan, the trustees would go back to the Royal

11

Court in Jersey and would present the revised plan.

12

And to answer the particular question, it would be

13

incumbent on the trustees to explain developments and

14

explain any changes.

clear, if one or more of the parties have objected to the

perhaps my last one is, besides reflecting your belief, is

14

that belief relevant to the permission you need to get from

15

the Jersey Royal Court with regard to the settlement?

16

that a relevant issue, as far as your conduct of -- or as a

17

director or as -- of the trust's conduct?

18

THE WITNESS:

Is

I think, without getting into the

19

detail of that procedure, Your Honor, I think what the court

20

is interested in way of, is the scale of the settlement

21

against the possible defenses that the parties have.

22

that is doubly complicated here because not only do you look

23

at the defense of each case on a case-by-case basis, but you

24

have this multitude of (sound drops) and the extraordinary

25

pressures that the trustees are under in trying to conduct

matters in the interests of the beneficiaries.

2

So, to answer your question, it is a relevant

3

factor, but one of many relevant factors, because the court

4

is interested in assessing the possible likelihood of claims

5

exceeding, if they were to be litigated through to a logical

6

conclusion.

the Jersey court's perspective is with respect to the best

THE COURT:

Appreciate it.

Let me try to ask it this way because

I do think there were a couple of mines in both of those
questions, which Mr. White felt he needed to diffuse.

11

I think, Mr. Gold, what you are asking is where

12

you have sought the beneficiaries' views regarding the

13

proposed settlement under the plan, is it your belief, based

14

on that consultation, that the beneficiaries you -- the uses

21

belief in the importance of the use of those funds is

22

subordinate to them obtaining the releases, and that if they

23

do not obtain the releases, they are comfortable with the

24

funds not being released and the beneficiaries of those

25

funds not receiving the benefit of them?

But is it also fair to say that the beneficiaries'

3

Q

4

I'm afraid I'm just not in a position to express that

Okay.

That's -- I appreciate that.

That is fair.

So my other question for you is, hypothetically, were

5

this Court to agree with the position advanced by the

6

objecting states and to rule that the plan could not be

7

confirmed that contains involuntary releases imposed upon

8

the objecting states, opening the prospect of the long-term

9

litigation that you have described, would you expect that

10

the parties for the -- for the trusts, trustees, and the

11

beneficiaries of the trust, and their counsel would return

12

to negotiations in order to avoid the long-term litigation

13

that you describe as so horrible, and to conform it around

It's not easy as to questions,

but I think my view on this is that we have -- we have been

through several mediations.

22

on ad nauseum indefinitely, and we have at long last -- or

we appear at long last to be at a point where most, but not

is the right way forward.

So I don't think being entered into

3

the settlement that the proctors could probably withhold

4

their consent of the sale of any IACs because to withhold

5

that consent would be clearly not in the interest of the

6

beneficiaries of the relevant trusts.

7

BY MR. UNDERWOOD:

Q

9

a variety of beneficiaries to these trusts that may face

10

Isn't it -- isn't it true, Ms. Saunders, that there are

different liability with regard to claims under the plan?

11

MS. MONAGHAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Underwood, I

12

couldn't hear you.

13

BY MR. UNDERWOOD:

14

Q

15

a variety of beneficiaries on a variety of trusts that are

16

administered hereunder?

17

A

Yes.

18

Q

Isn't it possible that, particularly -- and I'll give

19

you the example -- if there is litigation internationally

20

subsequent to the entry of a confirmed plan here, could the

21

results of that litigation impact your best interest

22

determination in any way as to whether or not to sell the

23

IACs under this plan on a best interest analysis?

24

A

25

the settlement agreement is entered into as to whether --

I apologize.

You cut out there for a minute.

Ms. Saunders, isn't it true that there's

That's correct.

I think we have to make that determination at the time

where the interests of the beneficiaries lie.

2

I repeat what I said earlier.

I don't -- I think the

3

consequences of reneging on what was agreed under the

4

settlement agreement by withholding my consent to the sale

5

of an IAC would be serious and extremely detrimental to the

6

beneficiaries as a whole of the -- of the trusts.

7

Q

8

feel that you have sufficient information at this time with

9

regards to global legality of the trusts and beneficiaries

I only have one further question, Ms. Saunders.

So you

10

to commit to the ultimate sale of these IACs that are under

11

a confirmed plan as of today?

12

A

13

in the U.S. and in Canada.

14

litigation claimed or threatened in any other jurisdiction,

15

so we can only deal with the facts as we understand them as

16

they are today and address the risks that are present today.

17

Q

18

are attorneys or solicitors seeking plaintiffs to bring

19

action in Australia against a Purdue entity there and, I

20

guess presumably, the trusts and beneficiaries?

21

A

22

threats of litigation.

As of today, the only litigation that I'm aware of is

I guess my final question is are you aware that there

I'm -- I was not aware of any such litigation or

23
24

I'm not aware of any other

MR. UNDERWOOD:
Honor.

Thank you.
THE COURT:

THE WITNESS:

My recollection of timelines is that

2

there were no A-side family members remaining on the Board

at that time.

MR. OZMENT:

THE COURT:

Okay.

in the (indiscernible) proceeding in Jersey there are

A

There are.

Yes.

MS. MONAGHAN:

Ms. Saunders, are you aware of whether

the A side --

MR. KAMINETZKY:

MS. MONAGHAN:

Yes.
-- that's certainly correct --

MR. KAMINETZKY:

MS. MONAGHAN:

-- Mr. Drain -- I mean, Judge

Drain.

4
5

Yeah, that's --

MR. KAMINETZKY:
Honor.

Sorry.

That's correct, Your

We've concluded the witnesses available for today.

6

THE COURT:

Okay.

7

MR. KAMINETZKY:

We could -- we'll immediately --

8

I think there's one issue we're working out with respect to

9

order for tomorrow, but we'll immediately e-mail Chambers

10

and the parties with the order for tomorrow.

11

THE COURT:

Okay.

Very well.

And again, if you

12

can either point us when you do that or the witnesses --

13

presenters can point us, or those who would tend to cross

14

examine with exhibits, to the exhibits that they intend to

15

use, that would be helpful so that we don't have to -- my

16

clerks don't have to run around the courtroom and locate the

17

exhibits separately.

18

that with witness notebooks and the like, and that is useful

19

and saves time.

20

Okay.

21

MR. JOSEPH:

I know some of you have been doing

We'll resume tomorrow at 10.
Your Honor, Gregory Joseph for Side

May I ask the Court, tomorrow (indiscernible) will be

testifying.

24

reference to having him compare multiple financial documents

25

at the same time.

He is an economic expert, and there will be

Page 267
1

I'm wondering -- I believe it would be efficient

2

and save time if the Court were to permit us to actually use

3

the screen.

4

exhibits.

5

know the Court has been reluctant to have any shared screens

6

of exhibits and will abide by whatever the Court wants to

7

do.

8
9

We have a professional person who to show
I think it would expedite matters, but it's -- I

THE COURT:

Okay.

If you just give me a moment.

Okay.

10

MR. JOSEPH:

11

THE COURT:

Okay.
Unless this can be worked out

12

overnight, it -- the reason for the screen sharing not being

13

acceptable, I gather, is because our tech people believe

14

that they have to become a cohost, which the administrative

15

office isn't prepared to do at this point.

16
17

MR. JOSEPH:

Then, Your Honor, that's fine.

We'll

simply proceed --

18

THE COURT:

You can raise it with Mr. Andino.

19

Maybe there have been discussions about this since then, but

20

that -- I think that's the reason why it doesn't work.

21

know there've been a couple of courts that have done that

22

sort of thing, but basically the administrative office isn't

23

comfortable with it.

24

MR. JOSEPH:

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

I

And -That's --- it also has to do with the number

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 268
1

of people who are signed on.

2

MR. JOSEPH:

3

THE COURT:

4

So --

That's fine, Your Honor.
I think we'll have to go with witness

binders instead.

5

MR. JOSEPH:

6

THE COURT:

That's fine, Your Honor.
Okay.

Thank you.

And while we're at it, I'll

7

just say this for the record too.

8

have the public have more access than just going down to the

9

courthouse at the (indiscernible) if they wanted to see the

10

I'd hoped that we could

hearing as opposed to listen to it.

11

But again, the administrative office of the

12

courts, although it has been very -- they have been very

13

proactive during the COVID epidemic in being flexible to

14

address remote hearings, are still reluctant with regard to

15

the technology for the public generally to view hearings as

16

opposed to listening to them, except to the extent where

17

permitting it is part of this hearing.

18

everyone who wants to is able to watch the hearing

19

(indiscernible) listen to it.

20

So that's why not

Those who are actually participating in the

21

hearing can watch it, but they're not -- just not

22

comfortable enough with the technology to expand it beyond

23

that.

24
25

So we'll resume again, as I said, at 10 tomorrow
morning.

212-267-6868
