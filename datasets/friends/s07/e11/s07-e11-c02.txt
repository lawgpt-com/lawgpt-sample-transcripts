Joey Tribbiani: All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Chandler Bing: So...
Joey Tribbiani: Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Phoebe Buffay: Absolutely!
Joey Tribbiani: I'll see you at 8:00.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Chandler Bing: Oh, what's at 8:00?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Ross Geller: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Phoebe Buffay: Duly noted.
Ross Geller: Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica Geller: What are you talking about?
Ross Geller: Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Monica Geller: You were invited?!
Ross Geller: No.
Monica Geller: My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Chandler Bing: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Ross Geller: Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Monica Geller: Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Ross Geller: Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Chandler Bing: I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
