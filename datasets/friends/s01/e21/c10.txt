Ross Geller: Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross Geller: Yes.
Dr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross Geller: No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Dr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?
Ross Geller: Well I, I don't know. Why?
Dr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross Geller: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Dr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross Geller: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.

Chandler Bing: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Joey Tribbiani: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler Bing: ...He's in.
Ross Geller: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Dr. Baldhara: You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
