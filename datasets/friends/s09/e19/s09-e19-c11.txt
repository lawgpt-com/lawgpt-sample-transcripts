Phoebe Buffay: Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Phoebe Buffay: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Monica Geller: Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Phoebe Buffay: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Monica Geller: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Phoebe Buffay: Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Monica Geller: Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
Monica Geller: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Monica Geller: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
Monica Geller: Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
Monica Geller: I'm sorry...
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry too...
Monica Geller: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
