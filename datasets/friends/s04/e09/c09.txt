Joey Tribbiani: Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Ross Geller: It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Joey Tribbiani: So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Ross Geller: No! I balanced my checkbook.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Ross Geller: I can't believe he didn't come!
Joey Tribbiani: So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Chandler Bing: Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Ross Geller: Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, we could do that!
Ross Geller: There's other stuff too.
Joey Tribbiani: We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!

Ross Geller: Yeah!!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!!
Ross Geller: It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! All right? Let's go!

Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!!!
Chandler Bing: All right!!
Ross Geller: Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
