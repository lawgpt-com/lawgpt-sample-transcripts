Ross Geller: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
unknown: nan
#ALL#: Oooh!
Monica Geller: W-wait. What is that?
Ross Geller: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Monica Geller: No, no, I don't.
Rachel Green: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Ross Geller: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Phoebe Buffay: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler Bing: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Monica Geller: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Ross Geller: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Monica Geller: Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross Geller: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
