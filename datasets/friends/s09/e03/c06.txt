Rachel Green: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
Monica Geller: Excuse me?
Chandler Bing: I know what she's talking about.
Rachel Green: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
Monica Geller: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Rachel Green: Ross said he died.
Monica Geller: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Rachel Green: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Monica Geller: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Chandler Bing: He saw a therapist?
Monica Geller: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
Rachel Green: Why? What was it?
Monica Geller: That I was going to eat him.
