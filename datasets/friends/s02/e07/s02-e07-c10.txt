Phoebe Buffay: Hey Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Phoebs.
Phoebe Buffay: How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Joey Tribbiani: I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Joey Tribbiani: And?
Phoebe Buffay: And we did.
Joey Tribbiani: All right Phoebs, way to go.
Phoebe Buffay: Yay me.
Joey Tribbiani: So, so how did it happen?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
Joey Tribbiani: And what did he say?
Phoebe Buffay: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Joey Tribbiani: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Phoebe Buffay: Um-hum.
Joey Tribbiani: This man is my God.
