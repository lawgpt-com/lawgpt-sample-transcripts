Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Monica Geller: Really? My God, he's really cute.
Phoebe Buffay: Go for it.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, I'm engaged!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
The Cute Guy: Hi!
Monica Geller: Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
The Cute Guy: Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Monica Geller: Well you should be embarrassed.
The Cute Guy: I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Phoebe Buffay: I did, but that was really fun.
