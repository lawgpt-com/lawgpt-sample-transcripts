Rachel Green: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Monica Geller: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Rachel Green: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Monica Geller: You had no relationship!!
Rachel Green: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Monica Geller: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Rachel Green: She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
