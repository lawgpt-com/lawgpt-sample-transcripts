Ross Geller: ...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Rachel Green: Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
Ross Geller: But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
Rachel Green: It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Ross Geller: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
Rachel Green: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: That proposal, at the planetarium...
Ross Geller: I know, I know it was stupid.
Rachel Green: Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
Ross Geller: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
Rachel Green: Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
Ross Geller: It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night.
Rachel Green: Goodnight.

Rachel Green: I will think about it.
Ross Geller: That's all I'm askin'.
