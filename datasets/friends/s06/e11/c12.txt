Joey Tribbiani: Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Janine Lecroix: Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Chandler Bing: That's totally understandable.
Monica Geller: Don't worry about it.
Janine Lecroix: So we can go out again?
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah!
Monica Geller: Absolutely!
Janine Lecroix: Oh good.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh well then, good night!
Monica Geller: Good night!

Joey Tribbiani: See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Janine Lecroix: We have got to move!
Monica Geller: I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Chandler Bing: And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Janine Lecroix: Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Monica Geller: All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Joey Tribbiani: All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Chandler Bing: Y'know I think you can take her.
Monica Geller: You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Joey Tribbiani: All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Janine Lecroix: They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Joey Tribbiani: I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Janine Lecroix: Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.

Monica Geller: What did I tell you about the hall?!
Janine Lecroix: I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Monica Geller: Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Janine Lecroix: Great.
Monica Geller: Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Janine Lecroix: Me too.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Janine Lecroix: I'll see you.
Monica Geller: Bye.
Janine Lecroix: Or I'll hear you.
Monica Geller: That's it big girl! Come on!
Janine Lecroix: Wait!
Monica Geller: You'd better run!

Chandler Bing: Did you hear that?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
