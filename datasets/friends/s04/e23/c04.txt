Emily Waltham: ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Ross Geller: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Emily Waltham: Well, up yours too!
Ross Geller: What?!
Emily Waltham: Oh, that's not what it means?
Ross Geller: No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Emily Waltham: Sorry.
Ross Geller: Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Monica Geller: Chicken Kiev?
Ross Geller: Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Monica Geller: Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Ross Geller: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Emily Waltham: I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Monica Geller: It's nice.
Emily Waltham: Oh. Oh.

Emily Waltham: Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Ross Geller: It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Emily Waltham: How's it gonna be all right?!
Ross Geller: Uh-huh, I see that.
Monica Geller: Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Ross Geller: What? What?
Monica Geller: They tore it down a few days early.
