Chandler Bing: Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Joey Tribbiani: What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Ross Geller: All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Monica Geller: It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Ross Geller: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Ross Geller: You're not his godfather.
Joey Tribbiani: What?! Are you kidding?!
Ross Geller: Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Joey Tribbiani: All right!
