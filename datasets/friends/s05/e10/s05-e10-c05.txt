Joey Tribbiani: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Ross Geller: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Joey Tribbiani: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Wait a second, I could star in it!
Ross Geller: Or that.
Joey Tribbiani: I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Ross Geller: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Joey Tribbiani: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks!
Ross Geller: All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Joey Tribbiani: Done!
Ross Geller: And it can't be Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: It's not.
Ross Geller: Or Joseph.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh.
