Chandler Bing: Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Chandler Bing: Not once did we do that.
Monica Geller: Hi.
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hi.
Monica Geller: So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Monica Geller: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Chandler Bing: And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Monica Geller: I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Chandler Bing: Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
