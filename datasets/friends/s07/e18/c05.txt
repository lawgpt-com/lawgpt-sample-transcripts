Phoebe Buffay: Oh hey!
Monica Geller: Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Monica Geller: Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Phoebe Buffay: All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Monica Geller: And did he?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Monica Geller: Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Phoebe Buffay: I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Monica Geller: Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Phoebe Buffay: You sound like a guy.
Monica Geller: No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Phoebe Buffay: You'll have a last kiss.
