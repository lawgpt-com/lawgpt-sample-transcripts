THE COURT:

Okay.

Good morning.

This is Judge

3

Drain.

4

morning's hearing was scheduled for me to give my bench

5

ruling on the Debtors' request for confirmation of their

6

amended Chapter 11 plan.

7

certain important but still relatively minor changes to the

8

Debtors' tenth amended joint Chapter 11 plan yesterday which

9

is now, in light of those changes, the eleventh amended

10

We're here in In re Purdue Pharma, LP, et al.

This

I received a blacklined version of

joint Chapter 11 plan.

11

I also received a revised proposed confirmation

12

order including proposed findings of fact and conclusions of

13

law which is over 100 pages long.

14

it in detail.

15

comfortable with the proposed findings and conclusions, I'll

16

keep them.

17

of the record as far as the proposed findings and

18

conclusions are concerned.

19

I have not gone through

My ruling will be detailed, and if I'm

I may add to them.

And my ruling will be part

But I understand that the Debtors wanted to

20

address the Court briefly regarding the changes to the plan

21

and the resolution of at least one objection.

22

to hear that.

23

MR. HUEBNER:

24

Can you see and hear me clearly?

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

And I'm happy

Thank you very much, Your Honor.

Yes.

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

Your Honor, for the record,

2

Marshall Huebner on behalf of the Debtors and Debtors In

3

Possession.

4

hopefully positive.

5

A couple of quick updates which I think are

Number one, you know, since the Court's direction

6

at several of the hearings including both Wednesday and

7

Friday, various documents have been amended in a way that we

8

hope now comports with the Court's vision.

9

changes to the plan that we are not going to walk through

The primary

10

unless the Court has questions are to finalize what I would

11

call the material or maybe even radical narrowing of the

12

Sackler releases, which is really on three different axes:

13

Number one, which parties are covered and get the

14

benefit of the releases and those changes I believe are now

15

in;

16

Number two, what is the scope of the releases.

17

And, of course, the Court gave a clear direction that they

18

should be limited very substantially as to scope compared to

19

the original set of agreements reached and filed by the

20

parties;

21

And then, number three, I guess who is bound by

22

the releases.

23

holders of claims and causes of action" to just "holders of

24

claims."

25

several tries and the Court's continuing clear interim

212-267-6868

This is the sort of "any other person to

And I believe that hopefully we got it right after

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 14
1

rulings or directions to narrow the releases.

2

The second item, Your Honor, just for the benefit

3

of everyone's knowledge is the operating injunction for

4

NewCo.

5

other structures in the plan including a brand new board of

6

directors and other things selected by governmental entities

7

to ensure that NewCo does only the things that everybody

8

would want it to be doing and doesn't do any of the things

9

that people would not want it to be doing.

That is one of the many documents along with many

And that's

10

obviously I think part of the sacred mission of many of the

11

parties who have worked on this case.

12

That operating injunction was negotiated by the

13

Department of Justice by the Ad Hoc Committee which of

14

course includes a huge number of AGs, by the NCSG which

15

includes all the rest of the AGs getting us up to 48, and

16

the MSG, as well.

17

it's final and was filed as Exhibit C like Charlie to the

18

confirmation order.

19

frankly, as part of ensuring that on a go-forward basis, you

20

know, everybody can hopefully take comfort in the credible

21

involvement of governmental entities and, of course, the UCC

22

as well who I, of course, need to mention as the official

23

appointee of the Department of Justice to oversee and assist

24

all unsecured creditors in the case.

25

That has now in fully-agreed form, and

That's a critically important document,

Next, Your Honor, also filed I believe yesterday

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 15
1

is the final Sackler settlement agreement which has been a

2

very long time coming.

3

document was negotiated by the Official Committee of

4

Unsecured Creditors appointed by the Department of Justice,

5

by the AHC, by the MDL PACA members who are part of the AD

6

Hoc Committee which includes obviously several dozen

7

attorneys general and, of course, lastly really by the

8

Special Committee of Board which, of course, as everybody

9

knows after an examination was likewise found to be

Just so the record is clear, that

10

fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities with complete and

11

total independence.

12

So that document is now done, as well.

It

13

contains very important things because this is a deal in

14

which the Sacklers are paying over time and frankly

15

something that sounds lawyerly and technical, which are the

16

collateral and the credit support annexes frankly involve

17

some of the most brutal negotiations that actually took

18

months because all of the fiduciaries on our side of the V

19

who represent the Plaintiffs in the case and, you know,

20

frankly, the states and the cities and the victims and the

21

like, you know, need to ensure that the Sacklers are going

22

to pay.

23

And, obviously, credit and collateral and

24

covenants and promises and oversight rights and the like are

25

quite critical to that, and those have now been, we believe,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

negotiated to a place that we can live with.

As the Court

2

has heard me say many times, you know, this is not a perfect

3

deal.

4

the deal that everybody was ultimately willing to agree to

5

under very very complex circumstances.

We would have liked more and earlier, but this was

6

Finally, Your Honor, it just goes without saying

7

that I believe we incorporated everything the Court said.

8

One of the things that the Court will see is paragraph 7A of

9

the proposed confirmation order now further clarifies that

10

no material or substantive changes can be made to the

11

settlement agreement, essentially, and that it's not -- this

12

is the deal.

13

know, any further material certainly concessions to the

14

Defendants in this case subsequent to the order being

15

entered and the documents having gone final.

16

The deal is done, and there will not be, you

Number four, Your Honor, there was a filing we

17

found a little bit puzzling by the U.S. Trustee yesterday.

18

They called us yesterday and raised a question about

19

language in our proposed confirmation order that they

20

believe could be read ambiguously as somehow being -- I

21

think the theory was like a ruling by this Court that this

22

and other courts can't grant future stays.

23

remotely read it that way.

24

and, frankly, it's completely standard language that's in

25

dozens of confirmation orders.

212-267-6868

We didn't

It certainly was nobody's intent

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 17
1

We said, absolutely, let's clarify it.

We thought

2

they were sending language; they didn't.

3

filed a pleading on the docket expressing their concern

4

about the ambiguity.

5

right on it and instantly drafted language that we think

6

makes it clear beyond perventure that there's no possible

7

argument since of course this Court never would, never

8

could, and no one would ever ask it to, you know, try to

9

issue something about future stays.

10

Instead, they just

I guess that's fine.

And we jumped

The point is just we took out the Rule 3020(E)

11

waiver of the 14-day stay so this case does have the 14-day

12

stay under Rule 3020(E).

13

other than that stay, no other stays are currently in place.

14

Obviously, if somebody moves for a stay and they get a stay,

15

we'll all deal with that at the time and, obviously, we'll

16

be ready to discuss that since many parties in this case

17

certainly have strong views.

18

And all the language says is that

So that has been addressed.

They did make a point about 1127.

I just want to

19

be clear.

20

are extraordinarily comfortable beyond a shadow of a doubt,

21

frankly, that the changes to the plan have just made it

22

better and better for the estate as, for example, to give

23

the primary example, we have continued to narrow the scope

24

of the releases in draft after draft while getting the same

25

amount of consideration from the Defendants.

212-267-6868

I think all of the many fiduciaries in this case

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 18
1

So there's no limitation on the number of times

2

you could amend the plan.

The law is very clear which is

3

you can't adversely affect creditors and stakeholders at a

4

juncture like this.

5

have.

6

want to be very clear we believe that all of the changes in

7

this plan

8

filed in March and certainly collectively but even

9

individually have done nothing but improve it further and

The U.S. Trustee is not suggesting we

It almost seems more like amusing to me, but I do

that have happened really since it was originally

10

further and further for the stakeholders for whom many of us

11

serve as fiduciaries.

12

Obviously, they also indicate that they stand on

13

their objection as to both legal fees and the legality of

14

third-party releases.

15

else refiled their objection to make clear that it's still

16

standing.

17

objections are resolved, but certainly things have been

18

narrowed and many items have been resolved.

We certainly understand that.

We understand.

No one

We don't pretend that all

19

Finally, Your Honor, the last I think good-news

20

announcement and I'll turn over the podium in a minute to

21

Mr. Gleit is that I believe that there is now agreed

22

language to effectuate the Court's in essence ruling on

23

Friday about what the Court was and was not willing to do

24

with respect to the DMPs based both on the pleadings and the

25

factual record of the case.

212-267-6868

And so, you know, while that's

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 19
1

not a settlement, it is simply language that we believe

2

effectuates the Court's ruling.

3

that issue is now behind us, as well.

4

You know, I'm hoping that

And so, Your Honor, with all of those updates, I

5

think it's fair to say that I should stop talking except to

6

note that I think we're now down to at the end, you know, a

7

very small number of the core objections about which we

8

heard both extensive trial testimony and argument.

9

have no further updates I can announce because that's not

10

And so I

where we are.

11

But, you know, the final, you know, ten or so sort

12

of meta-objections have been resolved.

We still continue to

13

work with all parties and hope that we can come to a

14

resolution.

But it's just not where we are this morning.

15

So, Your Honor, unless the Court has questions for

16

me, I think that that actually sort of updates the Court and

17

all parties on what's been filed, why it was filed, which

18

things are now in the "done" pile, obviously, but for Your

19

Honor's comments, it goes without saying.

20

proposed to turn my mic off and as Mr. Gleit to quickly

21

summarize the documentation on the DMP issue that Your Honor

22

gave guidance on.

THE COURT:

Good morning.

3

MR. GLEIT:

Good morning.

Your Honor, we heard

4

you loud and clear last Friday.

5

the beginning of this week, we worked with the DMPs and the

6

AHC to work on language which I'm just going to briefly now

7

put in the record a brief statement which says:

8
9

And over the weekend and

"The Debtors and the DMPs have agreed that the
language inserted into 10.10(B) of the eleventh plan

10

reflects the Court's statements made in connection with the

11

DMPs' reserved objection.

12

that the Debtors would state on the record" -- which I'm

13

doing now -- "Section 8.8(B) of the plan does not apply to

14

the settling Co-Defendants."

15

In addition, the parties agree

And, lastly, a provision was added to the

16

confirmation order which is going to make clear that any MDT

17

insurance settlements going forward are going to be upon

18

notice and in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9019.

THE COURT:

Okay.

Thank you.

And I just want to be clear.

3

As I understand it, it leaves open the issues that I said

4

should be left open, which includes potentially as a defense

5

whether the rights to coverage under a policy were released

6

under the agreement between the parties.

7

those rights are direct and established, then as I read the

8

plan, it gives the -- that party that has that, those rights

They're not enjoined by the insurance injunction.

But if in fact

THE COURT:

Very well.

I appreciate the

parties' work on that.

14

All right.

I think that concludes the first part

15

of this hearing which really just went to clarify as noted

16

the recent changes to the plan and updated me on the status

17

of the settlement agreement with the Sackler parties.

18

I'll give you my bench ruling now on the Debtors' request

19

for confirmation of the eleventh amended joint Chapter 11

20

plan.

21

So

It is clear that the wrongful use including

22

marketing of opioid products has contributed to a massive

public health crisis in this country and elsewhere.

role of these Debtors and their owners, and this is a

bankruptcy cases before me highly unusual and complex.

2

This is so primarily because of the nature of the

3

creditor body given the extraordinarily harmful effects of

4

the Debtors' primary product, OxyContin, and other opioids

5

on ordinary people as well as on the local governments,

6

Indian tribes, hospitals and other first responders, states

7

and territories, and the United States who must address

8

these effects on a daily basis.

9

person in the range of the Debtors' sell of opioid products

10

In a very real sense, every

is a potential creditor.

11

Bankruptcy cases present a unique and perhaps the

12

only means to resolve the collective problem presented by an

13

insolvent debtor and a large body of creditors competing for

14

its insufficient assets, including especially when dealing

15

with mass claims premised on a harmful product that, as is

16

the case here, causes massive harms or mass harms.

17

Bankruptcy cases focus the solution away from

18

individual litigation to a fair collective result subject to

19

the unique ability under the bankruptcy laws to, under

20

generally well-defined and rare circumstances, bind holdouts

21

who could not otherwise be bound under applicable able.

22

Over the years, courts and the parties to

23

bankruptcy cases have refined and improved on these

24

solutions.

25

these cases involving in all likelihood the largest creditor

body ever.

And I'm not speaking solely of the roughly

2

614,000 claims that were filed, although I believe that is a

3

record, but also as I noted before the people who could

4

arguably be said to be represented by their local

5

governments and their state governments as well as by the

6

United States.

7

Here, too, the parties have worked in unique and

8

trailblazing ways to address the public health catastrophe

9

that underlies those claims.

These cases are complex, too,

10

because the Debtors' assets include enormous claims against

11

their controlling shareholders and in some instances

12

directors and officers who are members of the Sackler family

13

whose aggregate net worth, through greater than the Debtors,

14

also may well be insufficient to satisfy such claims and

15

other very closely-related claims against them that are

16

asserted by third-parties who also are creditors of the

17

Debtors, that is have claims against the Debtors.

18

The questions then are how can such claims be

19

resolved to best effect for the claimants and is such

20

resolution authorized under the Bankruptcy Code and law.

21

The primary questions for me in this case focusing on the

22

Chapter 11 plan that is before the Court for confirmation is

ruling as an oral bench ruling as opposed to writing a

importance that the parties to these cases learn the result

Page 25
1

particularly given this case where the parties I think

2

universally have made it clear, and I fully understand them,

3

that it is important to devote the Debtors' resources as

4

soon as possible to paying victims' claims and otherwise

5

abating the opioid crisis, that there should not be any

6

further delay in my delivering this ruling.

7

The notice of the Debtors' request for

8

confirmation of the plan was set forth by Jeanne Finegan in

9

her declaration and testimony, primarily her third

10

supplemental declaration which served as her direct

11

testimony but also referred to prior declarations that she

12

had provided with respect to the noticing of claimants and

13

potential claimants in these cases.

14

It is clear from her testimony that the notice of,

15

A, these bases; B, the right to assert a claim against these

16

Debtors; C, the request for confirmation of the plan; and D,

17

the proposed broad release of third-parties' claims against

18

the released parties in the plan which is primarily of the

19

Sacklers and their related entities, was unprecedentedly

20

broad with only one caveat.

21

Ms. Finegan's testimony was undisputed that the

22

Debtors' noticing program as implemented under Ms. Finegan's

23

supervision reached roughly 98 percent of the population of

24

the United States and a only marginally smaller number or

25

percentage of the population in Canada and also was

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 26
1

extensive throughout the world where the Debtors' own

2

products might have caused harm.

3

The program was carefully tailored to reach known

4

creditors but also to reach the population at large

5

including through various types of media aimed at people who

6

may have been harmed by the Debtors' products.

7

Finegan's calculations reflect literally billions of hits on

8

the social media and internet notices as well as, of course,

9

reliable studies of the reach of the other means of notice.

10

Ms.

The caveat that I would have is that the notice to

11

those in prison was in part effective, I believe, in

12

providing notices to prisons and to groups working with or

13

known to work with people who are in prison and suffering

14

from opioid use disorder or other adverse effects of

15

opioids.

16

given prison regulations and at times lack of access to TV

17

and radio and other media, prisoners may not have gotten the

18

same high level, and I'm talking again about approximately

19

98 percent of the entire U.S. population, of notice of the

20

case, the bar date, the confirmation request, and the

21

releases in the plan.

22

But it is certainly within my contemplation that

On the other hand, the Debtors and the plan

23

including the personal injury trust procedures have made it

24

clear that they are flexible with regard to late claims

25

against the personal injury trust and the assertion of

United States Trustee also suggested that

4

references to the plan in the notice would have sent a party

5

to a lengthy and complex set of release provisions.

6

true, and it clearly does take a lawyer to parse through

7

those provisions.

8

of the parties' responses to my comments, those provisions

9

were subject to some potential for differing interpretation,

This is

And even then, as reflected by the record

10

although I believe that is not the case now that they have

11

been narrowed.

12

However, the notice that was most widespread was a

13

very simple one that made it quite clear that the plan

14

contemplated a broad civil release of the Debtors'

15

shareholders, the Sacklers, and their related entities.

16

addition, the extensive media coverage of this case also

17

made that point crystal clear.

18

release rather than parsing through it that is the basis for

19

the objections that have been filed and, therefore, that

20

could have been filed, i.e., that it is too broad and not

21

authorized under applicable law, which I believe was

22

pervasively spread throughout the country and in Canada.

23

In

And it is that aspect of the

So I conclude that the Debtors' notice of the

24

confirmation hearing and the proposed releases in the plan

25

was sufficient and, again, unprecedentedly broad.

Next, I should note the vote on the plan by the

2

classes entitled to vote.

It is important to address this

3

issue up-front because if a plan is not accepted by an

4

impaired class in its vote, the plan proponent must proceed

5

under the so-called cramdown provision of the Bankruptcy

6

Code, Section 1129(b).

7

impaired classes have voted in favor of confirmation of the

8

plan, the Court analyzes only Section 1129(a)'s requirements

9

for confirmation and the incorporated provisions of the

On the other hand, if all of the

10

Bankruptcy Code related to it such as Section 1122 and 1123

11

of the Code.

12

Based on the ballot declaration and testimony of

13

Christina Pullo, this plan received I believe also an

14

unprecedented number of votes cast.

15

the plan was in fact accepted by every voting class, thus,

16

obviating the need to proceed with the cramdown provisions

17

of the Bankruptcy Code.

18

And of the votes cast,

In addition, and significantly, each voting class

19

voted overwhelmingly in favor of confirmation of the plan.

20

On average, the vote was over 95 percent in favor of

21

confirmation of the plan.

22

given the very large number of people who got notice, who

23

were entitled to vote, and who actually voted.

24

unprecedentedly large number applies to each of those

25

categories.

under 90 percent, which however -- no member of which,

5

however, has actually objected or has an extant objection to

7

In all cases, it was above 95 percent

I will address separately two objections that

8

allege that the votes should be looked at differently,

9

first, that the plan improperly classified certain claims

10

with other claims and that if they had been classified

11

differently in a separate class, the vote would not have

12

been as overwhelming, although it's acknowledged by those

13

objectors that it would still have been over 75 percent as

14

far as the super majority voting in the class, which is the

15

figure that Congress provided for in Section 524(g) of the

16

Bankruptcy Code when setting a higher bar for the release or

17

channeling of third-party claims in cases where the claims

18

are asbestos liability-related.

19

20

Again, I will address those

In addition, and frankly baffling to me, the

21

United States Trustee has argued that I shouldn't just look

22

at the votes cast but at the votes that were not cast in

23

determining whether the plan was overwhelmingly accepted.

24

That, of course, is not how elections are conducted.

25

is no conceivable way to determine the preferences of those

3

But where a vote is as extensive as this with

4

hundred -- well over 100,000 people voting, under any

5

measure, this plan has been overwhelmingly accepted.

6

of course, it is the vote that counts under Section 1126 of

7

the Bankruptcy Code and in every election, not a statement

8

by a bureaucrat or his or her sense of where the wind is

9

blowing.

10

And,

That's why we have elections.

23

carried their burden of proof.

24
25

And based on my

The provisions of Section 1129(a) that have been
contested by the remaining objections are Section 1129(a)(1)

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 31
1

which states that the plan must comply with the applicable

2

provisions of this title, i.e., the Bankruptcy Code, which

3

incorporates for purposes of the objections that were filed

4

Sections 1122 and 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.

5

In addition, certain objectants have contested

6

that the Debtors have not satisfied their burden to show

7

under Section 1129(a)(3) that the plan has been proposed in

8

good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.

9

The United States Trustee has objected that the

10

payment of certain fees, that is legal fees and expenses,

11

under paragraph 5.8 of the plan, violates Section 1129(a)(4)

12

of the Code which states that it is a requirement for

13

confirmation that any payment made or to be made by the

14

proponent, by the debtor, or by a person issuing securities

15

or acquiring property under the plan for services or for

16

costs and expenses in or in connection with the case or in

17

connection with the plan and incident to the case has been

18

approved by or is subject to the approval of the Court as

19

reasonable.

20

Certain objectors have also contended that the

21

plan proponent has not satisfied the so-called "best

22

interests test" of Section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code

23

which requires a showing that with respect to each impaired

24

class of claims or interests, each holder of a claim or

25

interest of such class has accepted the plan or, that is for

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 32
1

those who have not accepted the plan, will receive or retain

2

under the plan on account of such claim or interest property

3

of a value as of the effective date of the plan that is not

4

less than the amount, excuse me, that such holder would so

5

receive or retain if the debtor were liquidated under

6

Chapter 7 of this title on such date.

7

The objectors who have raised this provision

8

contend that because they're third-party claims against the

9

released parties, the shareholder released parties, are

10

being channeled to the plan trust or otherwise precluded

11

because of the distribution that they would be receiving

12

under the plan, whereas they will not be in a Chapter 7

13

liquidation, the plan fails the so-called "best interests

14

test" comparing that liquidation recovery to the recovery

15

under the plan.

16

Finally, there has been a suggestion, although of

17

the faintest kind, that the plan does not satisfy Section

18

1129(a)(11) of the plan, the so-called "feasibility test"

19

Which states that confirmation of the plan is not likely to

20

be followed by the liquidation or the need for further

21

financial reorganization of the debtor or any successor to

22

the debtor under the plan unless such liquidation or

23

reorganization is proposed in the plan.

24

of those individual objections shortly.

25

I will address each

Although I can find at this point that the plan

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

1

does satisfy the so-called "feasibility test" under Section

2

1129(a)(11), as set forth in the uncontested fact

3

declaration of Mr. DelConte showing projections and the

4

assignability of the Debtors' insurance, the only -- and I

5

would say this again -- nebulous objection on this point was

6

by the holders of certain claims asserted by certain

7

Canadian municipalities and First Nations which contended,

8

albeit I think only at oral argument, that the treatment of

9

those creditors under the plan would be sufficiently

10

disagreeable to the Canadian court presiding over the

11

ancillary CCAA proceeding in Canada when the Debtors request

12

recognition of the plan.

13

First, based on my understanding of the model law

14

on cross-border insolvencies, which forms the basis of

15

Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code as well as the CCAA

16

provisions providing for recognition, I am reasonably

17

comfortable that the Canadian court will recognize the plan,

18

although of course that is the decision for the Canadian

19

court, and not view the plan as unduly discriminatory

20

against Canadian creditors of the Debtor or Debtors in light

21

of what they would reasonable recover from the Debtors if

22

this plan were not confirmed and the different nature of the

23

regulatory regime that governs the Canadian creditors than

24

their U.S. counterparts, i.e., Native American tribes and

25

municipalities in the U.S.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 34
1

It is also my belief that the public policy

2

exception to recognition under the model law on cross-border

3

insolvencies would not be applied by the Canadian court

4

given the narrow nature of that public policy exception,

5

although again, of course, that decision is one to be made

6

by the Canadian court.

7

Further, it appears to me, again, based upon Mr.

8

DelConte's declaration that while recognition is important

9

and would bring clarity and finality to the claims of

10

Canadian creditors against these Debtors, the absence of

11

recognition is not critical to the survival of NewCo under

12

the plan and, therefore, that in any event the feasibility

13

test would be met.

14

I will note further that the plan makes it clear

15

that with respect to any Canadian creditor that has a claim

16

against Purdue Canada which is not a debtor here or a claim

17

against any of the shareholder-released parties that is

18

unrelated to a claim against the Debtors here, i.e., for

19

example, a claim against them because of their role in

20

Purdue Canada, those rights are expressly preserved under

21

the plan.

22

Most of the objections to confirmation of the plan

23

are based on the objectants' contention that the settlements

24

provided for in the plan either are not warranted under

25

applicable bankruptcy law or are beyond the Court's power,

distributions to creditors.

17

regarding the plan's settlement of opioid claims, namely

18

that the treatment of opioid claims under the plan or

insured claims under the plan or arguably insured claims

the Third Circuit in In re Federal–Mogul Global Inc., 684

16

17

this context.

18

I will note that although that was a case driven

19

by asbestos claims, the logic behind the Court's analysis

was based on Section 1123(a)(5) and 1141, not Section 524(g)

Debtors seek here that notwithstanding any anti-assignment

2

provision and any applicable insurance under the plan, the

3

insurance policies or the insurance coverage rights, or the

4

rights to the proceeds could be assigned to the MDT, the

5

Master Distribution Trust.

6

I will note that both of these findings are also

7

warranted given that it appears that at least at this point

8

the insurers who have objected have either disclaimed

9

coverage or indicated that they were reserving their rights

10

to do so.

See JP Morgan Security Inc. v. Vigilant Insurance

11

Company, 58 NYS 3d. 38 (1st Dep't 2017) and the cases cited

12

therein.

13

So I will overrule the remaining portions of the

14

insurers' objection to the extent they actually do remain.

15

And I will note that in light of the colloquy during oral

16

argument with the insurers' counsel and counsel handling

17

insurance issues in this case, Reed Smith, it appeared to me

18

that most if not all of the objections actually had been

19

resolved by the changes to the plan that I've already

20

described.

21

The next objection that I want to address is an

22

objection by the United States Trustee not to the plan

23

settlement and release provisions pertaining to the

24

shareholder release parties, i.e., the Sacklers and their

25

related entities, but rather a separate objection which is

to Section 5.8 of the plan.

2

The plan provides for compensation of a defined

3

term "professionals" which are estate-retained professionals

4

or professionals such as counsel for Official Committee of

5

Unsecured Creditors who are retained pursuant an order of

6

the Court and paid out of the estate's assets for their

post-petition, that is post-bankruptcy filing, work.

8

other groups of professionals are also covered by orders of

to be so with respect to their fees through the effective

11

date or the confirmation date of the plan under those

12

orders, namely the AHC and the multi-state governmental

13

14

Section 5.8 of the plan sets forth the treatment

15

1

payment for personal injury claimants' costs and expenses,

2

payment for the public schools' costs and expenses.

3

The U.S. Trustee contends that the only way that

4

the plan can provide for such payments is pursuant to

5

Section 503(b)(3) or (4) of the Bankruptcy Code which

6

provides that after notice and a hearing, there should be

7

allowed administrative expenses, that is expenses against

8

the estate for post-petition claims, including the actual

9

necessary expenses comprising reasonable compensation for

10

professional services rendered by an attorney or an

11

accountant of an entity whose expense is allowable under

12

(a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of paragraph 3 based on the time,

13

the nature of the extent, and the value of such services and

14

the cost of comparable services other than the case under

15

this title and reimbursement of actual necessary expenses

16

incurred by such attorney or accountant.

17

That section takes you back to Section 503(b)(3)

See In re United

10

Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc., 674 F.2d 134, 138 (2d

11

Cir. 1982).

12

The U.S. Trustee is wrong on this point also

13

because the remaining fees to be sought again are not being

14

sought as an administrative expense but rather as part of a

15

highly-negotiated compromise of those fees and their

16

clients' obligation to pay those fees reached during the

17

mediation in this case conducted by Messrs. Feinberg and

18

Phillips.

resulted from that mediation are subject to court review

Mr. Bloyd's counsel acknowledged at

7

This is not supported by the

The Debtors have established that, as far as the

plan's treatment of the Department of Justice, the plan has

been proposed in good faith under Section 1129(a)(3).

There's no evidence of any attempt to improperly cut off

11

rights that individual victims would have under the DOJ

13

actively and well represented in the mediations in this case

which came up with the funding of the personal injury

trusts.

16

It's well established in the Second Circuit,

17

including in the Drexel case that I'll be citing in a

moment, that the fact that some creditors did not

classified with the U.S. Public and Native American Tribes

defeat the whole conduct of the bankruptcy case.

6

To subject

Given that Section 1129(b) doesn't apply to this

7

issue because of the class vote, the issue is whether the

8

plan's separate classification of these objecting creditors

9

in Class 11, as opposed to the class that they want to be

10

in, is proper.

11

Separate classification of similar claims is a

12

right that a plan proponent has under the Bankruptcy Code if

13

there's a reasonable basis to classify the claims

14

separately.

the plan shall -- I'm sorry, I'm focusing on Section 1129 --

23

designate, subject to Section 1122 of this title, classes of

24

claims.

7

claims in a class, they need to be substantially similar.

It doesn't require all substantially similar claims

8
9

Here, there is clearly a rational basis for
separately classifying these objectors' claims from the U.S.

10

public creditors and Native American Tribes, based upon the

11

different regulatory regimes that the objectors operate

12

under with regard to opioids and abatement, as well as the

13

fact that the allocation mediation, which I'll be discussing

14

at length later, which allocated the Debtors' assets and

15

third-party claim assets among private and public claimants

16

and then separately among the public claimants involved U.S.

17

public claimants and their own regulatory interests and

18

features.

19

The record reflects that there was no request by

20

any of the objecting creditors to participate in that

21

mediation.

judicial notice of the fact as well, that those who did

23

request to participate in the mediation, if they had a

24

reasonable basis to do so, were generally invited into the

25

mediation, including for example, the NAACP.

15

law, a close analogy to the different regulatory schemes

that would apply here to the NOAT Trust.

See also, In re W.R. Grace & Co., 729 F.3d 311, 329-

18

classification was also not in good faith, asserting

basically the same argument that because the Canadian

treatment and classification as the U.S. governmental

22

entities and Native American Tribes, the plan was not in

Besides raising the foregoing objections, the

Canadian creditors object to the plan's release of third-

party claims against the Sackler shareholder released

parties.

collectively later.

To the extent they make the same arguments as

In addition, however, the Canadian objectors have

11

contended that because no money from the shareholder

settlement is being specifically channeled to Class 11,

13

Class 11 creditors should not be enjoined under the plan

14

from pursuing whatever claims they have against the Sacklers

15

or the Sackler released parties based on their U.S. conduct.

Is this a valid basis for the plan objection?

Canadian creditors, the uncontested best interest

11 creditors would receive no recovery on their claims if,

plan.

3

I will note in this regard that there's been no

4

indication in any claim by the Class 11 creditors that the

5

Sacklers would be liable to them based on their conduct

6

related to the U.S. Debtors.

7

really little indication that there's any claim against the

8

U.S. Debtors in the first place.

9

Indeed, as noted, there's

It is clear to me from the liquidation analysis

10

and the record of this case, therefore, that the payment to

the class of unsecured creditors, that is Class 11 in which

these objectors reside, is fair taking into account not only

13

their rights against the Debtors, but also whatever rights

14

they may have against the Sacklers that would be released

15

under the plan, and, in fact, that they would not recover if

16

they were carved out from the release, so I will overrule

that objection.

It also should be noted, although ultimately this

has little bearing on the classification issue, only bearing

7

on the plan release issue, that if the plan had separately

classified the states, although again that would have unduly

80 percent or slightly below 80 percent, in each case, well

above the 75 percent supermajority threshold in the

analogous section of the Bankruptcy Code 524(g).

The objecting states and District of Columbia also

have referenced the alleged impropriety of classifying their

they're not in the same class; they're in different classes,

6

There clearly is a rational basis to classify the

The U.S. has different types of

It actually has secured claims, which are treated

respect to the Sacklers.

12

where the objecting states and the District of Columbia are

classified, the United States has settled its civil claims

with the Sacklers for a specific payment.

Unlike the claimants in Class 4,

mediation process.

to good faith.

212-267-6868

That testimony really is unassailable as

negotiations, which were difficult given the nature of the

2

states, not as weighty of course, but equally reflecting

3

concerns underlying the compromise behind the constitution;

4

you have small states, you have large states, you have

5

states that have been disproportionately affected by the

6

opioid crisis, et cetera.

7

Without that agreement, the goals of the

8

Bankruptcy Code would actually have been jeopardized that

9

agreement, which in fact, the State of Washington recognizes

10

being remarkable, and I too believe is remarkable to get 48

11

states to agree upon an allocation mechanism for abatement

12

procedures.

13

The failure to do so would have resulted in

14

extensive litigation and arguably a fallback on distributing

15

the value of the Debtors' estates, including their claims

16

against the Sacklers and channeled third-party contributions

17

or payments by the Sackler shareholder release parties, not

18

to serve abatement purpose, but rather after extensive

19

litigation cash payments, which I believe would be

20

substantially reduced by the extensive litigation, to

21

individual states for their general use in their treasuries

22

in large part.

proposal made by Mr. Cowan would not have been agreed to by

14

any state other than West Virginia.

15

that proposal or that methodology would have resulted in

16

peculiar allocations of the NOAT Trust money for abatement;

whereby, for example, states with substantially smaller

23

It also is clear that

Page 68
1

the exercise of extensive resources by every state where

2

population is a legitimate measure, as well as the other

3

factors taken into account in the NOAT allocation.

4

That allocation does, in certain ways, respect the

5

rights of smaller states and take into account levels of

6

intensity of harm.

7

states report in some ways measures of intensity differently

8

and, therefore, those measures are not necessarily accurate.

9

For example, the evidence reflects that different states and

However, it also recognizes that the

than others, or record opioid disorders differently.

12

Given that, I conclude that the treatment of the

states in Class 4, and through it by means of the trust

14

procedures and allocations for the NOAT, are being treated

15

substantially the same pursuant to an overall regime that

16

has been negotiated at arms' length.

cite In re Central Medical Center, Inc., 122 B.R. 568, 575

(Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1990), which concludes that a plan that

4

subjects all members of the same class to the same process

5

for claim payment is sufficient to satisfy the requirements

6

of Section 1123(a)(4).

7

Finally, as the W.R. Grace court states, what

8

matters then is not that claimants recover the same amount

9

or that they have equal opportunity to recover on their

10

claims; that's at 729 F.3d 327.

11

The court goes on to state, courts are also in

12

agreement that Section 1123(a)(4), "... does not require

13

precise equality, only approximately equality," citing In re

14

Quigley Company, 377 B.R. 110, 116 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2007).

17

It went on to find that -- that is the W.R. Grace

18

case -- found that the consequences of how and when the

19

class members would be paid didn't produce a substantive

20

difference in a claimant's opportunity to recover and were

21

the result of, among other things, a comprehensive mediation

22

and arms' length negotiations.

23

I conclude the same here with regard to West

24

Virginia's 1129(a)(4) arguments.

25

conclude the same as to another aspect of its argument.

smaller populations like West Virginia in the NOAT

procedures was a separate fund, so-called 1 percent fund,

4

which all the states, other than the small states that would

5

participate in the fund, were going to participate in, with

6

the exception of California.

7

I did not see sufficient evidence on the record to

8

justify California's being excepted from that contribution

9

obligation, if you will, to the 1 percent fund.

However,

10

California has agreed, since the discussion on the record

11

during the confirmation hearing, to change its view and to

12

participate in the 1 percent fund.

13

aspect of West Virginia's objection that I was going to

grant has effectively been granted by the agreement of

15

California that I've just described.

Therefore, the one

recognized the huge impact that the opioid crisis has had on

states like West Virginia and had tried to take that into

20

that impact, but I believe that given the arms' length

21

nature of the negotiation and the acceptable range of West

22

Virginia's treatment even within the writings acknowledged

23

by Professor Cowan, I conclude that its objection under

Section 1129(a)(4) should be denied.

Page 71
1

the objections based upon the plan's third-party release and

2

injunction provisions and the plan settlement with the

3

Sacklers and their related entities, have been asserted by a

4

number of pro se parties, that is parties who were not

5

represented by counsel.

6

I will go through these, which I believe are

7

properly viewed in roughly four different categories.

8

First, Ms. Butler Frank, Ms. Villeneuve, Mr. Cobb, and Mr.

9

Wright have all stated in one form or another that the plan

10

should not give the Sackler family, "... immunity from

11

criminal charges."

12

The plan does not provide a release of criminal conduct.

13

That is crystal clear in the plan and always has been.

14

I completely agree, as does the plan.

It is I think understandable that a person who is

15

not a lawyer and looks at this case from afar through one

16

form of the media or other may have reached a different

17

conclusion; in part, that is because either through

18

ignorance or choice, the plan has been described as

19

providing "immunity" to the Sacklers.

20

clearly immunity from criminal charges; that's how one

21

generally thinks of the word immunity.

22

do that.

Immunity suggests

It simply does not

It couldn't do it and it doesn't.

23

It's important for those who should now know

24

better, whether they are reporters, law professors, or

25

members of congress, to be careful how they use their words

4

5

At a minimum, it reflects that they do not
It also, if they really do know

If anyone that is obtaining a civil release under

6

this plan has engaged in criminal activity, either before or

7

during this case, they are not relieved of the consequences

8

of that.

9

against the release parties, they can.

10

If any prosecutor wants to pursue such a claim

Ms. Graham, Mr. Normile,

Mr. Beois (ph), I hope

11

I'm pronouncing that right, Ms. Willis, Ms. Ecke, Mr. West,

12

and Ms. Farash have all in one form or another contended

13

that it is improper or unfair for the plan to provide only

14

the $700 to $750 million for individual personal injury

15

claimants, while the bulk of the recovery goes to, as one of

16

the objectors stated, wealthy states, hospitals, school

17

districts, ratepayers, et cetera.

18

I have said more than once during this case,

19

including to Ms. Ecke who testified during the confirmation

20

hearing, that one cannot put a price on a human life or an

21

injury such as opioid addiction, and yet, that's what courts

22

do with respect to personal injuries.

23

account a number of factors, which are relevant legally,

24

including potential defenses or dilution of the claim and

25

causation.

14

and I believe the reason they do that is because they are as

15

sympathetic, if not more so, to individual victims as they

16

are to states, hospitals, and other entities.

22

negotiations were at arms' length and in good faith.

I also recognize from the declaration by Jayne

24

Conroy, who is one of those personal injury lawyers and, in

25

fact, with her colleagues probably the main lawyer to, over

Because of that dogged

She described them in her declaration as those who

6

could tie their injury to a prescription, and I took away

7

from it probably the holders who had the most likely chance

8

in a litigation of obtaining a recovery, notwithstanding all

9

of the arguments that the defendants would throw back at

10

them.

11

After deducting a reasonable contingency fee from

12

that settlement, I believe on average the recovery -- and I

13

don't know how the recovery was divided, but just doing the

14

math from the aggregate amount minus a reasonable

15

contingency fee -- was approximately $13,500 per person.

16

I have the declarations of Deborah Greenspan,

17

Peter Weinberger, Gary Gotto, and Ms. Conroy all laying out

18

what they believe was the hard-fought litigation process and

19

negotiation process for the settlement embodied in the plan

20

for personal injury claimants.

21

Ms. Greenspan also details the procedures under

22

the personal injury trust for efficiently, but consistent

23

with the burden to show a claim, to fix the amount of

personal injury claims and obtain a distribution.

Her

Page 75
1

a trust procedure mechanism that minimizes the difficulty

2

and cost of presenting a claim for personal injury, while

3

maintaining a sufficient degree of rigor over the burden of

4

proof to ensure as much of that money can go directly to

5

personal injury creditors instead of further to lawyers.

6

I also have the declaration of Michael Atkinson on

7

behalf of the Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee, which

8

attaches the committee's letter in support of the plan and

9

recognizes the committees role in balancing the interests of

10

personal injury creditors with the states that also assert

11

claims, and strongly supports confirmation of the plan as a

12

balance of those interests.

13

The plan vote, which was approximately 97 percent

14

of the personal injury class in favor of the plan, strongly

15

argues that the members of that class support the plan and

16

the fairness, albeit only in this setting where one

17

allocates money from a limited pot based not on a non-legal

18

view of the value of a human life or a person's health, but

19

based upon the likelihood of such claims recovering in a

20

contested setting and a, I believe, successful resolution of

21

that under the plan that provides for early monies out to

22

personal injury creditors ahead of the states and fair

23

procedures that make it relatively easy, though preserving

24

the burden of proof, to obtain a recovery.

3

concerns, as do all of the objectors, although as I said

4

before, I believe the first group of objectors have been

5

misled into thinking that the plan provides for release of

6

any criminal conduct.

7

Both of these people have very legitimate

Ms. McGaha and Ms. VomSaal question why NewCo

8

under the plan will continue to sell opioids in any form.

9

Ms. McGaha also recommends certain measures that could be

10

viewed as abatement measures, such as different disclosures

11

regarding long-term opioids or the banning of long-term

12

opioids, changes in packaging and the like.

13

I believe strongly that every constituency in this

14

case that has had a say on this issue has wanted to ensure

15

that the lawful production and sale of this dangerous

16

product be not only lawful, but conducted in a way that is

17

cautious, subject to layers of oversight, and informed by

They have also been a focus, since the start of

2

this case, of all of the states and political subdivisions,

3

and I believe soon after the start of this case, of the

4

other institutional creditors like hospitals.

5

The Debtors have not, since before the start of

6

this case, had the Sacklers play any role whatsoever in

7

their management.

8

focused and volunteered, at the start of this case, an

products.

11

Those measures are described in Mr. Lowne’s

12

declaration as well as the fact declaration of Mr. DelConte.

13

They were also discussed in the Michael Atkinson declaration

14

and the attached letter from the Creditors Committee, and

15

they are reflected again in the provisions of the plan that

16

I’ve just described.

17

The Bankruptcy Code does not require this but, in

18

keeping with the broad determination of 1129(a)(3) good

19

faith requirement, the parties in interest in this case have

20

required it, and I have encouraged them to do so.

21

at this point, I believe that the measures that I have just

22

described will set a standard not only for this company but

23

for other companies that manufacture and distribution these

24

products which are legal yet dangerous.

4

also in their interest to imitate them.

5

imposed by a government; they’re being imposed by this plan

6

with the input of state governments and the federal

7

government and, again, not only should serve as a model but

8

a warning to similar companies to take extra care than is

9

required by the FDA or Congress or state law or be held up

They’re not being

10

against this model in the future and be found lacking if

11

they did not at least take the level of care set forth in

12

this model of governance.

13

The abatement programs themselves are the subject

14

of substantial, again, unrebutted testimony, including by

15

Gautam Gowrisankaran, Dr. Rahul Gupta, as well as, as far as

16

the distribution procedures and abatement activities,

17

William Legier and Gayle Galan and, of course, the abatement

18

initiatives have the heavy input of the states and non-state

19

governmental entities.

20

abatement metrics and mechanisms, again, is an incredible

21

achievement given the strong views that various parties have

22

as to what is proper as far as abatement is concerned.

To have reached agreement on these

23

Mr. Gowrisankaran’s testimony, again, is unrefuted

24

and I believe cogent that there is a clear multiplier effect

25

of dedicating the bulk of the Debtor’s value, including

their recovery from the Sackler, to abatement programs as

2

opposed to individual payments to be used perhaps for

3

abatement but not necessarily so.

4

The foregoing testimony also shows, as do the

5

abatement metrics, that the plan sets forth abatement

6

metrics and procedures that take into account developments

7

over time and learning over time as to what works and what

8

doesn’t.

9

feature of the plan is the requirement for periodic reports

10

as to the use of the funds for abatement, which can then be

11

checked to see what works and what doesn’t, and what can be

12

reallocated to what works.

Indeed, they encourage that learning because one

13

The abatement procedures and metrics also include

14

a consultative process that takes into account the views of

15

communities and those within the community in a reasonable

16

and fair way.

17

The objections that I just described really don’t

18

lay out, and I didn’t expect them to lay out because, again,

19

they’re pro se objectors, a legal basis for the objection.

20

I believe, though, that the proper prism within which to

21

analyze the objection legally is, again, the good faith test

22

under 1129(a)(3).

23

Given all that I’ve just described, it is very

24

clear to me that the use of the bulk of the Debtors’ value

25

for abatement purposes is clearly in good faith and, in

fact, highly beneficial to those who have individual claims

2

against the Debtors as well as the communities and states

3

that also have claims.

4

It is also clear to me that those procedures, both

5

for abatement and for the governance of NewCo, are

6

facilitating not only the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code,

7

but the broader good.

8

somehow this was an ill-cooked and cooked in secret stew,

9

which I don’t believe the two objectors are contending but

To suggest otherwise, to suggest that

10

it has been suggested publicly by those who I don’t think

better, is simply incorrect and dramatically so.

13

What this plan does within the constraints of

federal law, including the regulations and guidance from the

FDA is go beyond that law where that can be done to ensure,

third-party release and injunction of claims against the

settling parties.

18

One point should be addressed first with regard to

19

this inquiry, and I’m addressing it first in part because it

20

has been raised by the pro se objectors and I believe raised

21

because of what they have read or heard in the media and

22

perhaps from others.

23

Some of them assert that this Chapter 11 plan and

24

the settlement in it is the Sacklers’ plan, or perhaps

25

artfully, some may mislead them by suggesting that, as it is

these claims asserted or assertable by the Debtors' estates,

are a normal part of the process of reorganization in

5

is in part for the obvious reason that in bankruptcy, the

pie is not large enough to feed everyone in full.

Therefore, the cost delay factor in deciding whether to

While, obviously, an assessment of

there's not enough to go around are also greater in a

Ferry Case, courts in this circuit have long considered the

2

following factors in evaluating settlements:

3

(1) The probability of success, should the issues

4

be litigated, versus the present and future benefits of the

5

settlement, without the delay and expense of litigation and

6

subsequent appeals;

7

(2) the likelihood of complex and protracted

8

litigation if the settlement is not approved, with its

9

attended expense, inconvenience and delay, including the

10

difficulty on collecting on the judgment;

11

(3) the interests of the creditors, including the

12

degree to which creditors support the proposed settlement;

13

(4) whether other interested parties support the

14

settlement;

15

(5) the competency and experience of counsel

16

supporting, and the experience and knowledge of the court in

17

reviewing the settlement;

18

(6) the nature and breadth of the releases to be

19

obtained by officers and directors or other insiders; and

20

(7) the extent to which the settlement is the product of

21

arms-length bargaining.

See generally, In re Iridium

distribution plan complies with the Bankruptcy Code's

25

priority scheme will often be the dispositive factor.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

That

516-608-2400

Page 90
1

is, unless the remaining factors weigh heavily in favor of

2

approving a settlement, if the settlement varies materially,

3

the priority scheme of the Bankruptcy Code, a court should

4

normally not approve it.

5

That issue does not apply here.

As I have noted in dealing with the objections to

6

classification and treatment under the plan, the plan does

7

not vary the priority scheme of the Bankruptcy Code or

8

otherwise violate the classification requirements and

9

treatment within a class of the Bankruptcy Code.

10

I will address these factors, or these elements of

11

evaluating a settlement in a different order than laid out

12

by the courts following the Iridium case.

13

they are applied even in context where part of the

14

settlement involves not the simple trade of money for a

15

claim, but also performance outcomes, such as ceasing to be

16

involved with a product or the agreement by the Sacklers to

17

the document depository and the like.

18

20

I will note that

See, for example,

As I've noted, this settlement was clearly and

21

unmistakably the product of arm's-length bargaining

22

conducted in two separate mediations by capable mediators,

23

preceded by the most extensive discovery process, not only

24

I, but I believe any court in bankruptcy has ever seen.

25

Again, the record is unrefuted as to the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 91
1

incredible extent of discovery taken, not only by the

2

Debtors through their Independent Committee, which again,

3

truly was independent, but also the Official Unsecured

5

states group and the other states and governmental entities,

6

in fact anyone who wanted to sign the standard nondisclosure

7

agreement to permit the discovery to proceed without

8

extensive discovery fights over confidentiality.

9

From the very first day of the case, I made it

10

clear, as recognized also by Chief Justice Judge McMahon in

11

her affirmance of the injunction that I entered, that the

12

Sackler parties and their owned and related entities would

13

have to provide discovery far beyond the normal fishing

14

expedition discovery in bankruptcy cases in order to have

15

the benefit of the temporary injunction or any final stay,

16

and that is exactly what happened.

17

I did not have to decide one discovery dispute on

18

the record.

20

every instance, additional discovery.

2

extremely capable counsel that assisted the Independent

Committee in discovering the Debtors' claims against the

4

Sacklers, which are laid out in the uncontroverted

5

declarations of Richard Collura and Mark Rule, and then

6

commented on by John Dubel on behalf of the Board of Special

7

Committee, the Debtors identified over $11 billion of

8

potentially avoidable transfers to various Sackler

9

individuals or entities.

10

The Creditors Committee did its own discovery,

11

including vetting that extensive exercise.

12

thoroughly investigated estate claims that are not in the

13

nature of avoidance claims avoiding transfers, but claims,

14

for example, piercing the corporate veil and breach of

15

fiduciary duty, which would belong to the estate, here,

16

I believe, because at least as far as the record reflects,

17

the basis for such claims would be a generalized injury to

18

the estate and all creditors, rather than to individual

19

creditors.

They know what they had access

The only argument they can make -- and I will
address that in the future -- is that the public hasn't had

10

access to it.

11

the way it was by the public's representatives, including

12

the very states that make this argument, there would not

13

have been that level of discovery, because it is not the

14

type of discovery that the public would ever have access to,

examination.

17

But, of course, if it had not been conducted

Factors 3 and 4 are closely related to each other,

the interests of creditors, including the degree to which

19

creditors support the proposed settlement, and four, whether

20

other interested parties support the settlement.

21

I'm talking solely about the settlement of the Debtors

22

estate's claims.

23

And again,

Given the plan vote, given the support by the

states, 95 percent-plus of the other governmental entities,

and apparently in this context, the United States --

2

although one can't really make heads or tails of the U.S.

3

Trustee's objection on this point -- it is clear that the

4

creditor body by an overwhelming margin supports the

5

settlement, again, after being fully informed in making that

6

decision, or having their representatives be fully informed

7

in making that decision.

8
9

The second issue, or the second factor, which now
is next to last, includes an assessment of cost first, i.e.,

10

the likelihood of complex and contracted litigation if the

11

settlement is not approved, and secondly, the difficulty in

12

collecting on a judgment.

13

first, I'll focus on that latter part first, i.e., the

14

difficulty of collecting on a judgment.

15

I'll focus on that latter point

As is often the case, parties who support a

16

settlement, such as here, the Creditors Committee, the

17

consenting states, the non-consenting states who now

18

consent, and the Debtors are careful not to lay out all of

19

the reasons that they support the settlement, which usually

20

go to an assessment of the merits, but generally cover legal

21

issues, including legal entitlements to collection, because

22

they are legitimately worried that either, A, the settlement

23

won't be approved, in which case they're actually going to

24

have to run the risk of having given their opponent a

25

roadmap as to the weaknesses in their case and the strengths

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 95
1

in the opponents' case, and a roadmap as to their assessment

2

of the difficulty of collection.

3

And of course, the settlement in itself does not

4

require -- because then it would not be a settlement -- a

5

full litigation on the merits or collection.

6

simply not, obviously, the purpose of a settlement.

7

Instead, the circuit has directed the Court to make an

8

informed judgment based on the record before it, taking into

9

account these factors.

I mean, that's

10

At one level -- and again, it is the level that

11

has been reported in the media by some -- one would think

12

that this factor clearly weighs against the settlement.

13

record, I believe, is uncontroverted that the Sacklers, as a

14

family, are today worth -- again, in the aggregate --

15

approximately $11 billion.

fees, et cetera, and the discovery has largely been taken as

14

I want to be clear.

I am not deciding that issue.

15

Nor am I deciding whether the trusts that most of the

16

Sackler Family wealth are held in are in fact spendthrift

17

trusts that could not be invaded to collect a judgment,

18

including in a possible bankruptcy case, if the beneficiary

19

of that trust were forced into bankruptcy by a pursuit of

litigation by the Debtors or, frankly, by a third-party.

I have the expert declaration of Michael Cushing,

8

an expert in the law of the Bailiwick of Jersey and the

9

enforceability of judgments, that is, U.S. judgments,

against trusts organized under that law.

There is a

11

substantial issue in my mind as to the collectability under

12

that law, even of a fraudulent transfer claim, although, it

13

is clear to me that under the law of various jurisdictions

14

in the U.S., including New York, that a transfer that is

15

fraudulent to creditors into a spendthrift trust is

16

recoverable for the benefit of creditors.

See Securities

20

In addition, U.S. law does not recognize self-

21

settled trusts that in name only are spendthrift trusts.

22

But again, most of the trusts here are governed by Jersey,

23

that is the Bailiwick of Jersey, law, which according to Mr.

24

Cushing's declaration, which is unopposed on these points,

25

strongly suggests that a different result might apply when

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 98
1

one would go to enforce a judgment obtained in the U.S. for

2

a fraudulent transfer, or on an in personam debt to the

3

trust in the Bailiwick of Jersey, through the Viscount of

4

Jersey and the Jersey court.

5

Again, I'm not deciding those issues, but given

6

the record before me, and given the agreement of

7

substantially all of the parties in this case to reach a

8

settlement of the estate's claims with the Sacklers, and the

9

due diligence which they have undertaken, which has not been

10

undertaken by the U.S. Trustee, one could infer that the

11

issue of collection is at least a real one.

12

In addition, Iridium factor number two also takes

13

into account, or requires the Court to take into account,

14

the cost and delay of continued litigation, as opposed to

15

the benefits of a settlement.

16

believe, on an uncontroverted basis for not approving the

17

settlement would be substantial.

claims, the estate's claims, were not approved, the parties

And I believe that the record here

Page 99

would be back essentially to square one on allocating the

2

value of the Debtors' estate, including any ultimate

3

recovery on the estate's litigation claims.

4

In that regard, the litigation analysis reflected

5

in Mr. DelConte's second declaration, which contains a

6

liquidation analysis, is instructive.

7

realistic scenarios, there would be literally no recovery by

8

unsecured creditors from the estate in a Chapter 7

9

liquidation, which is, I believe, the most likely result if

Under the most

10

this settlement were not approved, given the unraveling of

11

the heavily negotiated and intricately woven compromises in

13

One reason for that is that in a liquidation

14

scenario, the United States' agreement to forego $1.7

15

billion of its $2 billion superpriority administrative claim

16

for the benefit of the abatement program by the states would

17

18

The United States would be entitled to all of

That leaves the last factor, which really in most

20

settlements is the most, or depending on the difficulty of

21

collection, one of the most important factors, namely a

22

comparison of the results of litigation as against the

23

results of a settlement.

24
25

As I noted, as with the issue of difficulty of
collection, the parties supporting the settlement have been

212-267-6868

Page 100
1

careful not to lay out their views of the defenses that the

2

Sacklers released parties would have to the estate's claims.

3

And of course, because it is a settlement, there's been no

4

trial on the merits of those claims.

5

On the other hand, I do have reports as to the

6

nature of the transfers, when they occurred, what they were,

7

and who they were to, and also some testimony as to the

8

involvement of some of the Sacklers in the running of

9

Purdue, which is relevant to the estate's claims, separate

10

and apart from avoidance of fraudulent transfers, namely

11

claims for piercing the corporate veil, alter-ego liability,

12

breach of fiduciary duty, and the like.

13

I also have an extensive submission by both sides

14

of the Sackler Family, or submissions by both sides of the

15

Sackler Family, that do state the defenses they would argue.

16

I heard the testimony of four members of the Sackler Family,

17

two from Side A and two from Side B, and that too is

18

informed by views on the merits here, although that

19

testimony primarily went not to fraudulent transfer claims

20

but to other claims related to their role in Purdue's

21

governance, and the decisions made that have led to

22

trillions of dollars of claims being filed against Purdue

23

and a criminal plea and settlement by Purdue with the

clearly, both it and the process in arriving at it has not

12

I will note, finally, that as alluded to this

14

enforcement mechanisms that are quite rigorous as part of

15

the settlement agreement, so that the collection problems

that I had addressed, or the potential collection problems,

are far lessened by the settlement if they don't live up to

the estate's claims, when considering the alternative to the

There are multiple grounds for the objecting

10

learn that those claims had been released by the Debtors

The first objection to the third-party release of

2

the Sacklers is a jurisdictional one, i.e., the contention

3

that the Court lacks jurisdiction -- subject matter

4

jurisdiction, to impose the release of the shareholder

5

released parties on those who do not consent to it and who

6

have, in fact, objected to it.

7

It's axiomatic that federal courts, including the

8

bankruptcy courts, have only the jurisdiction given to them

9

and no more.

Under 28 U.S.C. Section 1334(b), however, the

10

bankruptcy courts, through the reference from the district

11

courts in 28 U.S.C. 157, do have broad jurisdiction with

12

respect to matters that are related to the Debtors' property

13

and case.

The Second Circuit has extensively dealt with this

actions to stay or prevent the assertion of third-party

11

claims in bankruptcy cases, the most recent version of

12

which, which the objectors largely ignored, if not entirely

13

ignored, is the Second Circuit's decision in In re Quigley

14

Company, 676 F.3d 45 (2d Cir. 2012).

15

The court there went through a lengthy analysis of

16

its jurisdiction -- bankruptcy jurisdiction, that is -- to

17

preclude the pursuit of a third-party claim, including an

18

analysis of Section 1334 of the Judicial Code which provides

19

for original jurisdiction in the district courts, which is

"all cases under Title XI," and "all civil proceedings

22

arising under Title XI or arising in or related to cases

23

under Title XI."

24
25

The dispute in Quigley reflected some arguable
confusion in the Second Circuit over the extent of this

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

jurisdiction when dealing with an injunction of third-party

2

claims, including under a plan, that was arguably injected

by the circuit in a case that the objectors do extensively

Bailey, 557 U.S. 137 (2009), which the Circuit in the

In that case, the Circuit had left the impression

that the only source for jurisdiction to enter a course of

54.

The Circuit went on to say, because the third-party's

2

mistake as to the nature of the jurisdictional inquiry under

4

caselaw's treatment of derivative liability in the context

6

addressing this subject in some detail.

7

It then goes on to state, "After analyzing

requirement of a derivative claims for the exercise of

12

of the third-party claim on the estate."

13

Rather, the claim was based upon the effect

The Circuit then went on to state, "Manville III

After Manville

15

II, as before, a bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to enjoin

16

third-party non-Debtor claims that directly affect the res

17

of the bankruptcy estate.

18

"As in MacArthur, the salience of Manville III's

19

inquiry as to whether Travelers' ability was derivative of

20

the Debtor's rights and liabilities was that, in the facts

21

and circumstances of Manville III, cases alleging derivative

22

liability would affect the res of the bankruptcy estate,

23

whereas, cases alleging non-derivative liability would not.

action must both directly affect the estate and be

3

56 through 57.

4

676 at

It then further discussed the Manville IV case and

5

then stated, "It thus appears that our case, from our

6

caselaw, that while we have treated whether a suit seeks to

7

impose derivative liability as a helpful way to assess

8

whether it has the potential to affect the bankruptcy res,

9

the touchstone for bankruptcy jurisdiction remains 'whether

10

its outcome might have any conceivable effect on the

11

bankruptcy estate.'"

12

This test has been -- I'm continuing now, because

13

I'm omitting the citation.

"This test has been almost

14

universally adopted by our sister circuit," citing the

15

Celotex Corp. that I previously cited, collected case,

16

"which in some instances have found bankruptcy jurisdiction

17

to exist over non-derivative claims against third-parties.

Inc., 810 F.2d 782, 786 (8th Cir. 1987).

21

And then stating, "A suit against a third-party

22

alleging liability not derivative of the Debtors' conduct

23

but that nevertheless poses the specter of direct impact on

the res of the bankrupt estate may just as surely impair the

"Accordingly, we conclude that where litigation of

5

certainly result in the drawing down of insurance policies

6

that are part of the bankruptcy estate of the Debtor, the

exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction to enjoin these suits

was appropriate."

9

I conclude here, based upon the adverse effect of

10

the third-party claims that are covered by the shareholder

11

release, as I will further narrow it, do affect the res of

12

the estate, including insurance rights, and rights to

13

indemnification and the Debtors' ability to pursue its own

14

claims.

15

Certain of the objectors cite a pre-Bankruptcy

16

Code, pre-28 U.S.C. Section 1334 case from the Supreme

17

Court, Callaway v. Benton, 336 U.S. 132 (1948), for the

18

proposition that there is no such jurisdiction.

19

Section 1334 is broader than the jurisdictional mandate that

20

applied at that time in that case.

21

Of course,

"It is rather a dramatic change to the

before that time and is meant to be interpreted broadly, as

laid out by the caselaw, as well as commentators.

19

the bankruptcy court to ever impose a release of a third-

20

party claim as a jurisdictional matter, which case cites the

21

Callaway v. Benton case, and does not cite the Quigley case

22

because -- well, I don't know why, maybe it wasn't raised to

The other aspect of the due process objection goes

8

to the notice that was provided with respect to the release.

9

It is now clear, under the plan, that only holders of claims

10

against the Debtor or Debtors are being released under the

11

third-party shareholder release, and it is clear from the

12

factual record that holders of claims received, in my view,

13

due process notice, not only of the bankruptcy case, but of

14

the plan's intention to provide a broad release of third-

15

party claims against the shareholders and their related

16

entities related to the Debtors as a whole.

17

Indeed, at that time, with that notice, including

18

the simple form notice that went out, the release was far

19

broader than it is today.

20

complicated then, because it was broader, is somehow a

21

violation of due process, is equally incorrect.

22

the issue of what process is due requires a court to ask

23

whether in the connection with the confirmation hearing

24

notice was sent that was reasonably calculated under all the

25

circumstances to apprise interested parties of the pendency

notice turns upon what is reasonably known by the Debtor of

It appears, to me, again, based upon Ms. Finegan's

20

is, in fact, sufficient.

3

If someone can make the case after the fact that

4

they did not receive the type of notice that Ms. Finegan

5

testified to or the Debtor could be said to be aware of them

6

actually, and therefore, given them improved notice, they

7

would have the right to come back and argue that, as was the

8

case in the Motors Liquidation Second Circuit opinion that

9

I've cited.

10

But as far as the record before me is concerned, I

11

find that the notice of the plan, confirmation hearing and

12

request for approval of the third-party release satisfied

13

due process.

14

The next objection to the third-party release

15

provision in the plan pertaining to the shareholder

16

settlement is an objection based on the power of the

17

bankruptcy court to issue a final order confirming the plan

18

as opposed to the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction to approve

19

confirmation of the plan as it related to jurisdictional

20

matter under 1334(b) and (a).

21

This issue was not addressed until fairly

22

recently, but it has been addressed now at length in two

23

opinions that I will simply refer to, because I believe the

24

logic of these opinions cannot be improved upon as far as

25

2

a Chapter 11 plan should be confirmed or not, which is the

3

fundamentally central aspect of a Chapter 11 case, is, in

4

fact, core, not only under 28 U.S.C. 157(b) but also core as

5

a constitutional matter, being within the power

6

traditionally exercised by bankruptcy courts to confirm

7

plans and provide for the allocation of property of the

So, I will refer parties to those opinions.

I will note that in that affirmance, the Circuit

23

did not reach the determination by former Chief Judge

24

McMahon that this was a core -- this type of injunction is a

25

core proceeding within a core proceeding, but I believe her

distinguish her statement in Dunaway v. Purdue Pharma, LP,

3

4

plan, but rather a request for a preliminary injunction

6

concluded, I believe correctly, although she was reversing

7

The following can be said about those three cases

8

or the line of cases from those three courts.

First, they

9

are based fundamentally on a view that Section 524(e) of the

10

Bankruptcy Code precludes the grant of such a release.

11

section says, "Except as provided in Subsection A3 of this

12

Section" -- which is irrelevant here -- "discharge of a debt

13

of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other

14

entity on or the property of any other entity for such

15

debt."

16

That

I will note in a moment that several of the cases,

17

and I believe they employ the right analysis, including the

18

Second Circuit's Manville I case, refute that view as a

19

statutory matter.

20

Lumber case, the Fifth Circuit noted, "Non-debtor releases

21

are most appropriate as a method to channel mass claims

22

toward a specific pool of assets in a context of 'global

23

settlements' of mass claims against the Debtors and co-

24

liable parties," citing a similar observation by the Fifth

25

circuit in Feld v. Zale Corp., 62 F.3d 746, 760-61 (5th Cir.

212-267-6868

I will note further that in the Pacific

2

That quote was from 584 F.3d 252 from the Fifth

3

Circuit's Pacific Lumber case.

I will note further, that

4

notwithstanding its reliance on Section 524(e) as precluding

5

any release which the Circuit had in Lowenschuss and prior

6

case such as In re American Hardwood, 885 F.2d 621 (9th Cir.

7

1989), equated with a discharge.

8

Circuit held that a release of a third-party claim limited

9

to actions taken in or related to the bankruptcy case could,

The circuit -- the Ninth

10

in appropriate circumstances, be imposed in a plan, which

11

undercuts the 524(e) analysis, since post-bankruptcy, pre-

12

confirmation claims would be subject to the discharge as

13

well.

961 F.3d 107 -- I'm sorry.

14

See Blixseth v. Credit Suisse, 961 F.3d 1074,

15

1081-85 (9th Cir. 2020).

16

Western Real Estate Fund case from the Tenth Circuit from

17

1990 did recognize, as the American Hardwoods case also

18

recognized, the propriety of imposing a temporary stay of

19

third-party claims to "facilitate the reorganization

20

process," one wonders why, if one is not bound by the 524(e)

21

arguments, such a temporary stay could not become a

22

permanent stay if the reorganization process would be

23

appropriately facilitated over the objections of a small

24

number of creditors who assert third-party claims.

25

I will note further that the

1

and, I believe, cogently, although fairly bravely, by a

2

court in the Tenth Circuit as not standing for the

3

proposition that 524(e) of the Bankruptcy Code clearly

4

precludes all third-party releases and that Section 105(a)

5

of the Bankruptcy Code and other applicable bankruptcy law

6

might, in appropriate circumstances, justify a release of

7

third-party claims.

9

The argument upon which the three cases that I've

10

just gone through at some length from the Fifth, Ninth, and

11

Tenth Circuit, which go against the majority of cases

12

dealing with third-party releases, relies upon a theory that

13

Section 524(e)'s language, which I've quoted, precludes to

14

grant a release as part of a settlement under a plan.

15

This view, I believe, is appropriately addressed

16

and refuted by a number of courts, including the Airadigm

17

Communications, Inc., 519 F.3d 640, and the Sixth Circuit in

18

In re Dow Corning Corp., 280 F.3d 648 (2006).

19

It's also effectively refuted by the distinction

20

made in the Manville and Lynch v. Lapidem cases that I

21

previously cited, which distinguish a discharge from a

22

settlement of claims.

23

It is also inconsistent with Section 524 itself;

24

524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code specifically provides for

25

certain third-party releases, if certain conditions are met

in a plan that deals with asbestos liabilities and a trust

2

set up for asbestos liabilities, including the affirmative

3

vote of the affected class in a super-majority of 75

4

percent, which, as I've noted here, has been well exceeded.

5

But more importantly, Section 524(h) of the

6

Bankruptcy Code recognizes that this provision, 524(g), does

7

not mean that plans that were confirmed before the enactment

8

of Section 524(g) are, in fact, unlawful.

9

legislative history to the amendment makes that point,

10

And indeed, the

stating Section, at that point 111, but it became 524(h).

11

"Makes a rule of construction to make clear that

12

the special rule being devised for the asbestos claim

trust/injunction mechanism is not intended to alter any

authority bankruptcy courts may already have to issue

16

Indeed, Johns-Manville and UNR firmly believe that the court

1994, where Senator Heflin states, "Finally, Mr. President,

10

with respect to the senator's specific question, this

11

section applies to injunction in effect on or after the date

12

of enactment."

13

What that means is, for any injunction that may

14

have been issued under a court's authority under the code

15

prior to enactment, such an injunction is afforded statutory

16

permanence from the date of enactment forward, assuming that

17

it otherwise meets the qualifying criteria described

18

earlier.

19

It appears clear to me, therefore, under well-

20

reasoned caselaw as well as the code itself that 524(e) is

21

not an impediment to the court's -- statutory impediment,

22

that is, to the court's issuance or enforcement of a third-

23

party claim release in appropriate circumstances.

24
25

That raises the issue, however, what is the
court's statutory or other source of power, which also has

position to comment one way or the other as to whether it's

3

able or not, but it's been discussed thoroughly, I believe,

4

and appropriately applied at the appellate level.

5

Again, see In re Airadigm Communications, Inc.,

6

519 F.3d 640, 657 (7th Cir. 2008), where the Circuit after

7

determining that Section 524(e) is not a bar to the grant of

8

release, states, "The second related question dividing the

9

circuits is whether Congress affirmatively gave the

10

bankruptcy court the power to release third-parties from a

11

creditor's claims without the creditor's consent, even if

12

524(e) does not expressly preclude the releases."

13

"The bankruptcy applies the principle and rules of

14

equity jurisprudence," Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 304

15

(1939), and its equitable powers are traditionally broad,

16

citing United States v. Energy Resources Company, Inc., 495

17

U.S. 545, 549 (1990).

18

"Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code codifies this

19

understanding of the bankruptcy court's powers by giving it

20

the authority to effect any 'necessary or appropriate order

21

to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and a

22

bankruptcy court is also able to exercise these broad

23

equitable powers within the plans of reorganizations

24

themselves.'

25

"Section 1123(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code permits

a court to 'include any other appropriate provision not

2

inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.'

3

In light of these provisions, we hold that this 'residual

5

parties from liability to participating creditors if the

6

release is 'appropriate' and is not inconsistent with any

7

See also Class Five Nevada Claimants v. Dow
Corning Corp. (In re Dow Corning Corp.) 280 F.3d 648, 656 658.

11

I'll now turn to what types of claims can, in

12

fact, be released under that power, a topic that, again,

13

directs one back to the Second Circuit's Quigley case that I

14

repeatedly cited, 676 F.3d 45.

15

In that case, the court extensively discussed the

16

relation of its use of the term derivative claims to both

17

the court's jurisdiction to impose a mandatory release of

18

third-party claims and the court's power to do so, in

19

appropriate circumstances.

20

The use of the term derivative claim which really,

21

I believe began in the Manville III case, which appears at

22

517 F.3d 56, is an unfortunate one.

23

See Donahue v. Bulldog Investments, Gen. P'ship,

The Circuit has spent an enormous amount of time

4

and resources interpreting what I would refer to as true

5

derivative claims, i.e. those that are really claims

6

asserted by third-parties, but properly existing in the

7

bankrupt's estate, and belonging to the estate.

8

this analysis occurred in the Madoff Case where various

9

third-parties tried to pursue for their own benefit as

Much of

brought by the third-party, that would have to be, if there

14

was any recovery, part of the debtor's estate as opposed to

15

collected only by the third-party.

16

In these types of cases, the court looks at

This is the type of claim that is included within

2

The question is what sorts of independent legal

3

claims are properly covered by a third-party injunction.

4

this point, as in so many others, the Circuits' opinion in

5

the Quigley case, albeit in that it discusses liability

6

under Section 524(g), provides real guidance.

On

7

In that case, the party relying upon a third-party

8

release, an insurance company, argued that because the claim

9

against it would not have arisen but for the debtor because

10

the debtor distributed its products, it would be covered

11

properly by the release.

12

otherwise and in this instance, as opposed to in the

13

jurisdictional argument, the Circuit agreed with the

14

claimant.

15

That third-party claimant said

The court concluded that the but/for test creates

16

too much of an accidental nexus to the bankruptcy estate and

17

that instead the third-party claim to be subject to the

18

injunction must arise as a legal consequence of the debtors'

19

conduct or the claims asserted against it such that that

20

conduct must be a legal cause or a legally relevant factor

21

to the third-party's alleged liability, 676 F.3d 45, 59-60.

22

This is a consistent theme throughout the case

23

law, independent liability may be enjoined if it is

24

dependent on the debtor's liability through conduct of the

25

debtor.

2

As stated in the Kardi Corp. case, which I've

3

previously cited, if there is an identity of interest in

4

between the debtors and the non-debtor really sees with

5

regard to the related conduct, which would not exist as a

6

liability to the third-party, but for the debtor's conduct

7

8
9

Similarly, the court in In re FirstEnergy
Solutions Corp, 606 BR 720 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio), referred to

10

an identity of interest with the debtor, and between the

11

debtor and the third-party claimant, where the debtor is

12

primarily liable and one can view the non-debtor parties as

13

secondarily liable, is the relevant consideration.

14

So in construing the propriety of the Court's

15

exercise of its power to impose a non-consensual third-party

16

release, that type of relationship must underpin the

17

release, otherwise the release would be too broad.

2

dichotomy of the Constitution, and there is a sufficient

3

source of that power in the Bankruptcy Code itself, in

4

Sections 105 and 1123(a)(6), as well as in the Court's

5

inherent equitable power, which has been recognized by

6

bankruptcy scholars in this area, including and applying to

7

third-party injunctions, claim injunctions and releases.

8

See, for example Adam J. Levitin's article "Toward A Federal

Common Law of Bankruptcy: Judicial Lawmaking in a Statutory

10

Regime", 80 Am. Bankr. L.J. 1 (2006).

11

I believe that they, to the extent that one is not

needs to be sufficiently bound up in the debtor's own

actions, albeit that it's a separate independent legal claim

15

that would be payable, if recoverable, to the third-party,

16

as opposed to the debtor for the claim to be subject to the

injunction.

18

In that regard, regardless whether I, in applying

19

the standard, which I still have not yet gotten to, as to

20

whether the third-party claim release is appropriate or not,

21

would require that the shareholder releases in paragraph

vary among the circuits.

15

Re Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc. case, 416 F.3d 136, (2d

17

circumstances where courts have exercised their power,

19

furtherance of Section 1123(a)(6) and observed that courts

substantial consideration, the enjoined claims would channel

22

to a settlement fund, rather than extinguished.

2

The court went on to state, however, that this is

3

not a matter of factors or prongs and further that no case

4

has tolerated non-debtor releases absent the finding of

5

circumstances that may be characterized as unique.

6

Recognizing further that such releases can be abused,

7

particularly if they are for insiders, and need to be

9

The Third Circuit has a similar, but somewhat

10

different, standard as laid out in the Exide case, where the

11

court, with the citations omitted, but citing among other

12

cases In re Continental Airlines, 203 F.3d 203 (3d Cir.

considerations might include whether 1) the non-consensual

release is necessary to the success of the reorganization;

contribution to the debtor's plan; the releasees' financial

4

It is also clear to me that the amount being paid

parties is, in fact, substantial.

that other claims that have yet to be liquidated would come

Page 140

cases that have held that a full recovery is not necessary,

and indeed, one would question why you really need a third-

party release when you can project a full recovery anyway.

7

A more relevant consideration, I believe, is

8

whether the plan in its third-party release provision is, in

9

fact, fair, not just to the estate generally and all of the

10

creditors in the estate, but also to those who are bearing

11

under the Third Circuit standard, and I believe a proper

2

It is, without doubt, the case that without these

3

releases the Sackler shareholder released parties would not

4

agree to the payments under the plan, and they,

5

understandably I believe, are insisting on that because that

6

is their consideration in return for the consideration they

7

are providing to the estate.

8

without the releases the plan would unravel and in all

9

likelihood, the Debtors case would convert to a case under

10

I've already concluded that

Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

11

In that context, I've already found that from the

12

Debtor's estate unsecured creditors like the objecting

13

creditors would in all likelihood recover nothing or at

14

most, as set forth in the unrefuted liquidation analysis by

15

Mr. Delaconte, no more than their pro rata share of $600

16

million which is a high-case scenario that I am skeptical

17

about.

18

I've already gone through the dilutive effect

19

resulting from conversion of the case to Chapter 7.

20

question is whether in that scenario the third-parties could

21

pursue the Sackler released parties to make up the amount

22

that they would have lost from the estate distribution by

23

pursuing their third-party claims.

24
25

The

In large measure, my analysis of that reasonably
projected outcome is quite similar to my analysis of the

3

claims against certain of the Sacklers are possibly the

4

strongest of its suite of claims against them and they would

5

clearly be aggressively pursued by a Chapter 7 trustee.

6

problem is that the senior claims of the United States and

7

the costs and risks of pursuing them would eat up most of

8

the value.

the merits of such claims; however, the record before me

16

included the same types of arguments that I'm gone through

already with respect to the Sacklers' defenses to the estate

19

fiduciary duty and the like which all involve conduct by

under U.S. law -- if, in fact, it was the recipient of a

2

3

claims which are not fraudulent transfer claims but rather

4

direct claims which would have to be asserted against the

5

Sacklers -- all of them -- and/or their companies which are

6

held in trust in the bankruptcy-proof trust structure

7

testified to by Mr. Cushing.

8

that structure could not be breached, but I believe it would

9

be very difficult to do so, particularly where the

I'm not, again, ruling that

10

settlement which the trust and the trustees have agreed --

11

or prepared to agree to was undercut.

12

So it would appear to me that the aggregate

13

recovery by the objecting third-parties in respect of their

14

claims against the Debtor and against the third-parties --

15

which, again, I have narrowed to claims that fit within the

16

Quigley rubric -- would exceed materially their recovery if

17

I did not confirm the plan and they pursued their third-

18

party claims separately as well as their claims against the

19

Debtor in the inevitable liquidation of the Debtor under

20

Chapter 7.

21

A related argument made by the objectors is that,

22

contrary to what I've just gone through, the plan does not

23

satisfy the best interest test of Section 1129(a)(7) of the

24

Bankruptcy Code.

25

argument that under the plain meaning of Section 1129(a)(7)

There is a statutory response to that

Veritext Legal Solutions

I believe is well taken.

2

That section, again, provides that with regard to

3

a party that has accepted its treatment under the plan, such

4

holder of the claim will receive or retain under the plan on

5

account of such claim -- and I want to emphasize that phrase

6

-- on account of such claim property of a value as of the

7

effective date of the plan that is not less than the amount

8

that such holder would so receive -- and I'm emphasizing the

9

words "so receive" -- or retain in the Debtor were

10

liquidated under Chapter 7 of this title.

11

that as a matter of grammar, the comparison is between the

12

amount that the objecting creditor would receive under the

13

plan on account of its claim and what it would so receive,

14

again, on account of its claim, under Chapter 7 and would

15

not look to rights that it would retain against third-

16

parties.

17

It is clear to me

I recognize that the interpretation of Section

collection, and the dilutive effect of all of the other

all of the filed claims by the states and territories.

If

I believe that given the paucity of any settlement

of Oklahoma by the Sacklers and their payment to the United

11

States in respect of their civil claims, that assessment,

12

which is fundamentally an assessment by the court of the

13

legal risks and implementation risks of pursuing a lawsuit

14

is a proper assessment, and I conclude again that the

settlement is fair to the objecting states after having

16

conducted that assessment.

17

would depend upon, to the extent they are independent of the

18

Debtors truly -- and, therefore, not truly derivative claims

19

-- would depend largely on finding whether any of the

20

Sacklers was personally responsible for the misconduct of

21

Purdue.

22

the testimony before me was inconclusive on that point,

23

although, clearly, I accept that there is substantial risks

24

for the Sacklers, that point would be won by the objecting

25

states.

Such a trial might actually show that.

I believe

So in addition to that risk for the reason I've

already stated, there are substantial cost and collection

2

risks that I don't need to go through again.

3

As far as the gravamen or the proof that would

4

need to be shown, I've not gone through every state's

5

applicable law on this point, but I will note that the main

6

case that they have cited in their briefs -- Grayson v.

7

Nordic Construction, Inc., 92 Wn.2d 548 (1979) and State v.

8

Ralph Williams, North West Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 87 Wn.2d

9

298, 322 (1976) -- both of which found individual liability

10

based upon the controlling shareholders personal actions for

11

many of the unlawful acts and practices taken by that

12

person's corporation.

13

The last argument made by the objecting states is

14

that the nonconsensual third-party release and injunction is

15

a violation of their sovereignty and police power.

16

no such bar in the Bankruptcy Code itself.

17

including the objecting states' agreement, to the public

private allocation and the NOAT allocation under the plan

and the carve outs from the plan release, the only thing of

be money which they've actually agreed to put to use under

the plan for abatement purposes and which they're not

disputing the validity of -- in fact, the remarkable

reconstructive nature of such provisions.

9

The objecting states nevertheless state that the

10

plan deprives them of establishing a sufficient civil

11

punishment for the released claims, and certainly, that is a

12

valid aspect of the police power, namely, the sending of a

message to others who might similarly, if it is proven

against them, be shown to have improperly engaged in conduct

that would subject them to the liability that the states

is being released.

It is clear to me, however, that the states cannot

have it both ways.

and have further punishment than the plan already provides.

They are not (indiscernible) to make that choice, unlike 80

percent of their state brethren and sisters, but the

consequences of such additional punishment would be to the

detriment of all of the states and the creditors in this

includes, I believe, the agreement by the Sacklers and the

Ms. Conroy, who has been pursuing Purdue and the
Sacklers longer than anyone and harder than anyone, I

10

believe, has noted that that feature of the settlement is

11

perhaps the most important one -- even more important than

12

the billions of dollars being paid by Sackler family

13

members.

14

It is especially important in the public context

15

raised by the objecting states.

16

transparency to the conduct of Purdue and those it did

17

business with and those who regulated it, including some of

18

these very objectors, including the state where Purdue's

19

main offices are, Connecticut, and the federal government,

20

which of course also regulated Purdue.

21

It will provide far more

That record is extremely important, not only for

22

continuing to pursue lawsuits against other parties, but

23

also to guide legislatures and regulators as to how better

incredibly dangerous.

As I've noted the other aspects of the plan that

2

deal with NewCo, also provide a model for either further

self-regulation or regulation by regulatory bodies.

4

Each of the four members of the Sackler family who

5

testified during the evidentiary hearing before me was asked

6

would they apologize for their role and conduct related to

7

Purdue.

Their reactions, as perhaps is typical of a family,

8

varied.

None would state an explicit apology, which I

9

suppose is understandable given the legal risks they face in

10

making such an apology before a settlement, whether there's

11

an objection to the settlement, although I will note that in

12

a somewhat similar context, I have received an apology to

victims of misconduct.

2

So assuming that the change to Section 10.07(b) of

3

the plan will be made, and I will not confirm the plan if it

4

isn't made that I outlined, and assuming one other change

5

that I believe is necessary, I will confirm the plan.

6

so agreeing with the Creditors Committee and everyone else

7

on the other side of the table, including the Debtors from

8

the Sackler family, that I wish the plan had provided for

9

more, but I will not jeopardize what the plan does provide

10

I do

for by denying the confirmation.

11

The other change to the plan that I believe is

12

required is to the provision found at Paragraph 11.1(e) of

13

the plan on Page 146, which directs people who prosecute a

14

cause of action for a nonopioid-excluded claim, which is

15

truly a derivative claim in the normal definition of the

16

term, unless such person first obtains leave from the

17

bankruptcy court.

18

Consistent with my remarks to counsel for the

19

Canadian Municipalities, that provision should be made clear

20

that it provides only to causes of action that colorably is

21

a non-opioid-excluded claim, i.e. if the cause of action is,

22

for example, for a fraudulent transfer claim brought by

23

Purdue Canada or some other claim, it should not have to go

24

through the bankruptcy court.

25

So I will confirm the plan only if the following

their overall assets being in Jersey trusts, but rather in

various trusts.

The B side does not, which is what the evidence shows.

12

Following the entry of the Court's bridge

13

15

injunction is now set to expire today.

Let me now put myself back on mute and

9

They are uncontroverted.

As I mentioned on Friday, there is a provision in

17

the proposed confirmation order that will extend the

18

preliminary injection through the effective date, that is

19

Paragraph 56(a) of the proposed confirmation order.

20

Bankruptcy Rule 3020(e) in Paragraph 66 of the order provide

21

that the confirmation order be stayed until the expiration

22

of 14 days after the entry of the order unless the Court

23

orders otherwise.

24
25

There will therefore be a small gap in the
protection afforded by the preliminary injunction and the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 158
1

voluntary injunction unless the Court enters a second bridge

2

order.

3

So as I foreshadowed last Friday, the Debtors

4

respectfully request that the Court enter another bridge

5

order extending the preliminary injunction to entry of the

6

confirmation order and the expiration of the 14-day period,

7

stay period we just described.

8

but we've spoken to the UCC, the AHC and MSGE and they

9

support this.

So I guess I could go on,

And given my colloquy with the Court on

10

Friday about the Debtor's intention to seek the second

11

bridge order today, I assume the nonconsenting states are in

12

a position to affirm their voluntary compliance with the

13

extension rather than to be formally bound by it, which is

14

consistent with past practices.

15

So if the representatives of nonconsenting states

16

are on, and could indicate that on the record, that would be

17

wonderful.

18

I see Mr. Gold.

14

Debtors, in soliciting the opinions of all those other

17

obviously too late for that.

18

As Mr. Troop said, we certainly have not had

The one question that I do not understand from the

way Mr. Kaminetzky put it, is that we have been given to

understand that that the effective date under the plan

5

MR. KAMINETZKY:

But if they weren't to

Thank you, Your Honor.

The

6

second issue, as Your Honor knows, the shareholders

7

settlement agreement contains a unique enforcement mechanism

8

which we call the snapback in the event that certain

9

breaches of the shareholder settlement agreement occur, the

10

MDT can trigger a snapback by filing a notice with the

11

Court, at which point, both the shareholder releases and the

12

shareholder injunction will unwind with respect to any

13

breaches by the shareholder parties and the MDT, and the

14

releasing parties could then sue the breaching shareholder

15

parties under the release causes of action.

16

To ensure that these remedies are maximally

17

effective, it is necessary to preserve those claims during

18

the life of the settlement agreement or until the parties

19

subject to the snapback have fully performed their

20

obligations.

21

Paragraph 32(a) of the confirmation order, they toll any

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Yeah.

Both sides, A and B, agree

to this and I can't imagine anyone would object --

MR. KAMINETZKY:

to maximally preserve the claims if, God forbid, there's a

We can provide that to Your Honor.

Perfect.

I don't think it expires tonight, right?

Okay.

No.

It will get entered tomorrow then.
Yeah.

Okay.

We have September 15th or
So we'll get that on file.

So you can submit that to

chambers and it will get entered tomorrow.

through it.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, very briefly, Ben

Higgins for the United States Trustee.

briefly, Your Honor?

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. HIGGINS:

May I be heard

Sure.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Just on a

24

procedural note now that Your Honor has ruled.

25

States Trustee intends to file a formal motion for a stay

an expedited hearing.

3

As part of that motion, we would be seeking

Consistent with the case management order, Your

4

Honor, we have conferred with Debtors' counsel.

5

yet reached an agreement on an expedited briefing or hearing

6

schedule, but as the case management order directs, Your

7

Honor, we'll reach out to counsel again tonight and if we're

8

unable to reach an agreement regarding scheduling, we know

9

to contact chambers as the case management order requires.

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

We have not

That's fine.

Your Honor, just so everybody is

12

clear, so we don't get a cascade of emergency pleadings like

13

this, I think Mr. Gold correctly referred to before, it is

14

of record in this case and should be well known to everybody

15

and if it's not, they should be come familiar with it, but

16

our DOJ settlement approved by this Court after a multi-hour

17

hearing as well, expressly contemplates a settlement -- a

18

sentencing hearing not earlier than 75 days after the entry

19

of the confirmation order.

20

eight days -- then seven days after that, which is why, as

21

Your Honor has actually advised all parties at multiple

22

recent hearings, including the KERP hearing, this company

23

can't come out for several months and I think at this point,

24

you know, to start burdening the docket with emergency

25

motions, there's got to be a way to work this out more

212-267-6868

And emergence not earlier than

thoughtfully than unnecessary emergency motions when there

2

cannot be an emergence for really rather quite a while.

3

We don't want anybody to be prejudiced, we

4

understand that.

5

be in dialog about, but we have a history here where we're

6

in dialog with people and we're waiting for a thoughtful

7

response and then they just never call back or email and

8

file something that costs the Estate a lot of resources as

9

multiple parties all have to think about it and respond to

10

That's the kind of thing we're trying to

it.

11

So what I said on the very first day of this case,

12

at the very first hearing, still holds two years later.

13

Please just call us and let's see if we can work something

14

out that is efficient and not a waste of taxpayer resources

15

and Estate resources that does nothing but drain money from

16

abatement and saving lives.

take into account before making such a motion.

Don't tell her that because she's probably valuable

I don't think it is an emergency,

I really don't, which is something you should

MR. HIGGINS:

That's why

we reached out Mr. Huebner twice about this and we will

continue to talk with him to work on a schedule that works

for everybody, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

Among other things, I would hope that

someone would actually be able to read the last six hours of

what I was talking about before they actually decided to do

something.

MR. HIGGINS:

Nothing from the Debtor.
