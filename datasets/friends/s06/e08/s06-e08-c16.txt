Rachel Green: Kim, hi.
Kim: Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Rachel Green: Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Kim: Oh, really?
Rachel Green: Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Kim: You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Ralph Lauren: Hi Kim.
Kim: Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Rachel Green: Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Kim: Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
Rachel Green: You and Ralph?
Kim: Kenny the copyboy.
