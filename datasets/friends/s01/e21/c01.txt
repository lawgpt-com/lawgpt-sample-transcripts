Joey Tribbiani: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica Geller: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel Green: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica Geller: I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross Geller: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler Bing: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Monica Geller: That's me.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Ross Geller: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Rachel Green: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Monica Geller: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Ross Geller: What? It's, it's just a phase.
Chandler Bing: Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Ross Geller: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Rachel Green: Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
