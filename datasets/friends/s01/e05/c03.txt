Joey Tribbiani: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Monica Geller: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
