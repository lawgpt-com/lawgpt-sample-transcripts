Phoebe Buffay: Hey, Lizzie.
Lizzy: Hey, Weird Girl.
Phoebe Buffay: I brought you alphabet soup.
Lizzy: Did you pick out the vowels?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Lizzy: Saltines?
Phoebe Buffay: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Lizzy: What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Phoebe Buffay: I know.
Lizzy: Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Lizzy: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, that's fine, no.
Lizzy: Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Phoebe Buffay: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Lizzy: Please, let me do something.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Lizzy: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
