Chandler Bing: Hey, what did your agent say?
Joey Tribbiani: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Monica Geller: What, forget it!
Rachel Green: Yeah, right.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on, I need your help here.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Joey Tribbiani: You see this, this is a friend.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Joey Tribbiani: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Monica Geller: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, that makes sense.
Ross Geller: Over my dead body!
Chandler Bing: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
