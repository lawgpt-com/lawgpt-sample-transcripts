Rachel Green: Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe Buffay: Sure
Rachel Green: Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Phoebe Buffay: So, what should you have done?
Rachel Green: Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Rachel Green: Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Phoebe Buffay: So?
Rachel Green: Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Phoebe Buffay: Why do you care?
Rachel Green: Because they're people.
Phoebe Buffay: But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Rachel Green: Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
Rachel Green: I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Phoebe Buffay: That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
