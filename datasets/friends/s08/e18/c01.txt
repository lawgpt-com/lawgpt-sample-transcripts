Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Sure. Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: So, who's the guy?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Chandler Bing: Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
Monica Geller: Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Ross Geller: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Monica Geller: Yeah, I'd really like to.
Ross Geller: Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
Monica Geller: Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
Chandler Bing: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Monica Geller: No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
Joey Tribbiani: Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
Monica Geller: Really you can do that?
Joey Tribbiani: Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
