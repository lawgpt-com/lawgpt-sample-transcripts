Gunther: Here you go.
Chandler Bing: Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Chandler Bing: Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Chandler Bing: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Monica Geller: It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe on some level.
