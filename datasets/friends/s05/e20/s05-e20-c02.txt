Rachel Green: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Rachel Green: Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Monica Geller: Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Rachel Green: Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Monica Geller: You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Rachel Green: Great! Thanks!
Monica Geller: All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Rachel Green: Okay.

Rachel Green: Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Monica Geller: I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Rachel Green: Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross Geller: Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Rachel Green: No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Monica Geller: All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Rachel Green: Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Monica Geller: Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
Rachel Green: What?!
Monica Geller: What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
