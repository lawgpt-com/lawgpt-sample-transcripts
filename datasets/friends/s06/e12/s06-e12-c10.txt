Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Gunther: No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Joey Tribbiani: Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Gunther: That's the whole part?
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Gunther: Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Patron: Oh, excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Patron: I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Joey Tribbiani: So, you'd hire me, right?
Patron: For what?
Joey Tribbiani: Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Customers: Huh? What?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
