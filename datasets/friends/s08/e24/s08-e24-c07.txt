Monica Geller: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hi.
Rachel Green: Oh hi.
Monica Geller: I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Rachel Green: Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Chandler Bing: Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Chandler Bing!
Chandler Bing: Jan-Janice!
Ross Geller: Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
Chandler Bing: Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
Janice Litman Goralnik: It's you. This is yours.
Chandler Bing: What?!
Janice Litman Goralnik: Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
Chandler Bing: That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
