Joey Tribbiani: You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Monica Geller: We're so sorry.
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Chandler Bing: No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Chandler Bing: Oh-I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Monica Geller: Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Joey Tribbiani: All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
