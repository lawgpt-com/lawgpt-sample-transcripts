Ross Geller: Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Rachel Green: Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Rachel Green: As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Phoebe Buffay: If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Rachel Green: So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Monica Geller: Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Rachel Green: No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Ross Geller: Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Rachel Green: No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
