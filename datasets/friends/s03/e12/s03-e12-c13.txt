Monica Geller: So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Julio (poet): What?
Monica Geller: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Julio (poet): Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Monica Geller: You don't even know me...
Julio (poet): Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Monica Geller: What?
Julio (poet): The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Monica Geller: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Julio (poet): No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Monica Geller: Oh yeah.
