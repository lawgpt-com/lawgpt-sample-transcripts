Monica Geller: Hi guys!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: What are you up too?
Chandler Bing: Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, Big Brother.
Monica Geller: Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Monica Geller: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Chandler Bing: Eh...
Monica Geller: Okay well that's good to know.
