Bobby Corso: Hi Dina. Good to see you.
Rachel Green: Joey, what are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani: Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Rachel Green: Oh Joey this is crazy!
Joey Tribbiani: Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...
Dina: No!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh you'll take 'em!
Dina: No I won't!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! You don't get a say in this!
Dina: Yes I do!
Joey Tribbiani: Ahhh! I heard "I do", we're halfway there! Okay! You!
Rachel Green: All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
Bobby Corso: Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Joey Tribbiani: Well what am I supposed to do?
Rachel Green: You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Joey Tribbiani: No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Rachel Green: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Bobby Corso: Yeah...we kinda didn't use any...
Rachel Green: Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
