Monica Geller: Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
Joey Tribbiani: It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Chandler Bing: So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Joey Tribbiani: I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Rachel Green: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Ross Geller: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Ross Geller: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
Joey Tribbiani: See, now it's weird again.
Chandler Bing: I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Rachel Green: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Ross Geller: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
