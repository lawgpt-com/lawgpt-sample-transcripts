Ross Geller: Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Ben Geller: Cool!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Monica Geller: Come on Ben.
Ross Geller: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler Bing: Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben Geller: Santa!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Ross Geller: What are you doing here, Santa?
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Ross Geller: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Ross Geller: What are you doing?
Chandler Bing: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross Geller: Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Chandler Bing: Why?
Ross Geller: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Chandler Bing: But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross Geller: I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Chandler Bing: Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Monica Geller: Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Chandler Bing: Santa? Really?
Monica Geller: Yeah, is that okay?
Chandler Bing: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica Geller: No.
Chandler Bing: Then it's okaaay!
