The A.D: Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
The A.D: You.
Joey Tribbiani: Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
The A.D: You?
Joey Tribbiani: No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
The A.D: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
The A.D: There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Joey Tribbiani: Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
The A.D: The one with "Heston" on it.
Joey Tribbiani: Interesting.
