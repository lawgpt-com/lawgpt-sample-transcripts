Phoebe Buffay: I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Ross Geller: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Monica Geller: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Ross Geller: Gimme this.
Rachel Green: Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Monica Geller: Brides magazines?
Rachel Green: Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Monica Geller: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Rachel Green: Oh my God.
Monica Geller: I know. I need more pie.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Rachel Green: You didn't break up with that fireman?
Phoebe Buffay: No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Rachel Green: Wow!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Monica Geller: So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
