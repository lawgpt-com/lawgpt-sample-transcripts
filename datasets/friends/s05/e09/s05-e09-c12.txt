Joey Tribbiani: Thank you!
Chandler Bing: Joey's a sex addict.
Joey Tribbiani: What?!! No I'm not!!
Monica Geller: It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Joey Tribbiani: No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Monica Geller: Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Joey Tribbiani: No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Rachel Green: Well, what is the truth?
Ross Geller: Yeah, what's going on?
Phoebe Buffay: What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani: I slept with Monica.
Chandler Bing: Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Monica Geller: Oh no!
Ross Geller: You slept with my sister?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Ross Geller: This is not good for my rage.
Rachel Green: Monica, is this true?
Joey Tribbiani: Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Monica Geller: Yes it's true.
Rachel Green: Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Joey Tribbiani: Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Monica Geller: I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Ross Geller: My God Monica!!
Chandler Bing: Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Joey Tribbiani: No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Phoebe Buffay: So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Joey Tribbiani: That makes sense!
Rachel Green: And the video camera?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, Monica?
Monica Geller: I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: But sadly I could not be enticed.
Ross Geller: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Monica Geller: I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
