Monica Geller: Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Joey Tribbiani: Ohh, Nothing.
Monica Geller: Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Joey Tribbiani: I know what it did! Nothing.
Monica Geller: They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Joey Tribbiani: Like this.
Rachel Green: Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Joey Tribbiani: Sure! It flushes it.
Rachel Green: Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Chandler Bing: Hello!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Ah!!
Rachel Green: Guess who we ran into today?!

Chandler Bing: Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Phoebe Buffay: What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Joey Tribbiani: So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Chandler Bing: Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Rachel Green: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Chandler Bing: Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
