Rachel Green: Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Joey Tribbiani: Great! Roomie!
Rachel Green: Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Rachel Green: I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Joey Tribbiani: Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Rachel Green: That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Rachel Green: You're jokin' right?
Joey Tribbiani: Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
