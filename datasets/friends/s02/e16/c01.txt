Joey Tribbiani: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Chandler Bing: That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Chandler Bing: Waaa-aaah.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, so.
Chandler Bing: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Chandler Bing: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Chandler Bing: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
