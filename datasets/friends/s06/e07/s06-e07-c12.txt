Janine Lecroix: Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Janine Lecroix: Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Joey Tribbiani: Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Janine Lecroix: Is there something wrong?
Joey Tribbiani: All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Janine Lecroix: Joey...
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Janine Lecroix: Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh!
Janine Lecroix: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine Lecroix: I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I do. How you doin?
Janine Lecroix: I'm OK
Joey Tribbiani: What?!?!
Janine Lecroix: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh dear God!
