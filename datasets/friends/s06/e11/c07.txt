Joey Tribbiani: No-no, she really is sick!
Chandler Bing: Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Monica Geller: Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Joey Tribbiani: Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.

Joey Tribbiani: Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Monica Geller: What?!! What?
Chandler Bing: So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Monica Geller: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Chandler Bing: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Joey Tribbiani: I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Chandler Bing: No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Joey Tribbiani: I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Chandler Bing: Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
