Monica Geller: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Rachel Green: Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God!
Monica Geller: Oh, no!
Rachel Green: No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Ross Geller: So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Rachel Green: So?
Ross Geller: So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Monica Geller: Emily's straight.
Ross Geller: Oh, wake up!
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Ross Geller: Excuse me?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Ross Geller: Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Rachel Green: Huh.
Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Monica Geller: This totally makes sense!
Ross Geller: It does not!
Monica Geller: Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Phoebe Buffay: All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Rachel Green: Absolutely! Absolutely!
Monica Geller: This is so much fun!
Ross Geller: This is not fun!
Monica Geller: Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Ross Geller: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Rachel Green: What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
