Rachel Green: Anything?
Ross Geller: No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Phoebe Buffay: You told them he was missing?
Ross Geller: No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
Rachel Green: All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
Ross Geller: No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Rachel Green: Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Ross Geller: Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Rachel Green: All right, well how much time do you need?
Ross Geller: Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Rachel Green: One hour.
Ross Geller: Give me two.
Rachel Green: Then why do you ask?!

Ross Geller: Okay, wish me luck.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. I'm going with you.
Ross Geller: Why?!
Phoebe Buffay: Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Rachel Green: All right, I'll see you guys later.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Rachel Green: I'll figure something out.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. Good luck.
Rachel Green: Thanks.

Monica Geller: Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Rachel Green: Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Monica Geller: About what?
Rachel Green: Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Monica Geller: Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Rachel Green: No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Monica Geller: Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Rachel Green: Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Monica Geller: Rachel! You okay?
