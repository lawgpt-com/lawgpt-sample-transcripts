Joey Tribbiani: I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Ross Geller: Hello.
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Ross Geller: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Ross Geller: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Chandler Bing: It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Ross Geller: Then be supportive like a guy.
Chandler Bing: If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
