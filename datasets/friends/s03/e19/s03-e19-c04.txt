Phoebe Buffay: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Rachel Green: I know.
Phoebe Buffay: What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Rachel Green: Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Phoebe Buffay: Huh.

Rachel Green: I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Rachel Green: I don't have any issues with my Father.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
