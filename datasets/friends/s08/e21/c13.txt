Chandler Bing: ...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
The Interviewer: You must've had your hands full.
Chandler Bing: That I did. That I did.
The Interviewer: So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
Chandler Bing: My duties? All right.
The Interviewer: Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
Chandler Bing: I see.
The Interviewer: But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Chandler Bing: Good to know.
The Interviewer: We can go into detail...
Chandler Bing: No don't I beg of you!
The Interviewer: All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
Chandler Bing: Really?!
The Interviewer: Absolutely. You can relax; you did great.
Chandler Bing: Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
The Interviewer: Poo?
Chandler Bing: Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
The Interviewer: Poo?!
Chandler Bing: I'll look forward to your call.
