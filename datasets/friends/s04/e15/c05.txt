Monica Geller: Done?
Phoebe Buffay: Yep!
Rachel Green: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! What's up?
Monica Geller: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Joey Tribbiani: I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Rachel Green: Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Monica Geller: Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Rachel Green: It's coming from Joey!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
