Monica Geller: Ahhhhhhhh!
Chandler Bing: What's wrong?
Monica Geller: Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
Chandler Bing: Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Monica Geller: Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Chandler Bing: Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining.
Monica Geller: I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
Chandler Bing: Why not?
Monica Geller: Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Chandler Bing: Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Monica Geller: Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.
Chandler Bing: You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Monica Geller: Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
