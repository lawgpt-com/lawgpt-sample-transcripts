Chandler Bing: Hey.
Monica Geller: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Phoebe Buffay: Ahh.
Rachel Green: OK, ready when you are.
Phoebe Buffay: Okey-doke.
Monica Geller: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Chandler Bing: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Rachel Green: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Chandler Bing: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Joey Tribbiani: So where you gettin' it?
Phoebe Buffay: I think on my shoulder.
Ross Geller: What? What's on your shoulder?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Ross Geller: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Rachel Green: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Ross Geller: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Monica Geller: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Chandler Bing: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Monica Geller: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Monica Geller: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Phoebe Buffay: No, I think you should tell them.
Monica Geller: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Ross Geller: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
