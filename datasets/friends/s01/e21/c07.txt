Joey Tribbiani: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Chandler Bing: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Ross Geller: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Joey Tribbiani: Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross Geller: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Joey Tribbiani: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler Bing: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross Geller: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.

Phoebe Buffay: Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Did you call the cops?
Rachel Green: Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler Bing: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross Geller: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Monica Geller: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Ross Geller: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Chandler Bing: ...Take off their hats!
Phoebe Buffay: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
