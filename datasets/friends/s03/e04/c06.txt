Rachel Green: Honey, this will help.
Chandler Bing: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Monica Geller: Uff.
Monica Geller: That is never good.
Chandler Bing: Then I got all needy and clingy.
Rachel Green: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Chandler Bing: She said she'd call me.
Monica Geller: Ohh!
Chandler Bing: Oh God.
Monica Geller: Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Chandler Bing: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Rachel Green: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Monica Geller: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Rachel Green: Yeah, you do.
Chandler Bing: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Monica Geller: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Chandler Bing: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Monica Geller: Nooo!
Rachel Green: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Monica Geller: She has to know that your not ready.
Rachel Green: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Chandler Bing: So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Rachel Green: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Chandler Bing: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Rachel Green: Oh.
