Joey Tribbiani: And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Rachel Green: I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Rachel Green: What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Joey Tribbiani: Really?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: What award are you practicing for?
Rachel Green: Grammy, Best New Artist.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Rachel Green: Ohh that's great!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Rachel Green: So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Joey Tribbiani: What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?

Rachel Green: Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Rachel Green: Y'know?
Joey Tribbiani: You practice losing the Grammies too?
Rachel Green: Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah.
