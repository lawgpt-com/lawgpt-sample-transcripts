Ross Geller: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Rachel Green: No luck huh?
Ross Geller: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Rachel Green: Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Ross Geller: What're you doing?
Rachel Green: Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Ross Geller: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Rachel Green: Ok.
Ross Geller: Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Rachel Green: This is how I would hold a football.
Ross Geller: Ok, here, here. There we go.
Rachel Green: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
Ross Geller: It's alright, it's no big deal.
Rachel Green: Really?
Ross Geller: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: You think about stuff like that?
Ross Geller: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Rachel Green: Two, two babies?
Ross Geller: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Rachel Green: Then what's gonna happen?
Ross Geller: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Rachel Green: Uh-huh.
Ross Geller: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Rachel Green: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Ross Geller: Huh?
Rachel Green: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
