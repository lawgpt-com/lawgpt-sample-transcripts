Rachel Green: Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Chandler Bing: Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Rachel Green: Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller: What's the big deal?
Chandler Bing: I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.

Rachel Green: How about you guys?
Phoebe Buffay: Open bar?
Rachel Green: I think so.
Phoebe Buffay: I can do that for the kids.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Chandler Bing: Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Have a benefit.
Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Ross Geller: Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Chandler Bing: Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Ross Geller: I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Monica Geller: Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Chandler Bing: Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Monica Geller: Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Ross Geller: I don't know.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Ross Geller: Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
#ALL#: Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Ross Geller: Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Joey Tribbiani: That's not what she said last night.
Rachel Green: See? Now, he could date her.
