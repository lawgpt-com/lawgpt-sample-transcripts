Ross Geller: Okay, well the ??? is not home.
Rachel Green: No. Uch.
Ross Geller: Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Rachel Green: Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
Ross Geller: I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
Rachel Green: What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Ross Geller: Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Rachel Green: Oh my god, I left the water running.
Ross Geller: Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Rachel Green: Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Ross Geller: You never cooked since 1996.
Rachel Green: Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Ross Geller: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ... listen, listen!
Rachel Green: Ubb.
Ross Geller: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Rachel Green: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
