Laura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
Monica Geller: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Laura: Thank you!
Monica Geller: Would you like something to drink?
Laura: Oh, water would be fine.
Monica Geller: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Chandler Bing: Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Laura: Your place is just lovely.
Monica Geller: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Laura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
Monica Geller: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
Chandler Bing: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Laura: Oh...
Chandler Bing: What?
Laura: I just realized why I remember this place.
Monica Geller: Really? What is it?
Laura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
Monica Geller: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Laura: Yes!
Chandler Bing: Of course it was!
Laura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
Chandler Bing: RAT BASTARD!
Laura: So you're not friends with him?
Chandler Bing: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
Laura: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
Joey Tribbiani: Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
Laura: What was that?
Chandler Bing: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
