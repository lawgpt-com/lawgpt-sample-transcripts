Phoebe Buffay: .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Mike Hannigan: But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Phoebe Buffay: yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Mike Hannigan: that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Phoebe Buffay: I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Mike Hannigan: I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Mike Hannigan: and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
Phoebe Buffay: ok I can't do this.
Mike Hannigan: what's wrong?
Phoebe Buffay: well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me.
Mike Hannigan: uh huh.
Phoebe Buffay: so you don't think I'm a total freak.
Mike Hannigan: No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
Phoebe Buffay: I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Mike Hannigan: Definitely.
Ross Geller: This is Vicrum.
