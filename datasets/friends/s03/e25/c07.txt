Bonnie: Hey, what happened to you?
Rachel Green: Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Bonnie: Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Rachel Green: Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Bonnie: Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Rachel Green: Ohh-ha-ha!
Bonnie: I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Rachel Green: Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Bonnie: Really?!
Rachel Green: Ohh!
Bonnie: Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Rachel Green: Really?!
Bonnie: Yeah!
Rachel Green: I mean you definitely should do that.
Bonnie: Y'know what, I should do it.
Rachel Green: Yeah!
Bonnie: Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
