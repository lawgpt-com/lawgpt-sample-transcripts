Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Rachel Green: Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Phoebe Buffay: Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Ross Geller: I think it means he freaked out and left!
Phoebe Buffay: Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Rachel Green: Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Ross Geller: Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Rachel Green: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
