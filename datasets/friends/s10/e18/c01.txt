Gate Attendant #1: Madame, your passport please?
Rachel Green: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Gate Attendant #1: Your boarding pass, please.
Rachel Green: Oh.
Rachel Green: Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Gate Attendant #1: Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
Rachel Green: I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Gate Attendant #1: Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
Rachel Green: Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
