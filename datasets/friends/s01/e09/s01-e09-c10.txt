Rachel Green: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Monica Geller: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Rachel Green: We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica Geller: No I don't.
Rachel Green: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Monica Geller: No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Rachel Green: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Chandler Bing: Do either of you have the keys?
Monica Geller: The oven is on.
Rachel Green: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Joey Tribbiani: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Monica Geller: Well then get it, get it!
Joey Tribbiani: That tone will not make me go any faster.
Monica Geller: Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: That one will.
