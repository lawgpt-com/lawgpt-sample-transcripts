Monica Geller: What?! What are you doing?!
Chandler Bing: Do you know what just happened?
Monica Geller: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Chandler Bing: No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Monica Geller: Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Chandler Bing: Monica?
Monica Geller: What?!
Chandler Bing: I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Monica Geller: Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: Give me the good stuff.
Chandler Bing: Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Monica Geller: Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
