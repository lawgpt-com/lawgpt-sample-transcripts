Emily Waltham: So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ross Geller: Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Emily Waltham: Yeah, they're fine.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Emily Waltham: If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Ross Geller: Sure. Why not?
Emily Waltham: Really?
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Emily Waltham: I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Ross Geller: Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
Emily Waltham: Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
Ross Geller: Yeah sure.
Emily Waltham: Earl Grey?
Ross Geller: Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
