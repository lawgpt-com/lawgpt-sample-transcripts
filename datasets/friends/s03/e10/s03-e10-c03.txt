Joey Tribbiani: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Phoebe Buffay: Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Joey Tribbiani: What? Me having a job?
Phoebe Buffay: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Phoebe Buffay: Really?

Gunther: ...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Rachel Green: Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
Gunther: What if you put them here.
Rachel Green: Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Gunther: They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Rachel Green: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
Gunther: It's all right. Sweetheart.
