Rachel Green: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
Prospective Nanny: I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better.
Rachel Green: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
Prospective Nanny: Not really.
Rachel Green: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Ross Geller: Thank you.
Rachel Green: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Prospective Nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing?
Ross Geller: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Prospective Nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
Rachel Green: Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross Geller: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Rachel Green: What, the blonde with no bra?
Ross Geller: She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Rachel Green: Okay...
Sandy: Hi... I'm Sandy.
Ross Geller: And she's a little mannish...
