Rachel Green: Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Tag Jones: Yes, at 4:00.
Rachel Green: Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Tag Jones: I'd better get back to my desk.
Rachel Green: Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Tag Jones: My what?
Rachel Green: Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Tag Jones: Are you serious?
Rachel Green: No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
