Phoebe Buffay: Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Bob: Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Bob: Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Phoebe Buffay: That chick can't handle my corner.
Bob: Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Phoebe Buffay: Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
