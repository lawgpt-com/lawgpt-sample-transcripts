P R O C E E D I N G S

THE COURT:

All right, good morning.

3

Judge Drain.

4

for the October Omnibus hearing.

5

hearing, and I am happy to go down it in order.

6

This is

We are here in In re Purdue Pharma L.P., et al
I have the agenda for this

I will note that I’m a little late getting on the

7

bench because I have received and reviewed District Judge

8

McMahon’s memorandum and order denying without prejudice the

9

United States Trustee’s emergency motion for a stay pending

10

appeal.

The agenda includes at the end of the calendar a

11

pre-hearing conference on this Court’s determination of the

12

U.S. Trustee’s motion for a stay pending appeal and other

13

similar motions.

14

So, again, I’m going to go down the agenda in the

15

order of the agenda.

16

is a motion -- I’m deeming it a motion as the Debtor’s did

17

by filing a notice, and a notice of opposed order resolving

18

it, of Emanuel Thirkill.

19

All right.

20
21

And the first matter on the calendar

Is Mr. Thirkill on the phone?

No.

I don’t know who is handling this from the
Debtor’s side.

22

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, good morning.

23

record, Marshall Huebner of Davis Polk.

24

first matter is being held by Ms. Esther Townes.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

For the

MR. HUEBNER:

THE COURT:

MS. TOWNES:

4

THE COURT:

5

MS. TOWNES:

I’ll turn the podium over to her.
I see Ms. Townes on the screen.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Good morning.
For the record, this is Esther Townes

6

with Davis Polk & Wardwell on behalf of the Debtor.

7

hear me clearly?

8

THE COURT:

9

MS. TOWNES:

Yes, I can.

Can you

Thanks.

So Mr. Thirkill’s late claim motion

10

is at Docket Number 3764.

11

Thirkill’s motion, the Debtor (indiscernible) granting his

12

request (indiscernible) Pioneer factors.

13

Debtor has consulted with the UCC and the Ad Hoc Group

14

(indiscernible) individual victims regarding

15

(indiscernible).

16
17

And based on (indiscernible) Mr.

In addition, the

So on that basis, the Debtors (indiscernible) at
Docket Number 3901.

18

THE COURT:

And that (indiscernible).
Okay.

You were cutting in and out a

19

little bit, Ms. Townes.

20

that the Debtors consent to the motion for relief to file a

21

late claim under Bankruptcy Rule 9006 and the case law

22

interpreting it.

23

notice of their proposed order on October 6th, which would

24

grant the motion without prejudice of course to any party’s

25

rights with regard to the underlying merits of the claim.

212-267-6868

But I think the record is clear

And, in fact, the Debtors then provided

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 31
1

That notice is unopposed, and the Debtors have also

2

represented that the Official Unsecured Creditors’ Committee

3

does not oppose the granting of the motion.

4

else have anything to say on this motion?

5

I will grant the motion.

Does anyone
Okay.

The standard to permit a

6

late claim to be filed under Bankruptcy Rule 9006 and the

7

case law interpreting it, including Pioneer Investment

8

Services Company v. Brunswick Associates Limited

9

Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993) and In re Enron Corp.,

10

419 F.3d 115, 122 (2d Cir. 2005) is a fairly exacting one,

11

particularly with regard to Circuit has described as the

12

most important factor to consider, which is whether the

13

filing of the late claim in a timely manner was within the

14

reasonable control of the movant, i.e. the excuse for the

15

late filing.

16

The scrutiny paid to request to file late claims

17

is heightened when there has been a lengthy delay between

18

the bar date and the request to file a late claim and also

19

where a plan in reliance on in part the claims that were

20

timely filed has been negotiated and confirmed.

21

those facts apply here, as does the fact that there was

22

substantially extended notice of the bar date, particularly

23

for personal injury claims.

Both of

24

Nevertheless, Mr. Thirkill asserts that he was

25

subject to COVID-19 restrictions as well as confinement.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 32
1

And I think the Debtors could reasonably infer because of

2

that, his filing a late claim was outside of his reasonable

3

control.

4

In any event, the focus will be on the merits of

5

the claim, which is fully preserved and not on this issue,

6

which would have cost a fair amount of money to resolve as

7

far as whether it was within or not within his control.

8
9
10

So you can email the order granting the motion and
reserving all other rights to chambers and it will be
entered.

11

MS. TOWNES:

12

THE COURT:

Will do, Your Honor.
Okay.

Thank you.

The next matter on the calendar

13

is a motion that actually does not seek specifically leave

14

to file a late claim under Bankruptcy Rule 9006 and Pioneer

15

and Enron but has been taken by the Court to seek that

16

relief given that the movant, Howard Adelglass, has not

17

filed a timely claim.

18

September 23, 2021 seeks to have a claim considered against

19

the Debtors.

20

And in a letter to the Court dated

So I see Mr. Adelglass on the screen.

This motion

21

was objected to by the Debtors.

Mr. Adelglass, I don’t know if you have anything more to say

23

on the request to file the claim late.

24

MR. ADELGLASS:
targeted by Purdue.

212-267-6868

I have reviewed it.

But,

Well, I am a doctor, and I was

And I didn’t find out about McKinsey’s

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 33

involvement with Purdue until a few weeks ago.

2

basically because of my targeting by Purdue, it caused me --

3

I write opioids.

4

propaganda.

writing prescriptions for patients that lost their doctors.

A number of patients lost their doctors because they were

7

arrested.

I basically -- my life is over because of this whole thing.

9
10

I am a doctor.

I bought all their

And then I was arrested for doing my job and

And when I took them on, I got arrested.

THE COURT:

And so

When did that happen, Dr. Adelglass?

When were you arrested?

11

MR. ADELGLASS:

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. ADELGLASS:

14

THE COURT:

15

And

November 18th.

Of this year?
Yes.

Well, because your letter is dated

September 23, 2021.

16

MR. ADELGLASS:

Right.

Basically I didn’t

17

understand how McKinsey was involved with this.

18

read the article in Times that they admitted that they

19

helped Purdue target doctors by basically propaganda and

20

making the doctors give more -- write more prescriptions to

21

Purdue and make Purdue more profitable.

22

out about a month ago.

23

THE COURT:

And when I

I only found that

When did you first understand that you

were under investigation?

25

MR. ADELGLASS:

212-267-6868

I basically -- in 2018 they took

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 34
1

my files from my office.

2

at that time, they said I’m just a person of interest and

3

I’m not under -- there is no investigation started.

4

what I was told.

5

were in my -- the FBI, DA, everyone was in my apartment.

6
7

That’s

And then one day I woke up and the police

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Do you have

anything more to say on the motion?

8
9

But when I spoke to my attorneys

MR. ADELGLASS:

Just that, you know, the

oxycontin, the labeling that says it’s not addictive, all

10

the propaganda used to make me want to prescribe this.

11

the other doctors are in the same situation as me.

12

basically took on a number of patients that were on high

13

dose opioids when their doctors were arrested, and they were

14

going into withdrawal and suffering.

15

then I got arrested.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. ADELGLASS:

18

THE COURT:

I took them on, and

And when did you take them on?
2018, right before I was -- right

Okay, all right.

Very well.

All

right.

22

I

before they came to my office and took my files.

19
20

And

I have reviewed the Debtor’s objection as well,
but I’m happy to hear from the Debtor’s counsel on this.

MR. MCCLAMMY:

MR. MCCLAMMY:

Thank you.

Your Honor, we do stand

on our papers.

history of how things transpired that Dr. Adelglass has set

5

up here.

6

the Debtor’s position with respect to how we are going about

7

addressing the merits of claims such as those.

8
9

I will not respond to the statement of the

I think the record of these cases is clear as to

I will say, however, that this presentation and
this motion, to the extent it can be construed as a motion,

10

is very different from the others that we’ve seen.

11

appears to us, having heard argument today, that the

12

allegations do relate back to a pre-petition hearing, that

13

Dr. Adelglass was well aware of his connections with Purdue

14

and, you know, potential claims against Purdue.

15

It

As Your Honor has noted, the notice of the

16

pendency of these cases and the bar date has been extensive

17

and perhaps even unprecedented.

18

set out in either the motion papers or the presentation

19

today to argue for excusable neglect or delay here.

20

prejudice we think would be immense in these cases if we

21

were to start to open the floodgates to prescribers just

22

coming out now and, you know, without any explanation of the

23

reasons for the delay.

24
25

And we do not see any basis

And the

So for the reasons set forth in the papers and
just now, we would respectfully request that this motion be

THE COURT:
to say on the motion?

4

Okay.

Does anyone else have anything

All right.

I have before me what I deem to be a motion.

It’s

5

dated September 23, 2021.

I will note that it was preceded

6

by a September 2, 2021 letter to the Court that really did

not seek any specific relief.

around the 23rd.

The Supreme Court interpreted such a request in

22

Pioneer Investment Services Company v. Brunswick Associates

23

Limited Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993) and there noted

24

that the determination of excusable neglect is an equitable

25

one considering all the circumstances, including “One, the

danger of prejudice to the Debtor; two, the length of the

2

delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings;

3

three, the reason for the delay, including whether it was

4

within the reasonable control of the movant; and four,

5

whether the movant acted in good faith,” id at 395.

6

The Second Circuit in applying that test has noted

7

that it takes a hard line with respect to the test because

8

the equities will rarely if ever favor a party who fails to

9

follow the clear dictates of a court rule, or in this case,

10

a court order setting a time limit.

And that’s where the

11

rule is entirely clear.

12

excusable neglect will in the ordinary course lose under the

13

Pioneer test, In re Enron Corp., 419 F.3d 115, 122-23 (2d.

14

Cir. 2005).

15

where no excuse for the claim being filed late or an

16

unreasonable excuse for the claim being filed late is

17

asserted.

18

the Pioneer case generally then apply where there are closed

19

questions.

Courts expect that a party claiming

22

F.3d 199, (3d Cir. 2000).

23

basis for why the claim was filed several months late, and

24

it appears to me based on the movant’s statements at oral

25

argument that he was aware or reasonably aware of the

Here, the letter itself stated no

alleged basis for his claim as far back as 2018.

Even his

2

acknowledgment that he was under investigation at least at

3

that time for the improper prescription of oxycontin and

4

that he had taken over, according to him, patients who had

5

previously been treated by doctors who were either under

6

investigation or themselves had been arrested for the

7

improper prescription of oxycontin, which to my mind would

8

have put him on notice as to his current theory that he was

9

misled by the Debtors to prescribe the drug.

10

So the primary factor not being established under

11

the Pioneer test, namely whether the delay had some form or

12

excuse or not, that would be sufficient to deny the motion

13

here.

14

In addition, however, there have been several

months since the bar date was established.

premised upon complex interlocking settlements among

21

others, that allocate the Debtor’s value among those

And as I understand it, a further amended

The rubric under which Mr. Bass seeks this relief

7

is Bankruptcy Rule 7019, which provides that Federal Rule of

Civil Procedure 19 applies in adversary proceedings except

that if an entity joined as a party raises the defense that

Rule 19 of the Federal

The objections to the applicability of Bankruptcy

16

Rule 7019 here are twofold.

17

7019 does not apply because these cases and Mr. Bass’ claims

18

in these cases, and he filed proofs of claim timely, are not

adversary proceedings as specified in the rule.

20

First, they assert that Rule

Bankruptcy Rule 9014(c), which incorporates

21

specific Part 7 rules of the Bankruptcy Rules, does not

22

incorporate Rule 7019, leaving it up to the court whether it

23

wishes to do so in the particular facts and circumstances.

24
25

Secondly, the objections contend, as recognized by
Rule 7019 they can, that the court lacks subject matter

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 45
1

jurisdiction over the causes of action asserted in the New

2

Jersey court complaint against the non-debtor parties.

3

of course the causes of action against the debtor parties

4

are stayed and will be governed by the Chapter 11 plan.

5

And

Both of those objections are meritorious and would

6

require the denial of the motion.

There is really no

7

procedural basis to consolidate and jointly administer

8

either of the Debtor’s cases or the Bass claims in these

9

cases with the litigation pending in New Jersey, which

10

raises totally if issues unrelated to the claims against

11

these debtors except only in terms of the potential for

12

providing some context for the assertions in the third

13

proposed amended complaint.

14

In addition, the Court would not have jurisdiction

15

over those causes of action, i.e. the causes of action in

16

the New Jersey court against the non-debtor parties which

17

are not covered under 28 U.S.C. 1334.

really is no basis for such an injunction either in terms of

upon the Court’s consideration of the complaint that has

been filed, it would appear that there would be no

likelihood of success on the merits with respect to such an

22

injunction in any event given what I’ve already identified

23

as a fatal flaw in the complaint, which is an assertion that

MS. EITEL:

Good morning, Your Honor.

This is Nan

8

Eitel for the United States Trustee, appearing for the U.S.

9

Trustee.

10

THE COURT:

Good morning.

11

MS. EITEL:

First, Your Honor, Section 158(d)

12

provides four independent criteria warranting certification

13

of a directed review and appeal to the circuit court.

14

although the U.S. Trustee satisfies all four of those gates,

15

it need only satisfy one.

16

certification for direct review is mandatory and there is no

17

discretion.

And

And if one is satisfied,

18

I think it’s important to note that the merits of

19

the United States Trustee’s appeal are not before the Court

20

today and the Court need not find that the appeal itself

21

would be meritorious, though of course we believe that it

22

should be.

23

Second, Your Honor, before turning to the argument

24

on the four criteria and why each is satisfied here, it’s

25

important to note how puzzling the Debtor’s opposition is to

212-267-6868

the Debtors have said for two years about the need for

It seems at odds with everything that

Second Circuit, we need only compare or contrast the

10

Debtor’s statements on this issue to conclude the Second

11

Circuit has not squarely addressed the issues presented by

12

this appeal.

13

In the opposition, the Debtor said, “Third party

14

release in bankruptcy and the circumstances under which

15

those releases may be approved are issues that have been

16

settled in the circuit for decades.”

17

In contrast, on June 16th, Debtors and other

18

opponents wrote to Judge McMahon seeking a joint tribunal

19

for confirmation.

20

Third Circuit have recently held that bankruptcy courts may

21

issue a final order confirming a plan providing for third-

22

party releases,” and citing the cases, “The Second Circuit

23

has yet not squarely addressed these issues.”

24

go further than the Debtor’s admission in the June letter.

25

The Second Circuit has not squarely addressed the issues

Next, Your Honor, in discussion about what the

3

case law was within the Second Circuit, I think people were

4

shocked that the U.S. Trustee argued that Metromedia did not

5

hold anything about third party releases because it was

6

dismissed for equitable movements.

But at the end of the

10

day, it’s not a holding, it’s dicta.

Metromedia didn’t

11

answer or address the due process question presented here,

12

either.

13

With respect to due process, the Debtors

14

repeatedly refer to all of the notice and the publicity that

15

was given to provide due process with respect to this case.

16

But when they do that, they are wrongly conflating the issue

17

of due process with respect to Purdue’s creditors or their

18

claims against Purdue and their participation in Purdue’s

bankruptcy.

20

(indiscernible) process.

21

we don’t challenge the adequacy of the notice

The objection goes to great lengths to

The Debtor has also suggested that the United

2

releases.

3

itself and it’s cited and quoted in our motion papers where

4

it says, “Payment is only made for claims held against the

5

Debtors and not against non-debtor parties.”

6

But, Your Honor, that’s straight from the plan

Debtors do get one thing right about the UST

7

position on releases, that bankruptcy courts do not have the

8

power or the constitutional authority to impose non-

9

consensual releases of such claims of non-debtors versus

10

non-debtors.

11

The Debtor also says that we’re saying the courts

12

of appeals have been violating due process for decades.

13

would simply note that in a related context until the

14

Supreme Court decided Stern v. Marshall, bankruptcy courts

15

were routinely exceeding constitutional authority until one

16

litigant challenged that notion all the way to the Supreme

17

Court.

18

they are okay until they are not and decided by the Supreme

19

Court.

20

I

So it’s not unheard of for issues to be assumed that

Speaking of Stern, Your Honor, every opponent here

21

today previously wrote to Judge McMahon in that same June

22

16th letter asking for the reference to be withdrawn in two

23

discrete matters because there are stern issues related to

24

the third-party releases, which is also part of United

25

States Trustee’s appeal.

212-267-6868

I quote, “In order to eliminate

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 59
1

any doubt concerning the finality of any order confirming

2

the plan, the Debtors respectfully request that Your Honor

3

consider presiding as a joint tribunal only on two discrete

4

issues; the plan’s treatment of personal injury claimants

5

and the imposition of non-consensual third-party releases.”

6

This to me seems an admission of there is a

7

possible constitutional infirmity in this Court’s authority.

8

And again, that alone should warrant taking up appeal.

9

The Second Circuit, simply put, has not considered

10

the issue of due process.

11

or two of Supreme Court decisions on bankruptcy matters as

12

anything of an endorsement of expansive equitable powers or

13

creative solutions outside the lines.

16

practitioners were surprised to find the narrow view and the

narrow holding of the bankruptcy court’s authority and

power.

19

So the United States Trustee satisfies Matter 1.

20

It’s a legal question on which there is no Supreme Court

21

precedent and there is a division of opinions.

Moreover, Congress itself has not one, not two,

7

if the Second Circuit takes the case, they can keep my

And she said two things in particular.

She said

She had no concerns whatsoever with the

idea of putting in this work and having the case taken away.

THE COURT:

I guess the last point I raise is --

7

and this comes through strongly in the Weeber case.

The

8

Circuit has been clear -- and this is consistent with

9

jurisprudence generally and the structure of the federal

10

courts -- that the circuits benefit from the analysis of the

11

lower courts by the lower courts, particularly where there

12

is an extensive record.

13

tried scores of cases.

14

really well.

15

again, they have said Congress emphasized the importance of

16

our expeditious resolution of bankruptcy cases, but it did

17

not wish us to privilege speed over other goals.

18

speed is not necessarily compatible with our ultimate

19

objective.

20

cases involving unsettled areas of bankruptcy law reviewed

by the district court would be most helpful.

So ultimately here, although it’s two different

things -- there is the certification and then there is the

Mr. Edmunds, that I asked the U.S. Trustee’s counsel.

meaningful potential for delay by giving the circuit not

reasonable things to think about.

14

that Second Circuit motions panel can answer and has

15

discretion under Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Appellate

seriousness and all of the things that ride on the case and

the outcome, I think that that’s something that Second

in the case, do not represent the citizens and inhabitants

17

And those are parties that even the Debtor, the

Now, I understand that reasonable minds can differ

18

about whether that is the effect of Your Honor’s ruling.

19

But to say that these are not fair issues of dispute that

20

have not been raised by the parties and that will not have

21

to be decided through an appeal and that these are therefore

22

not matters of huge public importance, I don’t see how that

23

case can be made.

24
25

I will just briefly comment on what Mr. Edmunds
said before.

I think he’s right.

all the parties are bringing to bear that there is

6

relatively low chance that this case will slip between the

cracks and somehow not be addressed by those parties either

10

I believe that in a case of this magnitude, of

it is remote.

11

And so, Your Honor, we do echo the call that Your

Honor has to service the gatekeeper to certify that, yes,

13

this is a matter of public importance.

14

Court can decide the Weeber factors that Your Honor

15

mentioned about whether in a matter of public importance it

still would rather hear from a lower court or not, or it can

take those matters into consideration.

MR. GOLDMAN:

I just want to put some finer points

why we believe there is no controlling decision in the

Second Circuit on the questions of law that have been

20

presented.

21

decision where the parties’ and the Court’s focus has been

22

during this hearing.

23

And that takes me first to the Metromedia

I think we all understand that as defined by

24

Black’s Law Dictionary, a holding is a court’s determination

25

of a matter of law pivotal to its decision.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

It’s

516-608-2400

Page 87
1

interesting to note, on the other hand, what the Second

2

Circuit considers to be the highest order of dictum, and

3

that is judicial dictum, which is defined in U.S. v. Bell,

4

524 F.2d 206, as where a higher court is providing a

5

construction of law to guide the future conduct inferior

6

courts.

7

dictum is not binding on the court and therefore not binding

8

precedent.

9

discussion of non-consensual third-party releases is

And even in that situation, it held that judicial

So at most I think we can say that Metromedia’s

10

judicial dictum and therefore it is not a controlling

11

decision on non-consensual third-party release in general,

12

let alone when they’re used to release the police power

13

claims of state governments.

14

Even the dicta in Metromedia leaves wide open

15

questions on whether third-party releases are permissible.

16

For example, whoever decides or even provides guidance on

17

when a non-debtor release steps over the line into what it

18

calls (indiscernible) of the bankruptcy process.

19

And it’s significant that in the last paragraph of

20

its discussion about third-party releases, the Circuit

21

rejected the appellee’s argument because the appealing

22

creditors received distribution under the plan from the

23

third party.

24

debtor release.

25

creditor’s plan distribution was on account of their claims

212-267-6868

They had no right to complain about the nonAnd it reasoned that the appealing

Page 88

against the debtor, not on account of their claims against

2

the non-debtor.

3

so it is here the distributions the states are receiving on

4

account of their claims against Purdue, not the Sacklers.

5

And that question was left open in Metromedia expressly in

6

the last paragraph that I just mentioned.

7

That was at Page 143 of the decision.

And

I think it’s an even clearer case for

8

certification when you consider there is on Second Circuit

9

decision on the question of whether state governments can be

10

forced to release their police power claims against non-

11

debtor third parties via a third-party release.

12

At Page 141 of Your Honor’s modified bench ruling,

13

you recognized that for many of the governmental objectors’

14

causes of action against shareholder-released parties, the

15

police power exception would apply.

16

But in deciding that those claims could be taken

17

away involuntarily by the third-party release here, Your

18

Honor did not cite any controlling Second Circuit decisions,

19

but decisions from other jurisdictions that police power

20

claims can be enjoined and that Congress’s power under the

21

bankruptcy (indiscernible) of the Constitution overrides

22

police and regulatory power or state sovereignty.

23

simply no controlling Second Circuit decision on those

24

points of law, or certainly Your Honor would have cited

25

them.

There is

THE COURT:

Well, but Mr. Goldman, I think when

11

you read the cases applying 158(d)(2)(A)(i), they recognize,

would never be asking for a direct appeal in any event, if

combining holdings from multiple cases.

19

think in the appellate area on Stern v. Marshall.

20

just -- I think to define controlling law that narrowly

21

would again open the door in a way that neither the statute

22

nor the circuit has said it should be opened.

23

And that’s not how they
They define a controlling

Similarly, courts have said that it doesn’t

2

course that say that.

3

controlling precedent any less so.

4

I mean, I just think there are plenty of
Novel arguments do not make

So the statute has narrow exceptions for police

5

power.

And it just seems to me that to put it into

6

(d)(2)(A)(i) as opposed to maybe one of the other

7

provisions, maybe the last one, is going to open the door

8

where courts almost uniformly have closed it.

9

I mean, there has been litigation in the Second

10

Circuit over third-party releases and injunctions since the

11

1980s.

12

(indiscernible) came out to interpret the new provisions of

14

time the Bankruptcy Code is amended in a meaningful way.

you’re saying.

And I also understand I believe they will get to the Second

Circuit.

20

I understand these issues are important.

It’s just, again, whether it warrants a direct

MR. GOLDMAN:

I hear what you’re saying, Your

21

Honor, but I think that could leave us falling into the

22

public importance category given the proliferation of third-

23

party releases and the constitutionality after Sterns v.

24

Marshall.

25

I think there is also a compelling issue based on

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 91

the Jevic decision which holds that Section 105 can’t be

used when there is a (indiscernible) statutes such as 249,

3

which allows the court to dismiss a case and (indiscernible)

4

certain provisions for cause, which it held was not

5

sufficiently implemented in that case.

6

And here there is a similar issue with Sections

7

1123(a) and (b)(6).

They are very vague statutes, but they

8

are being relied upon here as a means to say that third-

9

party releases are permissible under the Code.

And I think

10

there is an equivalence there to what the Court held in

11

Jevic.

12

appeal is supported.

And so I think for that additional reason, a direct

13

I think, finally, I would just conclude with

14

observing that as the U.S. Trustee pointed out, the factor

15

settlement agreement mandates that the debtors would move

16

themselves to direct certification.

17

Debtors and the Sacklers considered any challenge to the

18

third-party release to be suitable for a direct appeal.

19

they’ve changed course now I would submit is perplexing and

20

they should be held to their position as stated in that

21

settlement agreement which Your Honor approved stating that

22

there would be no amendment notwithstanding anything to the

23

contrary.

to lower my volume here, Your Honor, because I hear that

25

I don’t know why.

The provision that I am interested in with regard
to 28 U.S.C. 158 is that the immediate appeal to the circuit

governmental entities.

5

virtually no time is going to be lot by pursuing this appeal

to the Circuit.

7

within this provision is “advance the progress of the case”.

8

And believe it or not, I actually believe that the direct

appeal has a basis to advance, materially advance the

Because as we sit here today,

There are some open issues I believe with regard

14

to this case and whether or not it may be consummated

15

raised in our papers, which is that the plan itself right

pending matter to a date after the appeal before the

18

later date when the circuit makes a decision, if that is

19

that path which Your Honor recommends and which the circuit

20

accepts.

21

I personally think that given the multi-party

22

dispute here and the likelihood that whatever the case may

23

be with regard to a district court decision, some party is

24

likely to take a higher appeal beyond the district court,

25

which is going to further delay that -- potentially further

in the sense that we are arguing here about delay when that

With regard to the other issue that I would like

7

to address, Your Honor, in terms of the -- in terms of the

8

Debtor’s arguments with regard to the Canadian first nations

9

and municipalities appeals, they have yet still -- they have

10

made multiple pleadings to cite a case that states that the

11

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not the exclusive path

12

for obtaining affirmative jurisdiction over a foreign

13

sovereign.

14

The Debtor has never effectively tried to suggest

15

that there is an exception to the Foreign Sovereign

16

Immunities Act that applies.

17

exceptions set forth in the statute.

18

significant case law about this.

19

what the Second Circuit’s position on all of this is, I

20

would say that the exclusive mechanism for obtaining

21

jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns is through the Foreign

22

Sovereign Immunities Act.

23

2

Now, at the outset of this, I said that there are

3

jurisdictional constitutional issues related to these

4

appeals.

5

from Kirschenbaum when read with reference to 1334 suggests

6

that there if in fact a subject matter jurisdictional issue

And I think that that suggests that that provision

question that 106 of the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to

arguable that it does not apply to foreign tribal

It's not actually our obligation to serve all of the

hundreds of thousands of parties individually for every

20

single motion.

21

actually someone else’s motion to which we are objecting.

22

And I just want to be clear, as an objector to someone

23

else’s motion, the motion that we have to tell every

24

claimant in the case about the motion is just not a burden

25

that could fairly be put on us.

who we don’t believe exist, which are people with claims

3

against the Sacklers who don’t have claims against Purdue.

4

And even if they did exist, those claims are not being

5

released under the plan.

6

But, Your Honor, here’s what was before Judge

McMahon, and then I’m going to move on from this very

quickly.

going to enter a bridge order, the United States Trustee

Despite knowing weeks ago that this Court was not

the district court’s scheduling conference, to hit us with

that total surprise 25-page emergency stay motion at the end

13

of the page limit, after Judge McMahon issued an order that

14

said no more letters because they had previously filed

15

letters seeking relief, which we took to mean no more

17

The only document before Judge McMahon at a

But, Mr. Huebner, we seem to be going

23

MR. HUEBNER:

I don’t know where

So, Your Honor, it’s headed to

2

already decided that these are pure legal issues.

3

that’s just completely false.

4

So let me just move on, Your Honor.

And

That was

5

actually all I was going to say, which is there was a

6

scheduling conference where they had papers that they

7

ambushed us with that nobody else had time to respond to.

8

And Judge McMahon, based only on that, expressed some views.

9

That’s not really relevant to today.

10
11

So let me just move right to the heart of the
matters.

12

Your Honor, Ms. Gold quite correctly began by

13

noting who was on the one side of this very important

14

contested matter.

15

was on the other side.

16

So let’s take a minute and talk about who

It has been confirmed to us that the Ad Hoc Group

18

19

20

support all the arguments (indiscernible) UCC.

21

So on our side of the V as it were, Your Honor,

22

you have the Debtors, the UCC, the AHC, which as you know,

23

represents multiples of the number of states of the

24

objectors and appellants as well as many others in the NDL

25

(indiscernible), the Multi-State Entities Group, the

that others are somehow claiming to speak for, the NAS Ad

3

Hoc Group, the pediatric victims that others are claiming to

4

speak for, the hospitals, the public schools, the third

5

party payers, and the rate payers.

6

And so on one side, Your Honor, we have every

7

organized group in the entire case who have voted

8

overwhelmingly in favor of the plan.

9

we have approximately one on-thousandth, a little bit more

And on the other side,

10

than that, of one percent of the creditors in this case,

11

about ten out of 614,000.

12

So, Your Honor, let’s just go right to the

13

statute.

14

And the most remarkable thing is that not one person cited

15

one case to you that actually addressed 158.

16

because every single case that has addressed 158 on each of

17

U.S. Trustee’s brand-new argument.

2

I’m not sure when it came to them, but obviously we will

deal with things as they arise, that somehow it’s

Trustee’s brief, as they’re just fighting yesterday’s war,

3

they allege that no controlling law exists because the

4

existing cases do not authorize “release of non-debtors’

5

direct claims of other non-debtors that are independent of

6

the debtor’s own claims and property.”

7

misperception or misrepresentation has no relevance because

8

there are no such totally independent claims released here.

9

That profound

Rather, Your Honor found expressly that that was

10

not the case.

11

12

13

bankruptcy estate.”

14

Those are the claims being released here.

15

What Madoff tells us is that “The touchstone

Madoff at Page 88, quoting Quigley.

Your Honor specifically limited the releases of

16

the Sacklers to claims for which the “conduct, omission, or

17

liability of a debtor is a legal cause of legally relevant

19

matter of fact that the release claims against the Sacklers

20

have a direct impact on the estates and their property.

21

And Your Honor as a trier of fact found as a

And thus, the bankruptcy

And, Your Honor, in the confirmation order at Page

30, you further found that the debtor’s continued

9

unavoidable involvement in potentially thousands of lawsuits

10

against the Sacklers that are clearly all about the debtor’s

11

prior alleged or actual misconduct -- they admitted to

12

multiple crimes -- unquestionably would implicate

13

(indiscernible) debtors.

14

So with their first argument that it’s not dicta,

15

I mean, they’re basically trying to overrule the Second

16

Circuit, which has made it clear multiple times that it is a

17

holding.

18

what case ever anywhere in the world has ever said that

19

Metromedia is dicta, the answer is none.

20

did they say in Metromedia that it was a holding, they did

21

it later in Madoff where they said, and I quote, “In In re

court rejected the movant’s attempt to artificially

and said, “There is no controlling decision addressing the

19

That’s not because the legal question

Again, I shouldn’t have to address any of this

because this is all an ambush and improper under a joinder,

4

but on a motion that already was moving on shortened time.

5

But for the avoidance of doubt, Your Honor, his foreign

sovereign immunities claims were exactly what agreed to

confirmation, and Your Honor dealt with them completely and

8

definitively.

9

exactly what it says on its face, which is that sovereign

11

I’m going to leave Mr. Underwood sort of, you know, riffing

on his joinder on that motion to shorten time at that.

13

Point three, Your Honor.

So

I only have to say the

14

sentence, but then I’m going to use a lot of case law.

15

Arguments that Metromedia was wrongly decided, and the

16

appellants believe it’s going to be overturned either by the

by many courts to not remotely trigger 158.

about the lack of controlling circuit decision.

20

about displeasure with circuit decisions.

21

doing is they’re expressing their displeasure that the law

22

in the Second Circuit and six other circuits is what it is.

23

And if some day they are granted cert, they are absolutely

24

welcome under our legal system to advance that argument to

25

the supreme court.

2

So let’s talk about that.

So first of all, let’s

3

just leave aside the audacity and hail Mary cubed aspect of

4

the appellants actually saying the Second Circuit got this

5

wrong five times, six other circuits got it wrong multiple

6

times, and that dozens of courts have been violating the

have figured that out.

10

Because even if they’re right, that
It’s a dead loser under 158.

So first let’s talk about -- and now I’m going to

11

tie back to the sort of attempted weaponization of Judge

McMahon, which I think was extremely inappropriate after the

21

11

Bench ruling at Page 113.
“Under the amended plan, it is now clear...that

12

only holders of claims against the debtors are being deemed

13

to grant the shareholder release, and it is equally clear

14

that...that holders of such claims receive due process

15

notice.”

16

Second, Your Honor.

If the movants were correct

17

in their claim that the third-party releases inherently and

18

forever violate due process because they’re always illegal,

19

that means that 50 courts, including seven courts of appeal

20

have all been violating the constitution.

21

Your Honor, for the avoidance of doubt, the due

22

process laws of the Fifth Amendment is 230 years old.

23

think it is a reasonable assumption that the seven circuits,

24

including the Second Circuit, knew about the existence of

25

the Constitution of the United States of America and the due

process clause as they ruled again and again that under

2

appropriate circumstances third-party releases are

3

appropriate.

4

Finally, Your Honor, Section 158’s requirement of

5

no controlling circuit precedence becomes both a farce and a

6

nullity if you can satisfy it by saying, well, there is

7

controlling precedent, but it’s wrong.

8

at all because all you have to do is say I think the circuit

9

10

THE COURT:

you heard a lot of oral argument, and you asked a lot of

2

Here, we had about a thousand pages of

3

declarations and days of trial that there could be no

4

restructuring without these releases in large part because

5

of the other dozens of intercreditor deals in which these

6

very movants insisted in Phase 1 mediation that there be a

So in our case, which probably had the most

11

it proved beyond (indiscernible) that the claims would,

that they failed to justify any conceivable effect on the

estate, the judge even said if you want to submit a modified

24

form of release that does come within Metromedia, go ahead.

25

You simply did it before the ruling and said if you don’t

2

So the notion that there is an intra-circuit dispute based

3

on the only two cases any party cites, both of which agree

4

with each other and actually reach very similar conclusions

5

in applying Metromedia to their facts is really shockingly

6

unsupported as a claim.

7

And then they were fixed.

Finally, Your Honor, there is the question of

8

whether a direct appeal will “materially advance the

9

progress of these cases”.

Here also, Your Honor, it’s

10

amazing to me that someone can get up and make a legal

argument to a court and not cite a single case where case

The U.S. Trustee basically admitted -- I think she

said it three times -- that there is a distinct possibly,

14

it’s very likely that Judge McMahon will already have ruled

15

before the Second Circuit even decides whether or not to

to make stuff up on the podium, but I think there’s a very

2

good argument that we actually get to the Second Circuit

3

faster if we actually have a normal appeal and it is ruled

4

on with extraordinary speed which Judge McMahon is being

5

remarkable about.

6

where we are.

7

And then we all go together if that’s

Look at the facts I gave you in GM, Your Honor.

8

It took them 83 days just to rule on direct certification.

9

They will already have well before them I would think based

10

on what Judge McMahon has said so far in appellate decision

11

-- and by the way, Your Honor, I’ll give you another great

12

answer which is totally different.

13

ground for appeal, which we actually think is frivolous, is

14

the Stern v. Marshall issue, which is that you need an

15

Article III judge and not an Article I judge.

16

One of the appellant’s

Here's another great reason.

Because skipping the

17

district court harmed the case grievously if that argument

18

is found to be meritorious.

19

finds that, they have to remand it for further proceedings.

20

If the District Court finds it under amending standing order

21

of reference, M10-468, S.D.N.Y 2012, they are actually

22

allowed, I think it’s a directive maybe, to treat any

23

rulings of this court as proposed findings about conclusions

24

of law.

25

and we don’t put stock in, that they’re actually right, then

212-267-6868

Because if the Second Circuit

And so actually if one of the arguments they love,

Page 132

it's a fact that we get resolved (indiscernible) the

So that’s just one of many reasons.

But again, Your Honor, the burden is not on the

And they have the burden of proving that these cases would

the circuit eventually, so why not go there first.

there is a reason that no case has ever allowed that,

point which, I stand correct, was raised in the last

paragraph of the state’s motion.

Trustee’s motion, about the Sackler settlement agreement --

MR. HUEBNER:

5

THE COURT:

6

I don’t think in the U.S.

-- and whether this litigation is

somehow a breach of that agreement.

7

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, the answer is, as

8

you might imagine, we are aware of what our settlement

9

agreement says.

10

So let me explain it as follows.

The agreement was obviously negotiated and was I

11

believe filed on the docket well before the confirmation

12

hearing was underway, and certainly well before Your Honor

13

issued a great amount of guidance during the hearing and

14

great amount of further guidance in connection with the

15

ruling, including at the ruling itself, including directing

16

us not to change it.

17

The ethos of that provision without any question

18

is in fact getting to an appeal because, frankly, we have

19

never had a problem with them.

20

sort of unstated untruth, that somehow we are desperately

21

trying to avoid a layer of appellate review.

because we made our views quite clear.

I think Mr. Huebner has covered

I think it’s important to respond, as Mr. Huebner
did, just to one or two points raised by the United States

Trustee.

2

At the outset of their argument, the United States

3

Trustee had argued that the Debtor’s position on

4

certification was puzzling since the Debtors and other

5

parties have previously stated that they are in favor of

6

moving these cases along.

7

one is more concerned with an expedited emergence and with

8

the desire to begin abating the opioid crisis than the Ad

9

Hoc Committee is.

10

And I want to be clear that no

But the reason why we oppose the motions is

11

because we have concluded, along with the Debtors and the

12

Committee, that going through the district court represents

13

the best chance and the fastest possible emergency while

14

also accommodating the desire for appellate review.

15

Your Honor mentioned at the September 30th hearing

16

that those two interests have to be balanced and that there

17

is a sweet spot that can be achieved between then.

18

think that going through the district court is the best way

19

to hit that sweet spot.

20

And we

I also wanted to just respond to the argument made

21

by the United States Trustee that the issues on appeal here

22

involve pure questions of law.

24

received briefing from the United States Trustee.

think that it’s clear from the case law, including

So I think unless the U.S. Trustee is suggesting

7

that they don’t actually disagree with the Court’s findings

8

under Metromedia, then the appeals obviously involve

9

questions of fact.

10

And I think with that, Your Honor, I won’t belabor

11

or repeat the points that Mr. Huebner did.

But for the

12

reasons he has stated today and set forth in our brief, we

13

would also urge the Court to deny the motions.

By agreement, Mr. Huebner argued most

if not all of the motion on behalf of the parties that are

www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 141

objecting to the motion.

I rise now only to address the

2

fourth point, which is whether the appeal will advance the

3

progress of the case, a point that you’ve been talking about

4

a little bit.

5

As Mr. Huebner stated and as the case law clearly

6

states -- for instance, see Johns Manville, 449 B.R. 34, if

7

this provision were to simply mean that bypassing the

8

district court and going to an appellate court would be

9

faster than having to go to the district court first, by

10

definition every case would be certified to the appellate

11

courts and there would never be any appeal to the district

12

court.

13

We talked about that.
But that’s of course not the case and not the

14

correct way to look at the statute.

15

pointed out and we point out in our papers, one must look at

16

the facts and circumstances and whether bypassing second

17

circuit would materially advance the progress of the case,

18

not the progress of the appeal.

19

in particular weigh heavily against direct certification.

20

Rather, as Mr. Huebner

And the facts of this case

Mr. Huebner already addressed the five or six most

21

important points here but let me just restate them before I

4

earlier.

5

And you’ve also talked about those

Third, there is a jurisdictional issue that the

6

Appellants have raised, and which Mr. Huebner mentioned,

7

which if they are successful at the Second Circuit, will

8

result in going back to the District Court to cure it and

9

then back up to the Second Circuit.

10
11

Fourth, sitting here today, we don’t know if the
Second Circuit would even accept certification.

12

Fifth, even if the Second Circuit accepts

13

certification, there is no assurance that they are going to

14

accept Judge McMahon’s schedule or that they’re going to

15

move in anywhere close to the alacrity of Judge McMahon.

16

Sixth, and something people kind of just passed

17

over, is if we go on the dual path that the Office of the

18

United States Trustee is recommending, we will have to --

19

they will brief in front of the Second Circuit a motion to

3

However, I did not just get up to echo a lot of

4

what Mr. Huebner has said or to lay some additional points.

5

Simply stated, everyone here talks about the need for speed

6

in this case.

7

wants this Court and all parties to take the risk that going

8

to the Second Circuit will not result in more expeditious

9

review in going to the Second Circuit -- in going to the

But the Office of the United States Trustee

district court.

11

Putting aside that we believe that the case law is

12

squarely against them, taking that risk will result in more

13

delay and more time between now and the effective date.

14

And the appellants implicitly are downplaying the

15

slowdown of a few weeks or maybe a month or two.

16

point I want to talk about, as it goes to the harm that will

17

occur if there is a slowdown in these cases.

I have one observation and one

Clearly there is a narrative that’s attempting to

19

be created, both in the papers filed in court and in the

20

press coverage of this and everything else that what Your

21

Honor did in this case was some extraordinary change of law.

22

And I think the direct certification motion is another

23

effort on the (indiscernible) to try to turn the

24

confirmation order, which Mr. Huebner has pointed out is

25

straight down the middle of existing law right now and turn

the process at this point.

3

And that’s not helpful to

And in order to make that point, you heard a

4

number of people wear the mantle of either a government

regulator or a government to say that they’re out there

are being deprived.

That is not able to be squared with the

13

case and they truly believe that, you would see the U.S.

14

Trustee objecting to every third party release.

15

see states intervening in bankruptcy cases, at confirmation,

16

to object to a third-party release of their citizens’ claim.

17

That doesn’t happen.

18

constitutional rights or parties, it’s their attempt to use

19

those constitutional rights to create a narrative that what

20

you did here is so extraordinary that this will be one of

21

the one in ten thousand (indiscernible) that gets directly

22

certified under the statue.

23

Your Honor to take judicial notice (indiscernible) that you

24

don’t have the United States Trustee objecting to every

25

third-party release either because it violates individual’s

2

3

party release to advance the position that their citizens

4

are being deprived of their (indiscernible).

5

And you

Now, with respect to the clarification, the U.S.

6

Trustee has repeated in this Court and elsewhere that -- and

7

it sounds good -- it’s not just that constitutional rights

8

are being violated, people’s property is being taken away

9

without compensation.

And you heard that today, that people

10

have Sackler claims and you, Your Honor, entered an order

11

which takes those claims away without compensation.

12

First -- and this is a point that the first words

13

out of Judge McMahon’s mouth in questioning the United

14

States Trustee is what claims are we talking about.

15

Identify for me a claim that exists against the Sacklers

16

that is being released under the plan that is not either

17

duplicative of a claim against the estates, or is it an

18

estate claim itself?

then.

20

them to identify (indiscernible) hearing if it goes forward

21

when we try to balance (indiscernible).

The U.S. Trustee was unable to do it

They are still unable to do it now.

I keep asking

22

But from our perspective, this is a policy point

23

over hypothetical claims that they say are being released.

24

But it is not true to say that the claims are being released

25

without compensation.

Counsel for the United States Trustee cited the

2

plan supplement to support her argument that says the plan

3

requires that nobody get paid (indiscernible) Sacklers.

4

That, again, sounds good, but not correct.

5

to Section 2(b)(1) of the non-NAS, the TDP.

6

this is an important word, “Claims will not be determined

7

based upon (indiscernible).”

8

right?

9

I just says when you’re trying to calculate what

I’ll just cite
It says, and

But the fact that the --

It doesn’t say that you’re not getting paid for it.

10

distributions will be under the TDP, it is without regard to

11

who caused the harm.

12

The fact that the determination of payouts is made

13

agnostic to where the harm comes from is not the same as

14

saying that the funds that are put there by the Sacklers are

15

not in payment in part for the Sackler claim.

16

confirmation record is clear that the release of direct

17

claims against the Sacklers related to opioid use and the

18

release of the -- or the channeling of the claims against

19

the Debtors, was a sine qua non of the Sackler’s agreement

20

to pay.

21

The

So it is incorrect, and from a third-party

22

perspective sensationally incorrect to say that the way the

23

plan works, and the confirmation order works, is that people

24

who have claims against the Sacklers are having those claims

25

taken away without compensation.

212-267-6868

It’s just that all of the

compensation comes through the TDP, at least for the

there is not going to be a specific allocation between

it, which of course is completely appropriate if we want to

there absolutely is compensation.

what we saw just to get the first step from the Second

then when you add in briefing, oral argument, and ruling,

unsurprisingly, you get to the GM outcome where the first

step was about three months, but then in the end it was

14

obviously over a year until they ruled.

is probably the best anybody could say.

THE COURT:

I’m sorry, I didn’t pose my question

I’m not asking you to waive rights with respect

to arguments where you are seeking a stay pending appeal.

3

I thought I heard him suggest that the state's argument that

4

it's impermissible for third-party releases to capture

5

police power claims, you know, was somehow contrived or

6

designed as a novel argument to argue for direct review.

7

But that argument appeared throughout the objections I know

8

of at least of Connecticut, Maryland, and the District of

9

Columbia as well as Washington and Oregon based on concepts

10

of federalism and the principle that the bankruptcy code

11

doesn't displace state's claims that implicate the public

12

health, safety, and welfare, and that is a point of law on

13

which there is no controlling laws -- the back and forth on

appealing states, while the relief we've sought is

essentially identical on this motion, that the U.S. Trustee

3

has raised on appeal issues that are in many ways broader

4

than the ones that the states are asserting.

5

the arguments that have been heard before regarding and

essentially deal with the merits seem to apply to the issues

necessarily to the states' issues which as I said are more

THE COURT:

But Mr. Gold, where does that lead?

14

mean, I -- one could logically infer from that that you're

suggesting that I certify a direct appeal of the states'

16

appeals and not the U.S. Trustee's and then we could be

consolidated on to the district court docket because they're

THE COURT:

So even if there are a bunch of

5

appeals in front of a district judge and a lot of them don't

6

satisfy 28 U.S.C. 158(d)(2), they get to ride along with

7

those that do?

9

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, that's an interesting

question and I understand that -- and I would say this.

I

10

mean, I think the important point is that we have raised

11

issues that we believe unambiguously do satisfy the

12

standard.

13

other issues do not and shouldn't be tagged along and aren't

14

subject to that, that's fine.

15

16

standard under the statutes has to be that every issue

17

that's been raised has to fall within this rubric.

If there has to be a winnowing, I understand that,

but that should not preclude issues that -- where it's valid

20

for this to be done and where certification should be done

to not be certified because there may be other issues in the

case.

applies to the number of cases that have ruled either way on

some decisions, can be applied where the claimants are

fair for argument.

there's a controlling decision on that point, we maintain,

This provision of the judicial a code was enacted

in 2005 as part of the BPACPA amendments and has been the

9

subject of substantial case law since then, not only at the

at the district court level, as well as at the circuit

11

As much as the parties' strong feelings on the

12

underlying merits of their appeals and the opposition to

13

those appeals may be, they generally share similar goals

14

here and more importantly, perhaps, the Court's

15

determination here is guided not by issues regarding the

16

merits of the appeals or even the merits of motions for

17

stays pending appeal, but rather, the jurisprudential

18

concerns set forth in the statute and the case law.

19

am quite aware of the precedential effect of an opinion,

20

tempting as that might be, that would go contrary to the

21

precedent and the jurisdictional framework of this

to expedite the case, not to limit the issues in the case

itself, not the speed of the appeal, but the conduct of the

case, and accordingly, have applied that section where it

has been applied to interlocutory appeals or appeals that

constitutes a final order will determine the direction of a

that Congress carefully limited the circumstances for a

direct appeal while introducing the possibility of the right

the circuit states, "nevertheless, although the Congress

questions of law and fact with some exceptions where the

Again, see Weaver

In addition, the courts have addressed at length

10

whether a question of law for purposes of this provision is

11

one "as to which there is no controlling decision of the

12

court of appeals for the circuit or of the Supreme Court of

13

the United States."

14

I will note that the U.S. Trustee made for the

15

first time at oral argument the argument that there need not

16

be a controlling decision -- I'm sorry -- that there may

17

need to be -- excuse me -- there may be a controlling

18

decision at the circuit level, but if there is not one at

19

the Supreme Court level, then subsection I is satisfied.

20

thoroughly disagree with that argument.

21

Supreme Court rules in a good year on one or two bankruptcy

22

matters, deny certiorari on scores of them, and the notion

23

that circuit law would not be controlling and instead, the

As far as what is controlling law for purposes of
subsection 2(a)(i), the courts have recognized that this may

10

be supplied by combining holdings from multiple cases, but

11

it is nevertheless law at the circuit level or if there's no

12

law at the circuit level, at the Supreme Court level which

13

admits no ambiguity in resolving the issue of pure law

14

because that's the first element of the requirement in (i).

19

Again, one is governed by the clear direction from

20

the Weaver case that the statute works where there is

21

discrete controlling question of law at stake that can be

22

decided without focusing on an extensive factual record.

23

The courts have dealt with arguments that try to find a

24

niche outside of controlling precedent and generally have

25

been wary of such arguments.

As noted by such courts, novel

the statute, no matter how important the matter be to a

particular case, does not in this provision require direct

certification where the circuit would be only deciding again

19

what it had previously decided in prior cases.

20

instead is on where the circuit would be asked to make new

21

22

question.

23

The focus

As the editors of Colliers note, most of the

24

requests for certification involving important matters of

can be said to have construed it narrowly.

opinions which, at best, the circuit would be asked to

3

refine the application of that case law to the particular

facts of this case not a pure question of law for purposes

of how that term is viewed in this provision.

The court also addressed the due process issues

either at the Supreme Court level or, where there is a

decision at the second circuit level, at that level.

12

addition, and as I noted in my ruling that's on appeal, the

13

applicability of due process concerns is substantially fact-

14

based and does not present a pure issue of law, I believe,

15

although, it is one that, I believe, is subject to rather

16

rapid review, given the record before the Court and the

ultimate ruling by the Court.

22

police power rights or their police power.

23

that assertion, albeit, that there are certainly decisions

24

in other circuits that address that point, although

25

primarily implicitly.

therefore, this argument, while certainly a perfectly

appropriate to make before me, falls into the category of

The bankruptcy code itself

And I believe that,

10

arguments that were addressed in, for example, Goody's

11

Family Clothing and Comex Holdings that I previously cited.

12

In addition, the question is not a pure question

13

of law, I believe, given that the nature of the police power

14

that is being asserted at this point was addressed as a

15

factual matter by the Court in the decision and order that

16

is the subject of the appeal.

17

types of police power, for example, would not be subject to

18

a mandatory release and injunction, as opposed to the types

19

of police power that are asserted or were asserted before me

and now are being asserted on appeal.

Clearly,

2

something is of public importance if the law is not clear,

3

and that law will come up again and again.

4

where guidance is warranted, as discussed in the Weber case,

5

from the circuit.

6

third-party claims releases in bankruptcy cases, while it

7

does come up often in bankruptcy cases, is the subject of

8

controlling decisions -- the plural -- in the second circuit

9

and that controlling case law, further, requires the Court

That's obviously

On the other hand, the topic of coerced

10

to make a detailed factual analysis which is, of course,

11

what I tried to do in my ruling that's now the subject of

12

appeal as required by the second circuit in the Metromedia

13

case and the cases that follow it.

14

So it appears to me that as the courts have

15

cabined the phrase "matter of public importance" to apply to

16

jurisprudential guidance, beyond that, in the normal

17

appellate process, this is not a matter of public

18

importance, because, again, it as Judge Gerber held in the

19

GM case, it's not a matter of public importance for purposes

20

of this statute, that the court decide again the type of

21

issue that it has decided in the past.

22

The motions, therefore, do not satisfy the first

23

prong of Section 158(2)(a) nor do they satisfy the second

24

prong, i.e., that judgment order or decree involves a

25

question of law requiring resolution of conflicting

212-267-6868

Page 196

decisions.

The case law is almost uniform, and this is

2

certainly consistent with the reading of the statute as a

3

whole, that the case law referred to in this section is case

4

law within the circuit below the circuit level.

5

given subsection (i) which focuses on controlling decisions

6

in the circuit, the fact that there is conflicting case law

7

outside of the circuit cannot be what Congress intended to

8

acquire a direct appeal of an issue that is not the subject

9

of conflicting decisions within the circuit.

Obviously,

Again, see I

25

as set forth in the Johns Manville, Drexel, and Metromedia

1

opinions as well as In re Quigley, following Metromedia,

2

that discusses the requirements in the Second Circuit for

3

the imposition of a third-party claims release in a

4

bankruptcy case.

5

That case law, as noted by Judge Wiles in In re

6

Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc., 599 717, 728 (Bankr.

7

S.D.N.Y. 2019) is governing -- the governing case law

8

requires me to consider, et cetera, et cetera the factors in

9

Metromedia.

Indeed, in that case, Judge Wiles found a basis

10

for a third-party release and exculpation that anyone who is

11

a lawyer would cite this opinion as being controlling case

12

law, and that includes law professors, must either be

13

wearing blinders or simply intending to misrepresent the law

14

in the Second Circuit.

15

Similarly, In re SunEdison, Inc., 576 B.R. 453

16

(Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2017) does not stand, as has been asserted

17

by the U.S. Trustee, for the proposition that Metromedia is

18

not controlling in this circuit and that the bankruptcy

19

courts in this circuit can chart their own paths without

20

following it.

21

Indeed, Judge Bernstein in that cases at pages 461

22

through 62 analyzed how Metromedia would apply and found

23

that it did not apply to the releases at issue, although he

24

did find that he had jurisdiction if the plan was amended to

25

comply with Metromedia id est 462.

212-267-6868

So I conclude that the

1

second prong, or the second alternative basis for certifying

2

a direct appeal, namely that set forth in Section 158(a)(ii)

3

does not apply here either.

4

Finally, the parties rely on the third prong,

5

namely (iii) "an immediate appeal from the judgment order or

6

decree may materially advance the progress of the case or

7

proceeding in which the appeal is taken."

8

too is a subject of considerable interpretation and again

9

should be read in the context of the entire section of the

judicial code.

11

The courts have been clear about the following.

12

First, consistent again with the Weber case, which I

13

previously quoted, the mere fact that leapfrogging the

15

determination is not what Congress had in mind in this

carefully as opposed to simply setting up a prong that would

obviate the careful consideration of the other two, except

2

where one would need to engage in speculation as to how fast

3

an appellate court might rule, something I don't believe

4

Congress really wanted the lower courts to engage in.

5

The courts have also made it clear that the fact

6

that parties on a near-certain basis will want to eventually

7

take their appeal to the circuit is not a basis for direct

8

certification.

10

Lab Holdings II LLC 543 B.R. 703 716-17 (Bkrtcy.D.Del.

11

2016).

12

I guess I can conceive of a situation, for

13

example, where the district judge that drew an appeal of a

14

matter that warranted expedited determination and could not

15

decide it because, for example, she was about to conduct a

16

three-month jury trial.

17

this provision and say under these circumstances, rather

18

than stay the matter or, alternatively, not stay it and risk

19

that there be no appellate review because of the doctrine of

20

equitable mootness would certify a direct appeal.

21

A court might take into account

I believe that concern clearly does not apply

22

here.

District Judge McMahon, who has the appeals, has

23

already set an expedited briefing schedule where she will

24

hear oral argument on November 3 -- 30, excuse me, bearing

25

out the Weber court's observation that normally appeals

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 200
1

through the district court through the circuit move faster.

2

The U.S. Trustee has pointed out that under 28

3

U.S.C. Section 158(2)(d), my certifying a direct appeal

4

would not stop or preclude Judge McMahon from deciding the

5

appeal before, and that is true.

6

knowing Judge McMahon's character and work ethic, that I do

7

not believe her knowing that I had certified a direct appeal

8

would cause her to put her pen down.

9

I believe it is also true,

And I understand that if she ruled, and I expect

10

she will soon after the appellate argument on November 30th,

11

i.e. sometime in December, the parties could go to the

12

circuit and say, "We're withdrawing our request that you

13

accept a direct appeal," and instead request that you too

14

seek expedited treatment -- or grant expedited treatment.

15

However, the two-track process would create an extra around

16

of decision making, including at the circuit level, extra

17

briefing and oral argument, and create its own docket, which

18

the record before me, I think, establishes at least that

19

that docket would have its own life and take its own time.

20

In addition, and this is a more important

21

consideration, one of the issues raised on appeal, which I

22

decided in favor of the Debtor's on, is that consistent with

23

the Third Circuit holding and district court level holding

24

in the Third Circuit and in the Second Circuit, and

25

bankruptcy court holding in the Section Circuit, the Court

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 201
1

has the power to issue a final order confirming a plan as a

2

fundamental aspect of the adjustment of debtor-creditor

3

relations under the Supreme Court Stern v. Marshall case

4

law.

5

Long ago, before that case law become much more

6

clarified, including at the supreme court level, the

7

district court entered an amended standing order that among

8

other things gave the district court the power to treat a

9

bankruptcy judge's determination, which the bankruptcy judge

10

believed could be a final order as proposed findings of fact

11

and conclusions of law, which of course Stern v. Marshall

12

would permit.

13

that can happen if it were certified directly to the

14

circuit, and the circuit took it and determined that I was

15

wrong on the Stern v. Marshall point and disagreed with the

16

Third Circuit in the Millennium II case, an extra step

17

involving proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law

18

would have to be taken, in all likelihood by the district

19

court, although perhaps by this Court on remand, ultimately.

20

That would waste time.

21

With the appeal in front of Judge McMahon,

There are arguments to be made on both sides on

22

that issue, but that issue, I believe, ultimately under

23

these facts is not what Congress in Section 158(2)(a)(iii) I

24

believe meant the Court to focus on, i.e. the speed of the

25

appeal process, unless in extreme situations that I've

its conclusion with legal issues defined along the way that

4

are gatekeeping issues.

5

not shown that a third prong of Section 158(d)(ii) has been

6

satisfied either.

7

It meant to focus on the case and

So I conclude that the movants have

Again, I do not view this determination as one

8

that requires a lot of heat or passion.

It's a

9

jurisprudential issue where the precedents are important and

10

where the courts have consistently held, and the Second

11

Circuit has consistently focused the courts on holding that

12

the Court should be careful in reading the statute broadly

13

and rather should issue a direct certification in only rare

14

instances, as I've previously outlined.

15

So I will ask the Debtors to submit an order

16

consistent with that ruling denying the motion.

17

say, the request for directive appeal of my September 15,

18

2021 order also does not meet the requirements of the

19

statute in any respect for the reasons that I've outlined.

20

There really was no attempt to do so by the U.S. Trustee.

21

And frankly, I think the only reason for it is the U.S.

22

Trustee's hope that the appeals would go forward together

23

because of its concern, or his concern, about mootness

24

issues, which really are more appropriately dealt with when

25

courts consider motions for stay pending appeal.

Needless to

So let's turn to the last matter on the agenda,

2

which is the pretrial conference that the Court previously

3

scheduled in our first conference on September 30 regarding

4

the motions for stay pending appeal filed by various parties

5

in interest, some of whom were not parties to the motion

6

that I've just decided because I noted at the beginning of

7

this morning's calendar, I've had a chance to review Judge

8

McMahon's order from the 13th of this month denying without

9

prejudice the United States Trustee's emergency motion for a

10

stay pending appeal.

11

I'm not sure that motion when she granted the TRO

12

actually advised Judge McMahon that the parties were already

13

going to be appearing on that issue before me on November

14

9th.

15

without prejudice on the conditions stated in her order,

16

which I fully agree with and hope I had already signaled to

17

the parties they should agree with so that the November 9

18

hearing can move forward, as I think Congress contemplated

19

in the 8,000 rules of the bankruptcy rules.

But in any event, Judge McMahon denied the motion

20

So I left this matter with the parties hoping that

21

we wouldn't need to have a long conferences when we were

22

last here at the end of September, and I think the only

23

issues that really were going to come up, if at all, applied

24

to whether parties would be offering witnesses, or which

25

parties would be offering witnesses, and which discovery

particularly in light of the imminent -- then-imminent

ruling by Judge McMahon.

6

Now you've just -- now we can't hear you at all.

MR. HURLEY:

(Indiscernible).

On the non-movant

8

side, the agreeing parties are the Debtors, the UCC, Ad Hoc

Committee of Governmental and other (indiscernible), and the

10

Ad Hoc Group of Individual Victims, plus the Ad Hoc Group

MR. HURLEY:

THE COURT:

They want to see what your witnesses say.

4

MR. HURLEY:

5

THE COURT:

I believe that's right, Your Honor.
Okay.

All right.

So it's

6

contemplated that this may be an evidentiary hearing with

7

live witness testimony, in which case someone should have

8

marked up an order for that purpose, similar to the order

that applied for the confirmation hearing, you know, an

10

been a long hearing.

16

on this regard.

17

Your Honor, this is Ben Higgins for

Yes.
Thank you, Your Honor.

I know it's

I just have a couple points to address

First, I want to correct what Mr. Huebner said.

18

Our emergency motion did reference the November 9th hearing

19

on the opening page and again on Page 13, so I want to make

20

sure the record is clear about that.

21

Second, the U.S. Trustee is okay with the proposed

22

schedule, but we do want to emphasize that there is already

23

an extensive evidentiary record after a multiday trial, and

24

we don't think a second extensive trial is appropriate or

25

necessary for the Court to decide the motions for a stay

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 211
1

pending appeal, and that is now especially true in light of

2

Judge McMahon's ruling yesterday, which we think is at least

3

persuasive authority for this Court when it ultimately rules

4

on the stay issue.

5

And as Your Honor is aware, it's not unusual for

6

parties to simply move orally for a stay pending appeal

7

after a Court's ruling, but here when Your Honor issued a

8

conditional bench ruling at the trial's convulsion, we felt

9

it was both prudent and necessary for the sake of a clear

10

record to take the time to actually read the transcript of

11

Your Honor's decision and to file a written motion.

12

And to the question of witnesses, we have filed a

13

designation identifying the various documents in the

14

extensive record that we support that -- we believe support

15

any factual assertions in our briefs, so we don't intend to

16

put on any affirmative witnesses.

17

We do intend to file very shortly an amended brief

18

that simply adds the specific citations to those designated

19

portions of the record.

20

rebuttal witnesses, but we're hoping that won't be

21

necessary.

22

We do reserve the right to put on

But as Judge McMahon made clear in her ruling

23

yesterday, and Your Honor made clear back on September 30th,

24

these appeals should be determined on their merits.

25

light of those statements from both the bankruptcy court and

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

In

516-608-2400

Page 212
1

now the district court, we believe it should be clear that

2

the parties can all save some time here by simply agreeing

3

to a stay pending appeal as Your Honor suggested back on

4

September 30th.

5

forward with the proposed schedule and with the November 9th

6

hearing.

7

But if necessary, we're prepared to go

With regard to the motion to quash that Your Honor

As you've noted, we

We believe the notice is

10

inappropriate and that it seeks irrelevant information, and

11

the mental impressions and strategy of the attorneys

12

representing the U.S. Trustee, and we look forward to that

13

conference with Your Honor if we can't work that out with

14

the PI group.

15

And the last point, Your Honor, which is a little

16

bit off track, but it is related to the scheduling, is that

17

we have asked the Debtors to provide status reports

18

disclosing what they are actually doing to prepare for the

19

sentencing date and the effective date.

20

looking for anything elaborate, but to the extent there is

21

not a stay, which will be the case when Judge McMahon's TRO

22

is dissolved, we think there should be some visibility for

23

the Court and the parties to see what actions are actually

24

taking place so we can have some assurance that they are

25

truly just administrative or administerial in nature.

And we aren't

So

516-608-2400

Page 213
1

the Debtors haven't responded to this request, Your Honor,

2

but to the extent there is no stay in place, we would -- we

3

would ask the Court to direct them to provide some type of

4

regular status report in that regard.

I have nothing further, Your Honor, unless you

Page 214
1

In any case, we are going to work through that

2

with UCC, but we have a preliminary position to all of this

3

similar to the Trustee's, which is that discovery certainly

4

shouldn't be necessary in this case in light of the record

5

that Your Honor already has.

6

I think you're familiar with the plan and what it

7

does, and you've heard extensive evidence on the need for

8

the plan and issues that relate to what the plan does in

9

helping with the problem that is the opioid crisis and what

10

is at stake here.

11

confirmation hearing was about.

12

Rule 9017, which incorporates Federal Rule of Civil

13

Procedure 43(C), a standard where it's in the Court's

14

discretion what it needs to hear outside the record, and

15

it's largely a standard of what will assist the Court in

16

resolving the stay motions, and I think that the Court

17

likely knows all that it needs to know from the record it's

18

already received without the added burden on both the

19

estate, and the parties, and the Court, all three, of

20

hearing evidence and entertaining motions on discovery,

21

especially over issues that the Court has been hearing about

22

and is well versed in after two years of litigation. The

23

issues of irreparable harm, which is the justification for

24

the discovery, are -- ought to be readily apparent to the

25

Court.

THE COURT:

So think as

7

whether the Court really needs that, and I think that the

9

burden, and expense, and use of judicial resources.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

and said definitively they are not willing to put anything

4

The third question was around what Your Honor laid

5

out before, which is the identification of the claims that

they are asserting, that is when we -- we talk about the

obviously those cites need to be evidence.

12

you know, some -- and that includes a hearing in Congress.

13

That's not evidence, particular one that --

14

MR. HIGGINS:

15

THE COURT:

But

They can't be,

Sure, Your Honor.
-- was scheduled apparently to

16

highlight the testimony of someone who had a live issue

17

before me, I think in part to influence me outside of the

18

courtroom, which I find truly outrageous.

So it's not

19

evidence, but you guys can work that out.

I'm sure you're

20

able to resolve that.

21

And I reiterate that while this hearing is

22

important, it seems to me, given the schedule that Judge

23

McMahon has outlined, and her understanding of already the

24

balance between the public interest and irreparable harm,

25

and of course she will have dealt with the merits, that --

1

before, I believe, the plan would ever go effective, the

2

parties seriously consider what judges in these situations

3

fairly often do where there is an expedited appeal, reaching

4

an agreement to have a stay in place for a brief period

5

after a ruling by Judge McMahon on the merits of the appeal

6

that gives her the opportunity, and you, to have the type of

7

hearing before her that you were planning to have in front

8

of me on the 9th.

9

that.

I think you all should seriously consider

She will have had the benefits then of full briefing

10

on the merits and can certainly analyze that prong, and it

11

would obviate the need for two hearings.

12

Now, you may want to set some record here, and I

13

don't know whether the U.S. Trustee still wants to pursue

14

the stay on the September 15 order.

15

hearing on that, although I think you know where Judge

16

McMahon is on that, and I think you can assume that's where

17

I am on that.

18

I think I should have a

So I am sympathetic to the statements by Mr.

19

Higgins and Mr. Edmunds that perhaps the parties can

20

stipulate that by agreeing to a stay, say for 10 days or 10

21

business days or 10 days after the issuance of Judge

22

McMahon's ruling, the parties will not hold that agreement

23

against anyone as far as any future requests for a stay, but

24

that would apply so that you don't have to have two hearings

25

and spend the money that could otherwise be going to

victims, one way or another.

2

So that's not a ruling, of course, but it's a

3

suggestion and a fairly strong one.

4

this out not just in my court but in the court of public

5

opinion, but frankly, that's not a court, and I think that

6

it's just a foolish exercise to do that.

7

you all if you don't reach that type of agreement, and you

8

may want to set out the record so that you can have it, and

9

that's fine with me.

10

And that's also acceptable to me, but

So I don't know if anyone has anything more to say
on the pretrial conference, prehearing conference.

13
14

But I will hear

I would not be averse to that type of agreement either.

11
12

I suppose you all play

MR. SHORE:

No?

Your Honor, nothing on the pretrial

conference, but I've got one other issue to address today.

15

THE COURT:

Okay.

16

MR. SHORE:

Under the confirmation order, the

17

1129(a)(4) applications are due Monday would be -- which

18

would put it as a setting on the November 18th omnibus.

19

can't do that date.

20

to move it to the December and move out the deadline?

21

THE COURT:

Do you want me just to -- do you want

Yeah.

22

mean, you're still working.

23

have two hearings.

24

lot of different things.

25

MR. SHORE:

212-267-6868

I think we should move it.

I

Among other things, I'd have to

I'm trying not to have two hearings on a

THE COURT:

That's fine.

4

MR. SHORE:

-- and have the papers come in no

later than December 2nd, and then we'll at least have had --

6

you know, we'll have certainly a, I hope, a ruling from

Judge McMahon before that hearing would --

I agreed to that.
