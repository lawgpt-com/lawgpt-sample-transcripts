Monica Geller: Hi.
Carol Willick: How's it going?
Monica Geller: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Carol Willick: Fine, whatever.
Ross Geller: What's the matter?
Carol Willick: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Ross Geller: What?
Monica Geller: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Ross Geller: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
Carol Willick: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Ross Geller: Oh my god.
Carol Willick: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
Ross Geller: It's ok. I'm sorry.
Carol Willick: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Ross Geller: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Carol Willick: You do?
Ross Geller: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Carol Willick: Of course I do.
Ross Geller: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Carol Willick: You're right. Of course you're right.
Monica Geller: So we're back on?
Carol Willick: We're back on.
Monica Geller: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
