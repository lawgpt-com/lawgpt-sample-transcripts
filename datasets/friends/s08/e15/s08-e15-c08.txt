Phoebe Buffay: How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Ross Geller: I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Phoebe Buffay: Taffy, really? I've never had any.
Ross Geller: Ever?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
Ross Geller: Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
Phoebe Buffay: she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?
