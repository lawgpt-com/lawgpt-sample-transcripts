Ross Geller: Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
Chandler Bing: You do? Why?
Ross Geller: Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Chandler Bing: What?! Why did you do that?
Ross Geller: I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Chandler Bing: How could it not matter?!
Ross Geller: How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Chandler Bing: What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Ross Geller: I don't know, I-I was all high.
