Rachel Green: You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Tag Jones: Sure.
Rachel Green: Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Tag Jones: If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Rachel Green: No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Tag Jones: What contracts?
Rachel Green: Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Tag Jones: Like what?
Rachel Green: Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Tag Jones: Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Rachel Green: Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Tag Jones: I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Rachel Green: Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Tag Jones: No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Rachel Green: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Tag Jones: You wanna go down to the office right now?
Rachel Green: No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Tag Jones: Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Rachel Green: Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
