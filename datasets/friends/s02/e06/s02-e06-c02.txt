Phoebe Buffay: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Rachel Green: Ok.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
Terry: Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
Rachel Green: What's up?
Terry: F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Rachel Green: But what about Phoebe?
Terry: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Rachel Green: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Terry: Uh--
Rachel Green: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Phoebe Buffay: Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
