Chandler Bing: Hi honey I'm home.
Monica Geller: From the tequila factory?
Chandler Bing: It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Monica Geller: Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Chandler Bing: Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Monica Geller: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Chandler Bing: Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
