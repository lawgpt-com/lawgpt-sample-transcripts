Professor Spafford: And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
Ross Geller: So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Professor Spafford: And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Ross Geller: Oh, it's not over!
Professor Spafford: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Ross Geller: So basically all nuts?
Professor Spafford: Interestingly... no.
Charlie Wheeler: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
Professor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.
Charlie Wheeler: Oh my God!!
Ross Geller: I've lost the will to live.
Charlie Wheeler: Let's ditch him!
Ross Geller: What?
Charlie Wheeler: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Ross Geller: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Charlie Wheeler: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!
