Joey Tribbiani: That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
#ALL#: Great!

Chandler Bing: You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Monica Geller: Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Monica Geller: What's Phase Two?
Joey Tribbiani: Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Rachel Green: How does going to a strip club help him better?
Ross Geller: Because there are naked ladies there.
Joey Tribbiani: Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Ross Geller: There are naked ladies there too.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Would you give me one minute!! Please.
