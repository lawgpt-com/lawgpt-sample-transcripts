Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Chandler Bing: Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Chandler Bing: Oh my... God?
Joey Tribbiani: Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Chandler Bing: So, what're you gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Chandler Bing: Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Joey Tribbiani: I've never slept with someone for a part.
Chandler Bing: Well is she...
Joey Tribbiani: Sorry.
Chandler Bing: It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Chandler Bing: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Joey Tribbiani: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Chandler Bing: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
