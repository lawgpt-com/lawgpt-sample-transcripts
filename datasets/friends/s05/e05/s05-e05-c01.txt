Joey Tribbiani: Monica? What time is it?
Chandler Bing: Uhh, 9.
Joey Tribbiani: But it's dark out.
Monica Geller: Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Joey Tribbiani: I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Monica Geller: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Chandler Bing: I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Monica Geller: All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Monica Geller: Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Chandler Bing: Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Monica Geller: Wait! What about Joey?
