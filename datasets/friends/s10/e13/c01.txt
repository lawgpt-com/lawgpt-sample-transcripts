Phoebe Buffay: Hi.
#ALL#: Hey! Hi!
Rachel Green: How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!
Rachel Green: Oh!
Chandler Bing: So, where's Mike?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Joey Tribbiani: Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, why? What's up?
Joey Tribbiani: I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in.
Ross Geller: Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Monica Geller: Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Ross Geller: It was ok...
Rachel Green: I did not know you spoke French.
Phoebe Buffay: Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Rachel Green: Oh... you're so sexy!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Phoebe Buffay: Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
Rachel Green: Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
