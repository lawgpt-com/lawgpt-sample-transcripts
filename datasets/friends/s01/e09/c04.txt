Ross Geller: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Chandler Bing: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.

Monica Geller: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rachel Green: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Monica Geller: Rach, here's your mail.
Rachel Green: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Monica Geller: No, here's your mail.
Rachel Green: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Monica Geller: Would you just open it?
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Monica Geller: We all chipped in.
Joey Tribbiani: We did?
Monica Geller: You owe me 20 bucks.
Rachel Green: Thank you. Thank you so much!
Monica Geller: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Rachel Green: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler Bing: All right, I'm nine years old.
Ross Geller: Oh, I hate this story.
Chandler Bing: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Rachel Green: Oh my god.
Chandler Bing: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
