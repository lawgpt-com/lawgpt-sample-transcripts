Phoebe Buffay: No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Monica Geller: Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
Monica Geller: Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Chandler Bing: Who cares? It's a stupid game.
Monica Geller: You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
Chandler Bing: I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
Monica Geller: No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Chandler Bing: Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Monica Geller: Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
