Mike Hannigan: No, my parents are rich.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!
Mike Hannigan: Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.
Phoebe Buffay: Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Bitsy Hannigan: It's so nice to finally meet you!
Phoebe Buffay: And you... Your home is lovely.
Bitsy Hannigan: Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
Phoebe Buffay: Holy crap!
Bitsy Hannigan: Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, try and stop me!
Mike Hannigan: Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
Mike Hannigan: Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not Phoebe...
Phoebe Buffay: Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Mike Hannigan: Well, come on...
Theodore: Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Bitsy Hannigan: Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?
Phoebe Buffay: Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?
