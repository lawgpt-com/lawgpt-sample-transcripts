Ross Geller: So uh, have a great time down there.
Elizabeth Stevens: I will.
Ross Geller: Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Elizabeth Stevens: Yeah.
Ross Geller: It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Elizabeth Stevens: Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Ross Geller: Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Elizabeth Stevens: Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Ross Geller: Really?
Elizabeth Stevens: Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Ross Geller: Okay. Cool.
Elizabeth Stevens: Oh hey! Here they are!
