Ross Geller: So, Saturday night!
Missy Goldberg: I'd love to!
Ross Geller: Great!
Missy Goldberg: So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ross Geller: Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Missy Goldberg: Sure, he was in your "band"?
Ross Geller: It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Missy Goldberg: Sorry.
Ross Geller: That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Missy Goldberg: Really?
Ross Geller: Yeah, why?
Missy Goldberg: Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Ross Geller: You did?
Missy Goldberg: Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Ross Geller: AND ON MY TURF?
