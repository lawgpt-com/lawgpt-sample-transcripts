Judy Geller: So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Jack Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.
Chandler Bing: Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Monica Geller: Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Jack Geller: Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
Judy Geller: You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Chandler Bing: What a sweet story.
Monica Geller: Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Jack Geller: What?! They wanted a scary story!
Monica Geller: Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Judy Geller: You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
Monica Geller: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Jack Geller: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
