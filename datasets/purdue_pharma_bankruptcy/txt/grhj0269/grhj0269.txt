Let me start over again.

Good morning, this is Judge Drain.

Thanks.
We're here in

12

In Re Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., on the second and last day

13

of oral argument on the Debtors' request for confirmation of

14

their amended Chapter 11 plan.

15

I have the order of topics and time that the

16

parties have agreed to allocate to them, which the parties

17

circulated overnight.

18

for purposes of today's hearing.

19

MR. HUEBNER:

And I'm happy to follow that order

Perfect, Your Honor.

Good morning.

20

For the record, Marshall Huebner, from Davis Polk &

21

Wardwell, on behalf of the Debtors.

22

Your Honor, two things before we start the agenda.

23

You know, as always, we have sort of a dual role as a plan

24

proponent and as an advocate sometimes for our stakeholders,

25

but also a shepherd of the process.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 17
1

Your Honor, I think it was not lost on anybody on

2

Monday that Your Honor expressed strong views about

3

attempting to get to a deal with a final very small number

4

of stakeholders not yet onboard.

5

mentioned the heroic effort of Judge Chapman, who worked in

6

Phase 3 of mediation.

7

I believe three times you

I do want to advise the Court that Judge Chapman

8

seems to have heard that, and she is absolutely back in the

9

saddle, working extraordinarily hard, again, as a sitting

10

judge, for, of course, no compensation, just part of public

11

service, to try to see if anything can be done.

12

As I'm sure it's also not going to be a surprise

13

for the Court to hear, further work tailoring and narrowing

14

the releases is something that is the subject of many of the

15

objections, and certainly the subject of a fair number of

16

very clear thoughts from the Judge.

17

And so while on one hand, because there are

18

elements that are being discussed among the parties.

19

won't say more than that, except that the Debtors are

20

working around the clock to try to facilitate to see if

21

something can be done assisting Judge Chapman.

22

And I

There are other elements as well, as there were in

23

round 3 of mediation.

24

economics and other things.

25

That would be inappropriate, and so, of course, I won't.

212-267-6868

There were new covenants and
And I can't say more than that.

But a fourth or additional element is the

releases.

position that that should be sorted used as part of a

potential big set of final trades in a ground-floor

mediation by Judge Chapman.

6

been the right answer.

7

Strategically, one might have argued for a

But I think that would not have

The right answer is to fix (indiscernible) it now

8

and give the Court and all parties comfort that people,

9

including on the Sackler side, and facilitated very strongly

10

by the Debtors and others, continuously recalibrating and

11

trying to make this the best possible deal for all Purdue

12

stakeholders.

13

In the middle of the night last night, we filed

14

the ninth amended plan of reorganization, which really does

15

one thing primarily, which is substantially further narrow

16

and tailor the third-party releases that I think it's fair

17

to say lie at the heart of much of the colloquy and

18

objection at this hearing.

19

And so rather than saving it to be offered in

20

mediation, which is now basically ongoing, it's in already

It's very complicated.

25

We are working around the

So in about 30 seconds, I will turn the podium

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 19
1

over to Mr. Uzzi, who will, I think, probably be in the best

2

position to describe to describe those releases, and how

3

they have changed, and how it is hopefully important to the

4

objectors , and also quite important to the Court.

5

But before I do that, one over item in my other

6

role, which is I do want to let the Court know that the Gulf

7

objection, as Your Honor may remember, was argued by Mr.

8

Luskin (indiscernible) with Mr. Tobak, negotiations towards

9

settling that also continue, as we are.

Obviously, as

10

you've seen, you know, every time I get up, we have either

11

another settlement or fewer objections to announce.

12

everyone knows that's our MO, and we're still doing it here

13

at the last day of oral argument.

14

procedural matters before we get to the agenda.

15

I think

And so those are the two

So with that, with the Court's permission, I'd ask

16

Mr. Uzzi to help explain the changes, and certainly in the

17

minds of the Sacklers, you know, the changes that they made.

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

Before I hear from Mr. Uzzi, I

19

think I ought to say two things.

20

to Judge Chapman about her continuation as a mediator in the

21

case, either before or after what you have just described.

22

Nevertheless, I'm quite grateful to her, you know, if she's

23

been willing to take on that role.

24

encourage the parties to try to resolve their differences,

25

including with her really dedicated and expert efforts,

212-267-6868

First, I have not spoken

And I obviously

the case, she brought to this one.

4

development.

5

grateful for it, and it's certainly in line with the

6

admonition I gave to the parties on Monday.

7

So I welcome that

Although it's a surprise to me.

But I'm

Secondly, unfortunately, I have not had the

8

opportunity to review the change in the ninth amended plan.

9

So I'm largely in listening mode here, not commenting mode.

10

But again, I welcome the parties continued work on the scope

11

of the release and injunction of third-party claims.

12
13

So, having said that, I'm happy to hear from Mr.
Uzzi.

14

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, before he begins, just

15

two very quick notes.

16

due, the first round mediators also continued after

17

mediation formally entered (indiscernible) mediation --

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. HUEBNER:

20

THE COURT:

I understand that.
-- privilege -And, you know, we've been really

21

fortunate to have world-class mediators in this case, and

22

they take their role -- they took their role and take their

23

role seriously and continued beyond the original time

24

allocated.

25

mediation order.

212-267-6868

And you know, again, I encouraged that under the
And similarly, even though my mediation

516-608-2400

Page 21
1

order for Judge Chapman set a specific deadline for the

2

parties, and as everyone knows, deadlines are important,

3

based on what you've described to me, the discussions that

4

are ongoing now are similarly under that order.

5

a similar deadline, which is I intend to rule on Friday on

6

this request for confirmation on the plan.

7

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah, Your Honor.

If you face

That was the

8

tentative point I was going to make.

I actually did not

9

have time to double check it, but hopefully my memory is

10

right, that the order actually expressly contemplates post-

11

mediation conversations that I actually believe keep our --

12

remained governed by the confidentiality shields.

13

everyone who is having those conversations is treating them

14

as such.

15

And so,

So with that, Your Honor, let me turn my

16

microphone off and turn it over to Mr. Uzzi to explain what

17

was filed overnight.

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. UZZI:

20

Okay.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Milbank, on behalf of the Raymond Sackler family.

21

Your Honor, I think what I'd like to do here is

22

explain to you what we try to accomplish and the changes,

23

but not necessarily go through those changes line by line.

24

Obviously, if you'd like us to do that, we can do that as

25

well.

just for the sake of clarity of the record, I think there

As we worked on this over the last day, we decided

2

to make really what I think is a material change here as it

relates to the third-party releases of the shareholder

consultants.

5

the shareholder consultants are carved out -- with one

exception I'll talk about in the second -- are carved out of

the release, the third-party release, completely.

And that is to simply carve them out.

And so

Because of that, we then removed the defined

necessary anymore and doesn't and shouldn't probably apply

22

to the other parties that were in the release who are

23

similarly situated to what I would call the core releasees

here.

I'll note further, Your Honor, if the exhibit had

5

The fact is, my firm doesn't need a release, so we

carved ourself out.

And we did that because I, along with

7

all of my co-advisors here, we do not want to be a

8

distraction here.

9

third-party advisors are also off the schedule.

So Milbank is out, and the other named
And we hope

10

that that goes a material way to addressing all of the

11

concerns.

12

The other issue we tried to address, Your Honor,

13

is to be further responsive on the non-opioid-related

14

claims.

15

there was some colloquy over what did that mean.

16

I'll say we've added "reckless" to the definition there of

17

the type of conduct, the predicate conduct or the predicate

18

state of mind, I should say, that would trigger that.

19

And as you'll remember from Monday, Your Honor,
First,

Your Honor asked me if that definition picked up

20

fraud, and I incorrectly said no.

I went back and read it and I think under that definition,

22

it already picked up fraud.

23

broader than fraud, are not limited to fraud.

24

operative word, when you take a look at it, Your Honor, is

25

"unlawful."

212-267-6868

All right?

And I apologize for that.

And actually, things are a lot
And the

So, clearly, fraud is unlawful, but

And I think that that word

6

THE COURT:

Well, again, I haven't had a chance to

parse the language, but I appreciate the overview.

I guess

4

what I would say -- and I appreciate that these changes, as

5

you've described them, are constructive and have narrowed

considerably the release -- is that I'll carve out some time

7

at the end of today's argument for people who have objected

8

on the basis of the breadth of the release, and that only.

9

Not any other aspects of the release, but just the breadth

10

of the release, to have the chance to point out to me their

11

view, if they still have it, that the releases still overly

broad.

that brings us to the first item on the agenda, which is

3

so we're fine with that.

4

my initial plan of 20, for fairness and symmetry, and

5

because I have something I want to begin with before I

actually head into best interests.

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. HUEBNER:

9

Mr. Goldman asked for 35 minutes,
I may run a little bit longer than

Okay.
Your Honor, there was some

interesting colloquies from the Court, pretty scholarly,

10

frankly, for those of us who are, you know, bankruptcy

11

folks.

12

on 57-259, about the factor of Metromedia that requires, or

13

seems to contemplate, creditors being paid in full, which

14

just makes no analytic sense, because there's nothing to

15

release if creditors are paid in full.

16

millennium labs and their fairness test, the much more

17

recent Third Circuit decision, as seemingly a logical

18

imperative and much more sensible.

19

On Pages 180-182 of the transcript, and then again

And Your Honor cited

In addition, Your Honor, you actually cited

20

ourself to 1129(a)(7) on Page 181, Line 12-16, and said, you

21

know, isn't this the right answer?

22

-- 1129(a)(7) requires that you're getting more than you

23

would get in another scenario, is not definitionally fair,

24

so that proving the best interests test may actually be kind

25

of what the Third Circuit meant.

212-267-6868

Because if 1127 requires

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 29
1

Third Circuit Standard, as of course I think all

2

litigants in this case know, in their recent decision from

3

2019, is that, "The hallmarks of permissible nonconsensual

4

releases are fairness, necessity to reorganization, and

5

specific factual findings to support these conclusions."

6

That's Metromedia at Page 139.

7

I'm just so tired -- at Page 139.

8
9

I'm sorry -- Millenium --

So I think that's actually dead on.

And so, you

know, when I now will launch into my best interests

10

argument, which is really so important because it is the

11

view of basically everybody in the case, rather than one

12

objector, implicitly or explicitly, that this is the highest

13

and best recovery for creditors, and it is better than a

14

liquidation,

15

think that actually the Third Circuit maybe had it right.

16

And fairness means, you know, if you can't do better than

17

what we're getting for you under this plan, what else should

18

we be doing but this plan?

plus the pursuit of third-party claims.

I

19

So with that, if Your Honor will let me launch it.

20

THE COURT:

Can I -- and I, at risk of -- and I

21

don't think it's -- it doesn't derail your argument, but I

22

want to be clear.

Section 1129(7), is a statutory test, and one needs to

follow the words of the statute.

212-267-6868

The best interests test, as set out in

And the courts to some

plain terms.

2

What I was addressing contemplates one

3

interpretation of the best interests test.

But even if one

4

takes the other interpretation of it, which is that you

5

don't look at what one gets on one's claim in the case, you

6

just look at what you get on the claim in the case, I think

7

that fairness, in the sense described not only by the

8

Millenium Court, but actually in the earlier section of

9

Quigley by Judge Bernstein, requires some analysis, if it

10

can be done, into what sort of recovery the enjoined parties

11

would have if the plan were not confirmed.

And that's not

12

applying strictly the best interests test.

That's a more

13

rigorous view of fairness than one might normally apply to a

14

9019 settlement, in other words.

15

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, I agree completely.

And

16

as you'll hopefully here in a few minutes, I'm going to

17

cover every alternative interpretation of 1129(a)(7), and

18

show you why we are extraordinarily comfortable that we meet

19

the statute's 24:16

20

we meet the statute's ____

Your Honor, 1129(a)(7), as of course everyone

21

knows, requires that the Debtors demonstrate that rejecting

22

impaired creditors who receive no less under the plan than

23

they would in the hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation.

24
25

Here, Your Honor, the Debtors' proposed plan is
expected to distribute well in excess of $5.5 billion in

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 31
1

cash on account of contingent liability claims.

There is no

2

dispute that creditors will recover billions more under

3

claims against the Debtors than they would recover if the

4

Debtors had to liquidate.

5

The only possible dispute is whether the rejecting

6

creditors could actually recover, in a Debtor liquidation on

7

their own third-party claims against the Sacklers and

8

others, value that exceeds all of their many recoveries

9

under the plan, including the settlement of those third-

10

party claims, but as to a very small number of parties is

11

being imposed by the will and the votes and positions of the

12

overwhelming majority.

13

why this objection fails.

14

There are three principal objections

First, as Your Honor just noted, the Second

15

Circuit has not actually determined whether third-party

16

claims should be considered at all in the best interests

17

analysis.

18

agree with Quigley and Ditech.

19

And other courts that are also thoughtful, do not

The AHC argued this in their brief at Pages 155-

20

158.

I will actually rest of their papers on this point,

21

because I actually prefer to spend my time on the assumption

22

that it is obligatory, including for the larger fairness

23

reasons, for us to get the Court and all parties comfortable

24

that even rejecting creditors do better under this plan than

25

any other alternative we know of.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 32
1

So, Your Honor, if you accord with Quigley and

2

Ditech, which is just fine for us and many others, it is

3

clear beyond peradventure that under the holdings of those

4

cases, we are not required to assign a specific dollar value

5

to the potential recoveries on rejecting creditors'

6

unknowable, inestimable third-party claims.

7

To the contrary, both of those cases make it

8

crystal clear that the value of third-party claims is only

9

to be considered when the claims are both, one, not

10

speculative, and two, capable of estimation.

11

Let's take a close look at those cases.

Quigley

12

is an asbestos case in which Judge Bernstein estimated the

13

value of third-party claims against Pfizer, Quigley's

14

parent, based on a 19-year track record of settlements, for

15

which Pfizer had paid over $1.2 billion and a mathematical

16

average of 23 percent of the claims asserted against it over

17

almost two decades.

track record, the claims at issue were not speculative and

19

were capable of estimation.

And unlike in Ditech, the Debtors have
consistently stated that the value of an individual

rejecting creditor's direct claims, what they would actually

11

recover some day if this plan failed, is the very definition

of unknowable and unquantifiable.

13

Your Honor, given the Debtors' extensive record

14

evidence on liquidation, including its DelConte expert

15

report, Paragraph 9, et seq., the disclosure settlement

16

Sections 173-175, the objectors really need to demonstrate

17

that their own actual recoveries on direct claims in a

And that abatement

10

results in "multiplier effects" that provide creditors,

11

especially governments, I believe, with value that may well

exceed the dollar value distributed under the plan.

13

In the liquidation, there can be no guarantee that

14

all or most or even a substantial portion of the funds

15

creditors someday recover from the Sacklers would actually

16

have to go to abatement, and thus, this important multiplier

17

is gone.

For these 11 reasons, Your Honor, among others,

claims that in these complex circumstances are speculative

2

and not capable of estimation.

3

Your Honor, that brings me to my third and final

4

meta point.

While I hope that my reasons each individually,

5

and certainly collectively, demonstrate the views of so many

6

for whom I'm speaking today, that rejecting creditors would

7

not do better in the liquidation, and would do ever so

8

terribly worse even inclusive of their direct claims.

13

done the work for years, litigating against Purdue and the

14

they have concluded that the Plan provides superior value to

states than does liquidation.

argue fearsome, mass tort plaintiffs' firms and other

litigation firms in this country whose clients I can

2

In stark contrast to the wild speculation to the

3

nth power, they would be involved in assessing what an

4

individual rejecting creditor, out of 614,000 competitors,

5

would actually recover in liquidation, the market of states

6

identically situated to the one best interest set of

7

objectors, has spoken on this point with extraordinary

8

clarity, and chosen which gives them the better recovery.

9

And of course, Your Honor, the bankruptcy system

10

under the guidance of the Supreme Court, love market tests

11

to prove things.

12

There's no better way to know what something is worth than

13

what people will actually choose when faced with a choice.

14

80 percent of identically situated claimants clearly think

15

that their direct claims against the Sackler cannot close

16

the more than $5.5 billion gap between what people are

17

getting under the Plan to help their citizens in these

18

terrible times.

19

would be creditors fighting one another and competing

another.

See e.g., 203 N. Lasalle, 119 S.Ct. 1411.

And the alternative, whose worst feature

And for the record, Your Honor, the $5.5 billion

22

number that I have been using is exceedingly conservative

23

because it does not take into account, as our evidence shows

24

recoveries on insurance proceeds, which we hope are the

25

billions, and terminal asset value when NewCo is monetized,

that it's slated also to flow all but exclusively to

2

governmental creditors, these very objecting creditors, for

3

abatement with its multiplier under the Plan.

4

I also didn't count PHI, which many people believe

5

itself could be worth billions, especially to states by

6

avoiding further damage, and helping their citizens, or the

7

public spillover multiplier.

8

$5.5 billion is just the cash in the sworn evidence and

9

nothing more.

10

None of that is in the math.

And, Your Honor, this is therefore a much more

11

central plaintivist case than just best interest.

12

hold that any alternative to this Plan, and certainly

13

liquidation, would create for all creditors, but for the

14

states far more than anyone else, is way bigger than $5.5

15

billion, and it cannot possibly be refilled and then

16

exceeded by a liquidation and direct suits against the

Page 49

for my argument?

As you mentioned, it requires that in a

2

peered class of creditors, each of the class members must

3

either accept the Plan or will receive under the Plan, at

4

least as much as they would receive in a Chapter 7.

5

THE COURT:

Actually, that isn't the specific

6

language of 1129(a)(7), right?

7

respect to each impaired class or claims... each holder of a

8

claim or interest of such class has accepted the plan; or" -

9

- and then here's the key language -- "will receive" will

The provision says, "With

10

replayed -- "or retained under the plan on account of such

11

claim... property of a value as of the effective date of the

12

plan that is not less than the amount that such holder would

so receive or retain if the debtor were liquidated under

chapter 7 of this title".

15

because I think it's arguably there for a reason.

16

the AHC objection points out, it would seem to modify on

account of such claim, and therefore, focus the Court on the

MR. GOLDMAN:

2

THE COURT:

That's -- that's fair.
-- again, I -- as I said to Mr.

3

Huebner, I'm not sure ultimately this matters because I

4

think consistent with the section of the Quigley case as

5

well as other cases that have considered plans that have

6

sought to impose a third-party release or injunction, it is

7

incumbent on the Court to look at what's being given up

8

under the plan in terms of evaluating that request, whether

9

or not it's under 1129(a)(7), too.

10

So, I just wanted to note the issue.

I -- to me,

11

I can't ignore the word.

I will note also that "claim" is

12

not defined as a claim against the debtor in 1015 of the

13

Code.

14

fairly large can of worms if courts started to look at all

15

sorts of recoveries from third-party sources, that one would

16

get under it in Chapter 7 as a mandatory exercise for

17

confirming a plan.

On the other hand, it would, I think, open up a

18

But maybe it's -- maybe it's academic given the

19

larger point that I think controls here, which is that I

20

have to look at -- beyond the 9019 analysis because that

21

really applies to the Debtors' estate and creditors -- what

22

it is that the injunction of third-party claims would

23

deprive the objectors of, or alternatively, whether it's

24

actually a fair deal for them.

25

MR. GOLDMAN:

THE COURT:

2

MR. GOLDMAN:

Sure.
Okay.

Yes.

Go ahead.

So, as the Dietech court

3

observed, according -- from an earlier Southern District

4

case, the command of Section 1129(a)(7)(ii) is perhaps the

5

strongest protection creditors have in Chapter 11.

6

I think Mr. Huebner's argument that because 80 or

7

90 percent of the states have accepted the Plan, should

8

somehow mean that the best interest test is satisfied.

9

Well, if you go with the majority or super-majority of

10

creditors who are voting in favor of the Plan, that

11

essentially wipes out the purpose of the best interest test,

12

which was -- is to protect the dissenting creditors.

must be right.

creditors here are California, Connecticut, Delaware, the

District of Columbia, Maryland, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode

Island, Vermont, and Washington.

7

And the best interest of creditors requires a

8

comparison of what those dissenting creditors would receive

9

under the Plan, and what they were to receive in a

10

11

Class 4 creditors would receive under the Plan in relation

to what they all would receive in a liquidation.

analysis is focused on the dissenting creditors.

comparison.

21

And on the other side of the equation, because in

Chapter 7 there would be no third-party releases, it's our

contention there must be some proof of what the dissenting

3,900 proofs of claim were identified as being consumer-

No such analysis was done in this case.

THE COURT:

But in -- in Dietech, Dietech and its

What I have here is something more attenuated.

have the settlements from the 2007 period.

That's not to say that because there is no

MR. GOLDMAN:

to you on that.

I just -- I don't -- my -- I thought that

based on the settlement data they had, that none had gone to

judgment, but I'm not completely sure about that --

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. GOLDMAN:

7

Okay.
-- now that Your Honor has raised

the point.

8

The fact -- it's ironic that the fact that no

settlement and litigation data is available here is the

10

result of the Debtors' own doing.

11

12

Sacklers for almost two years by the preliminary injunction,

13

that the Debtors were asked -- weren't even successful in

that standstill to argue that the claims can't be valued

16

because there's no settlement data.

17

I mean, the states have

They shouldn't be able to turn around now and use

But if the states had been permitted to go

18

forward, we may very well have had some settlement data or

19

judgments in either direction for the Court to make a

20

decision on this task.

21

THE COURT:

But I guess that goes to the other

22

point, which is the primary point I think that the Debtors

23

have been making, which is they have focused only lightly on

24

the strength of the states' claims against the Sacklers and

25

very heavily on the recovery that the states would have on

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 61
1

those claims.

2

MR. GOLDMAN:

3

THE COURT:

4

They haven't focused.
They have focused primarily on the

recovery that the states would have on those claims.

5

MR. GOLDMAN:

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes.

And I -- I will get to that.

Okay.
Point, Your Honor.

But before I do

8

that, I'd like to address the argument that they make in

9

their brief that in order for it to be true that holders of

10

all third-party claims would be better off in a liquidation

11

because of the value of claims released under the Plan, the

12

aggregate recovery due in those claims, it would be -- it

13

exceeds $4.8 billion.

14

Now, Mr. DelConte confirmed, the Debtors made no

15

attempt to even ascertain the universe of creditors that are

16

asserting claims against the Sacklers.

17

simply assuming that every creditor in the case would assert

18

claims against the Sacklers and that all those claims would

19

be completely homogenous, would not vary in their merit, or

20

type of claim, and that is simply not a valid assumption.

21

The Debtors are

They did not do the analysis that was done in

22

Ditech to see which creditors were asserting claims against

23

the Sacklers, and I'm not aware of any proof of claim in the

24

case that was asserted against the Sacklers as opposed to

25

the Debtor.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 62

Second, the best interest test requires looking at

2

what the dissenting creditors would receive on their direct

3

claims.

4

the holders of all third-party claims, which the Debtors

5

haven't even identified, would receive, in a hypothetical --

6

We'll recover, I acknowledge recovery, and now with

THE COURT:

But I think the point is the dilutive

7

8

it to that.

9

against the Debtors, and I think we know a fair number of

The claims of the individual states filed

10

the governmental entities, non-state governmental entities,

11

as well as the liquidated value of those claims.

12

I think their point is that even if you confine it

13

to that aggregate amount, there would be an enormous

14

dilutive effect, not that you would measure what the others

15

got, but that the effect of their pursuit of those claims

16

would dilute the objector's recovery, along with various

17

other things too, like the cost and delay.

18

MR. GOLDMAN:

I do understand the point, but I'm

19

not sure that it's a valid assumption that every state is

20

asserting claims against the Sacklers; not all states did

21

file claims against the Sacklers.

22

was made to identify which complaints were actually filed.

23

And if they weren't filed, which states intended to make

24

claims against the Sacklers, but not because of the Chapter

25

11 filing in September of 2019 and the preliminary

I don't think any effort

2

So my point is they simply haven't been

3

identified.

4

everyone would make claims against the Sacklers, but there

5

really is no evidence that all of them would is my point.

6

They've asked Your Honor to assume that

And as to the competing claims of the estates

7

against the trust, I would submit that analysis ignores that

8

if just three states get judgments against one or more of

9

the Sacklers, they could be put into involuntary bankruptcy

10

where the interest in their offshore trusts would be

11

susceptible to becoming property of their estates.

12

analysis was done on the effect of a potential bankruptcy

13

filing and what that would mean in terms of their interests

14

in the trusts and whether the estates' claims against the

15

trust would prevail or have priority over those interests

16

that could possibly become property of the estate.

17

THE COURT:

18

MR. GOLDMAN:

19

THE COURT:

20

No

Can we just -There's no -I think you're making two points there

and I want to just make sure I understand them.

21

There would be estate claims that would be

22

asserted by Purdue in a liquidation against the trust,

23

fraudulent transfer claims.

24

that, and as well as the recoverability of that.

25

have said that they would dispute it if, in fact, there was

212-267-6868

We do have expert testimony on

Parties

litigation, but they haven't disputed it in this case.

2

Under the stipulation, there's no adverse consequence to

3

them for having not disputed it.

4

And then I think you're saying that in a Sackler

5

parties bankruptcy, the assets of the estate or his or her

6

estate would become property of the estate.

7

testimony, I believe, that most, if not all, of those trusts

8

are spendthrift trusts, which you would have to adjudicate

9

in, I believe, Jersey.

10

MR. GOLDMAN:

But there is

Well, to the extent those trusts are

11

self-settled with monies from the settlors, I think they're

12

vulnerable to attack.

13

brief about the Greenwich v. Tyson case in Connecticut, they

14

all presume that the trusts were not self-settled.

15

settled trusts are not given protection from creditors.

So I would just make the point that they could be

17

vulnerable to that type of challenge in an individual

18

bankruptcy.

19

But even getting beyond that, you know, the --

THE COURT:

But again, there would be a factual

20

determination of that in a Sackler bankruptcy, an individual

Sackler personal bankruptcy, but then you'd have to enforce

22

that judgment against the assets of the trust, which I think

23

mean you'd have to go through Jersey.

24

Jersey, I don't mean the state of New Jersey, I mean the

25

bailiwick of New Jersey.

And when I say

MR. GOLDMAN:

I understand.

I understand what you

mean.

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. GOLDMAN:

Right.
And I acknowledge that, Your Honor.

5

But I know the states, the states would be poised to do that

6

I'm sure.

7

THE COURT:

Well, they might well be poised, but

8

they didn't cross-examine Mr. Cushing on their ability to

9

actually move from being poised to collecting.

10

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, I'm merely pointing out that

11

that analysis on the bankruptcy aspect of this was not done

12

in terms of an individual bankruptcy of any of the Sacklers

13

that might suffer judgments from the states.

14

And beyond that, I'm presuming since they would be

15

themselves the subject of Chapter 11 cases, their post-

16

bankruptcy income would also become part of their estates

17

and, you know, going forward.

18

So the trust would not be the only source of

19

recovery.

20

would come into their bankruptcy estates and potentially --

21

well, basically, all of their assets and interest in

22

property, and no analysis was done on that.

23

You'd also have their interest in the IACs that

And I think that it's important that it had to

24

have been done because in the absence of a confirmed plan

25

and if the states are committed to go forward, we would

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 66
1

maintain it's likely that the estates would obtain judgments

2

against one or more of the Sacklers and is a likelihood that

3

they could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding.

4

And I would just also note that this idea that the

5

disclosure statement and the assumption that these claims

6

are just speculative and not capable of estimation shouldn't

7

be held to satisfy their burden of proof on the best

8

interest of creditors test, given its importance to

9

dissenting creditors like the ones we have here.

10

As the Bankruptcy Court stated in In re. Mcorp,

11

137 B.R. at 228, a proposed plan of reorganization may not

be confirmed where the evidence is not sufficient on which

13

to base an independent determination that the proposed plan

is in the best interest to creditors.

And I submit that was

Just to briefly address a few points that Mr.
Huebner made.

I don't want to forget those.

18

I viewed his point that we can't prove the

recovery as effectively shifting the burden of proof on the

So if we took in good

So the states -- I mean, I think -- I

don't want to really -- I think that the personal injury

claimants would say, well, who was supposed to be regulating

Purdue if not its home state and the federal government, the

12

two of which got the most taxes.

13

to whether a failure regulation warrants any sort of either

presumption of knowledge as to the taxes or some basis to

subordinate claims.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Your Honor, I think I'll be

5

relatively brief, but there are some things that were said

6

that -- there were quite a few things that were said

7

factually, but I think it's worth letting everybody know it.

8

And, you know, this is actually a much more

9

important conversation that he raised than just best

10

interests because in many ways, this is the heart of

11

everything, which is why are so many people in favor of

12

doing this as opposed to its alternative.

13

actually embrace a demanding Third Circuit standard that

14

this is the fairest, best outcome under extraordinary

15

outcomes, which is why we didn't actually brief that Ditech

16

don't really apply, someone else did, because we're fine

17

within the plan.

18

And so, I

And here you asked me a few days ago during cross-

19

examination to not get into conceptions of justice and

20

fairness, but let's talk about a few things that are more

21

directly relevant to the statute.

22

is you've heard me say many times, I have never once ever

23

defended Purdue's past conduct or the Sacklers.

24

in March 2018.

25

Number one, Your Honor,

We arrived

But the facts are that it was not the Sacklers who

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 69
1

paid $75,000 to New York State; it was Purdue.

And in

2

Oklahoma, the Sacklers were note even sued; Purdue was sued.

3

And Purdue paid to settle that for a variety of reasons and

4

the Sacklers were not parties to the consent judgment and

5

made a voluntary contribution of $75 million.

6

suits have expanded and were they thinking lots of complex

7

things when they settled?

8

have been, so I don't know and it's not my business.

Might those

They are not my clients and never

9

But the facts are that there is no track record, I

10

believe, which is part of what angers so many people, of the

11

Sacklers actually having had judgments entered against them.

12

I believe there are none.

13

Your Honor, the first point -- and I appreciate

The witness under oath was Mr. DelConte.

"Q: And could you tell the Court why is it that

8

you didn't account or put a value on those causes of

9

action?"

10

This is in response to the questions that he got

about direct claims.

11

"A: We did not.

We determined that we couldn't

12

adequately estimate the value of those potential claims, you

13

know, based on the fact that, as I testified before and as

14

laid out in the disclosure statement, the fact that there's

15

a number of different causes of action that various third

16

parties could have against the shareholders, as well as a

17

number of defenses that the shareholders could have against

18

those particular causes of action and the fact that none of

19

these causes of action had been taken to judgment to date.

20

We didn't think that we were accurately able to estimate

21

what the total value should be, so we determined that we

should not include that in the liquidation analysis."

the claims were not estimable.

Your Honor, the next issue is that, you know, with

10

all due respect, he actually ignored every single one of my

11 points, right, and it's basically now agreed, as the

12

record makes clear, that the five to six to seven billion

13

dollars of Debtor value is gone in a liquidation.

What he did was he said there's no evidence of

what any individual creditor gets.

There's no expert because

2

Well, here's my answer to that.

With all due

3

respect to Mr. Goldman, who is in the 1/500th of 1 percent

4

of our creditors who objected to confirmation, many of us

5

have spent years figuring out how to get the best deal and

6

analyzing the all risks and rewards.

7

And here's the testimony, which is in evidence,

8

from Mr. Atkinson, whose declaration is extraordinarily

9

important and attaches the UCC letter which went out to all

10

creditors and is extraordinarily important.

11

Paragraph 11:

"At the outset of these Chapter 11 cases, Akin and

17

potential estate claims against the Sacklers and related

entities, the likely damages associated with such claims,

19

and the likelihood of collecting on any judgment rendered in

favor of such claims."

21

This also included an

The Court, I know, is more than familiar with the

19

straightforward rules governing classification, the first

20

set forth in Section 1122(a) is that claims or interests may

21

be classified together if they're "substantially similar."

22

The second is that a Debtor has a great deal of flexibility

23

to place similar claims into different classes and can do so

as long as there is a legitimate reason for it, but doesn't

have to.

interfere with its authority to promote the safety and well-

2

being of its inhabitants.

3

that local governments have both the duty and the authority

4

to pursue defendants of mass tort-related incidents

5

including opioid defendants.

6

examples of that.

7

It is quite clear, Your Honor,

And the record is replete with

For example, Your Honor, if you were to look at

8

Paragraph 20 of the MSGE Group reply is support of plan

9

confirmation, we list a litany of cases demonstrating that

10

local governments have standing to bring such claims and in

11

Paragraph 16 to 19 and 21 to 24, we have another litany of

12

cases demonstrating the survival of motions to dismiss by

13

those same governmental entities.

14

It is also clear, Your Honor, that very recently

15

in Tennessee, nine counties and eighteen cities and towns

16

reached a tentative 35-million-dollar settlement with Endo

17

Corporation, another opioid defendant, on July 22nd of 2021.

18

And in three other state courts, Your Honor, California, New

19

York, and West Virginia, county and city plaintiffs are

20

either currently in trial or have recently concluded trial

21

and are waiting verdicts seeking billions of dollars in

22

damages.

23

And, of course, as the Debtor's counsel aptly

24

noted, Your Honor, it is, of course, true that under the

25

proposed plan, cities and counties are part of the abatement

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 87
1

efforts and a very important part of the abatement efforts

2

set forth in the plan that we week confirmation of here

3

today.

4

And, of course, one final point, Your Honor, the

5

parens patriae argument made by the objecting states is

6

overstated first of all, because parens patriae powers do

7

belong to the various states and localities in their various

8

circumstances as our brief pointed out.

9

proprietary actions that all local governments can bring

And secondly, the

10

heavy overlap with such parens patriae actions as pointed

11

out also in the authorities that we cited you to.

12

To make a long story short, Your Honor, there is

13

no valid basis to argue the states must be classified

14

separately from local government and the surprising

15

suggestion in the states objections that local governments

16

don't have valuable and important rights to pursue against

17

opioid defendants is just incredibly shortsighted as well as

18

misleading and just flatly wrong.

19

Your Honor, we support the Debtors in this particular

20

example of argument as well as overall with the plan.

21

restate Your Honor that local governments and states, in

22

fact, are appropriately classified together in Class 4.

supports why the states should be classified separately.

That is not something that can be brought by municipalities.

MR. GOLD:

No, Your Honor.
Okay.
I will first note that it is the

12

Debtors' burden to prove that the classifications were

13

proper.

14

classification error can be fixed by going back to the

15

voting results and preparing a count of what the results

16

would have been had the states been in a separate class.

17

The Debtors have argued that the argued that the

And frankly, Your Honor, I find this is amazing.

18

The Debtors waited until after the votes had been cast to

19

rearrange them into a better classification.

A classification error cannot be fixed through a

hypothetical analysis of how the votes might have been

arranged under a different classification.

13

The caselaw could not be clearer that the focus as far as

14

1122 of the Bankruptcy Code is concerned, which refers to

15

substantially similar claims, goes to the right of the

16

claimant against the assets of the estate.

17

although you don't have to, classify claims based on breach

18

of contract in the same class with claims based on tort

19

because each of them is unsecured and has the same right

against the debtor's assets, general unsecured claims.

there any aspect of your argument that is consistent with

that proposition?

23

But let me just cut to

21

would direct Your Honor to Page 16 of our confirmation brief

22

and No. 27, where we go through a number cases that have

23

held a one dollar -- in a mass tort case, a one dollar

24

voting amount is appropriate.

25

to Your Honor the A.H. Robbins analysis, which was affirmed

212-267-6868

On the legal aspects of the one dollar claim, I

And I would just like to read

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 94

by the Fourth Circuit: "Any attempt to evaluate each

2

individual claim for purposes of voting on the debtors plan

3

of reorganization would, as a practical matter, be an act of

4

futility and would be so time consuming as to impose on many

5

deserving claimants further intolerable delay not only to

6

their detriment but to the detriment of the financial well-

7

being of the estate as well."

8

And I think, Your Honor, that analysis totally

9

applies here and clearly justifies the one dollar voting

10

amount because to liquidate the various and complex

11

interrelated claims of all of the claimants here would have

12

been essentially an impossible undertaking and certainly the

13

gain would not have been worth the gamble, Your Honor, as

14

noted by A.H. Robin and a litany of other cases cited in our

15

brief.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

Very well.

I guess to me,

17

ultimately the fact that the class that the objecting states

18

say that they would want to be in, which would be a class of

19

states only, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan,

20

suggests that they would want to fight it out with these

21

other 38 states as to the amounts of their claims, which I

22

don't think is what Mr. Gold was saying, which is that the

23

local governments have smaller claims.

24

is a nonmaterial amendment to a plan to allow a plan to be

25

amended to reclassify in a class if one believed that the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I actually think it

516-608-2400

Page 95
1

class needed to be reclassified.

2

So I guess, to me, this seems to be unlike some of

3

the other arguments that the objecting states have made,

4

just an attempt to throw sand in the gears without any real

5

merit to it whatsoever.

6

So why don't we move onto the next topic, which is

7

the NOAT allocation issue raised as the only basis for West

8

Virginia's objection to the plan and I think here, counsel

9

for the Ad Hoc Committee of States and other Governmental

10

Entities will argue in support of the plan and then we'll

11

hear from West Virginia's counsel in support of the

12

objection.

Before I start, I just want to thank

my Kramer Levin colleagues who have worked on this matter.

20

Your Honor, there are difficult questions that you

21

need to answer in this hearing, but allocation is not one of

22

them.

23

not really a close question.

24

3

4

one has disagreed.

6

In fact, 49 --

THE COURT:

I actually think it's 47 to 1, but

that's okay.

7

MR. WAGNER:

I won't round up to 49, but it's 1 on

8

the other side and if the plan is so grossly unfair, why is

9

it that only one state is objecting?

These numbers alone

10

could be used to justify compliance with the code, but even

11

if you put aside those numbers and address the objections on

12

its merits, it's clear that this plan satisfies the code.

13

And as Mr. Huebner noted, no plan is perfect, but this one

14

is pretty good.

15

It's also fair to West Virginia.

As we heard during the testimony, West Virginia

16

has about half a percent of the nation's population, but is

getting more than twice that under the plan.

is because the plan takes into account the intensity and

the outset, that the issue of the opioid epidemic is quite

17

severe in our state, and regardless of all of the issues

18

that you're hearing about, I think one area that we can find

19

in common with virtually every party, is everyone would

20

mention that West Virginia was ground zero at the opioid

21

epidemic.

22

Virginia had the most horrific of experience with the level

23

of intensity and severity that I think virtually all counsel

would concede.

MR. MORRISEY:

It has changed.

I know that the

11

most recent formula that we've looked at, they have an

12

intensity fund applying to ten states that then would be

13

able to claim up to 15 percent of the aggregate dollars that

14

Congress appropriates.

15

THE COURT:

Okay.

16

MR. MORRISEY:

So if we step back to Counsel's

17

arguments that this plan was made in good intention, I think

18

that that statement could be torn apart fairly quickly.

19

Let's start with something that Counsel indicates is a very

20

small issue, and you can make an argument about whether 1

21

percent of the aggregate funds going to a particular state

22

is small or large, but when you're talking about the largest

23

state in the country for all the states to come together

24

behind, what I would call, the California carveout or cash

25

grab, you're talking about a significant amount of money.

piece is one of the blites on this deal that needs to be

2

changed, because once again, it's not good faith to allow

3

one state to not contribute to a fund that every other state

4

does.

5

The second piece, which I think is equally

powerful, is that most of this formula is once again based

upon population.

8

closely at the formula when you're looking at morphine

it's clear that we're effectively quadrupling the population

12

testified to that fact without any contravention.

13

That's something that's not rational when you're

14

trying to solve a problem.

15

is consistent with many other matters that get settled by

5

my colleagues ultimately decided to move in a different

6

direction, but the importance for this Court, for this

7

precedent, to get it correct, to do two things; eliminating

that California carve out, and two, asking to go back and to

9

either: a) change the population based system and move it

And of course, there were rigorous
I recognize that many of

10

more to an intensity system, or b) simply taking an easier

11

tactic, which would be to move from 1 percent of intensity

12

fund to 2 percent or 3 percent, which I would note is very

13

different than what SAMHSA recommends, at 15 percent.

14

would create a much different abatement structure, which is

15

going to allow money to flow to the communities that

16

actually need it most.

17

here to do, to make sure that money gets out quickly.

18

That's why we've tried to work collaboratively with the

see this as a fatal flaw of the agreement.

But, Your Honor, you have the ability to help

change that and to convince the parties that a California

America very, very upset, and separately, the intensity fund

is still inadequate, given the fact that when you solve a

get voted out on a particular issue like this because our

I'm asking this is you do have a very good record here, Mr.

California piece, unless I'm missing some piece of it, is

22

that one can argue that if you took law enforcement as an

allocation factor and Mr. Cowan, did testify that that could

24

be taken as an allocation factor, California would actually

25

be getting a lot more.

really aren't that different than the other 47.

there's something in the record that suggests that they are

enforcement activity, particularly related to opioids.

MR. HUEBNER:

from the Debtors, if the states are able to work this out

amongst themselves in connection with the Court's, I think,

18

pretty strong direction, we think that'll be fabulous.

19

the Court, nonetheless, felt in the absence of such an

20

agreement, that the Court was essentially going to direct

21

it, this is not the debtor's fight, but we would certainly

22

not have no objection to that as the plan proponent it is

view has at least some small relevance and we would not

object.

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Thank you.

Your Honor, I would just make one

point.

This is Kenneth Eckstein.

I do want to point out --

4

and I hear Your Honor's suggestion, and I think we would

5

obviously love to have that consensus achieved.

6

to point out that California remains an (indiscernible)

7

state and I don't --

THE COURT:

MR. ECKSTEIN:

-- hold out the likelihood that

we're going to be able to resolve this specific issue with a

state still objecting to the plan.

standpoint, I don't want to give the wrong impression, Your

13

Honor, about what's (indiscernible).

14

THE COURT:

That's fair.

So from a resolution

I just -- I want -- I

California's joined in the Oregon and Washington objection

about this issue.

It's -- look, I'm just pointing out my concern
That's all.

MR. ECKSTEIN:

could to bring the broadest possible consensus.

for more.

is where the settlement came to rest.

THE COURT:

9

MR. UNDERWOOD:

They're looking to

-- money in this case.
That's correct, Your Honor.

And

10

where I was going from the outset was this notion,

11

effectively, that the Sacklers cast a dark pale over this

12

entire settlement by suggesting that -- there's a pinhole

13

that they suggest that they would walk away from this plan

14

in the event that these releases are not approved.

15

don't know whether that's true or not.

16

And I

But what they've done is to -- effectively, this

17

Court is administering non-Debtor assets in Canada by way of

18

the IACs and the rights of the Canadian Claimants in Canada

19

to bring claims against the Sacklers.

20

jurisdictionally in the first instance here, that's a bit of

21

a problem.

22

And I think that

Now I'll go to Section 106, and I guess the

23

related issue, which is the way that this plan was

24

structured, if you were an international creditor, you were

25

given the devil's choice of filing a claim and affirmatively

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 123
1

participating in this process or not filing a claim and

2

seeing how it played out.

3

to pursue assets elsewhere.

4

And I guess reserving your rights

The problem is that this Court -- because of the

5

fact that the overall resolution here is actually

6

administering non-Debtor assets in such a vast manner, that

7

it's a bit unfair, generally, I think, to hold the Canadian

8

Creditors to the kind of global Section 106 waiver that the

9

Debtors would suggest.

And the Debtors cite no case law

10

about the scope of 106.

11

understanding of what Section 106 is, is it's a defensive

12

provision effectively to make sure that there are counter-

13

claims under the Bankruptcy Code that can be brought so that

14

if a sovereign submits to this Court an affirmative claim,

15

there can be counterclaims.

16

And I think in principle, my

Now, in this case, there's been no allegation of

17

any form of Debtor claim, counterclaim, avoidance action

18

claim against Canada.

19

participating is preserving its rights.

20

obviously the Canadian Municipal Creditors are glad they

21

participated because, frankly, assets in Canada are being

22

directed under the plan confirmed here to U.S. trusts, and

23

those are U.S. trusts, which the Canadian Municipal

24

Creditors and First Nations are not -- they're not

25

beneficiaries.

212-267-6868

All Canada's set to do by

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And in fact,

516-608-2400

Page 124
1

And this is really because of the manner in which

2

the Debtor has structured this plan.

And when I say that, I

3

-- we would have no argument here today had the Debtor

4

effectively put the Canadian Municipal and First Nation

5

Creditors in Classes 4 and 5 under the plan.

6

actually, factually, that's exactly what my clients thought

7

up until -- and the Debtor admits this -- up until virtually

8

a week before the plan objection on the sixth amended plan

9

was due, at which point the Canadians were advised, well,

And in fact,

10

despite the fact that you received ballots in Classes 4 and

11

5, you're actually going to be treated in Class 11C.

12

And it was at that point that the Canadian

13

Municipalities and First Nations realized that merely filing

14

a claim in this case was not going to be enough to preserve

15

their rights before this Court, and that they would have to

16

take the actions they have taken since that point.

But bear

17

in mind, Your Honor, that was a point 30 days ago.

I think

18

there was a presumption on the part of the Canadians that by

19

filing a claim, their claim would get -- again, in same

20

manner and fashion, and fairly with respect to other

21

similarly situated claims.

22

Now, the Debtor clearly will make a distinction

23

between the Canadian Municipal claims and Canadian First

24

Nation claim, and the municipality claims, the State claims,

25

the City claims that are filed by the United States

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

entities.

2

reference to how different those claims are.

3

actually factually driven down why is a Canadian state

4

different -- or excuse me, a Canadian municipality different

5

from a U.S. municipality.

6

And they make that distinction by a nebulous
They've never

I would assert that the main difference is that

7

there was a coalition of U.S. states and later

8

municipalities that understood that they were -- and did

9

press in their own direction to establish the classes under

10

the plan, and that that was something that the Canadians

11

presumed that ultimately they would be brought into.

12

they waited patiently, and ultimately, that never happened.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. UNDERWOOD:

15

Well -And that, again, is why we're

here.

16
17

And

THE COURT:

-- the objection itself acknowledges

that the plan says what it says, which is that --

18

MR. UNDERWOOD:

19

THE COURT:

Right.

-- they're in the -- that the class

20

that would receive the governmental entities and the class

21

that would receive Native American tribes that would receive

22

distributions for abatement purposes through the trust would

23

be U.S. governmental entities and tribes governed by U.S.

24

law.

25

acknowledged.

I mean, that's -- that is clear in the plan, and it's

212-267-6868

So I think the issue here, the legal issue,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 126
1

is not that your clients have a right to be in that -- in

2

one of those two classes depending on whether they're a

3

First Nations Creditor or a Canadian Municipal Creditor, but

4

whether their treatment in the Class 11 is somehow improper.

5

Now, Class 11 --

6

MR. UNDERWOOD:

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. UNDERWOOD:

9

THE COURT:

10

And --

-- Class 11 voted for the plan, right?
It --

In favor of the plan.

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Interestingly enough, Your Honor,

11

I think if you look at the voting tabulation for Class 11C,

12

and we did examine (indiscernible) tabulation, the

13

tabulation -- had the Canadian Creditors been able to

14

(indiscernible) dollar claim, the tabulation would have been

15

-- I think in terms of numerosity, the majority of creditors

16

in 11C, no matter how you slice it, would have voted in

17

favor of 11C.

18

But in terms of overall value, but for the dollar

19

value restriction, if you attribute any reasonable value to

20

the Canadian First Nations claims in terms of dollar value,

21

that class would've voted against the plan.

22

THE COURT:

And I don't --

But those claims are unliquidated.

23

And the Debtors, I think, are correct.

24

proofs of claim myself, it's very hard to see from the

25

claims whether they're against the Debtors or against Perdue

212-267-6868

Having received the

516-608-2400

3

dollar amount.

4

So there's been no

I don't know why you don't count the

MR. UNDERWOOD:

And I don't want to waste a lot of

5

the Court's time on that subject.

6

come down to is the Debtor hasn't presented anything to

7

suggest these Canadian municipalities and First Nations are

8

any different than tribes or cities in the U.S.

9

does that mean --

10

THE COURT:

I think what we really

Now what

But I would push back on that too.

11

They do say that there's a substantial issue, which again, I

12

could not get to the bottom of in looking at the proofs of

13

claim and the complaints attached to, as to whether these

14

claims are against Perdue Canada or against the Debtors.

15

And it's only to the extent they're against the Debtors that

16

they would even have a right to recover.

17

And of course, if they're against Perdue Canada,

18

they're not covered by the injunction under the plan.

19

on top of that, and we just spent about 40 minutes on this

20

issue, it's quite clear to me that as far as the allocation

21

under the plan is concerned on the public side, the

22

governmental entities side, it's pretty much a minor

23

miracle, but it did happen that those public entities were

24

able to agree on an allocation.

25

And

But I have no basis to think that that agreement

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 128
1

would then include folding in foreign creditors who did not

2

participate, and I don't think sought to participate, in the

3

mediation on that issue.

4

MR. UNDERWOOD:

5

THE COURT:

And -I think --

And so, you know, I think courts have

6

been recognized that there is a basis for separate

7

classification.

8

foreign claimants and U.S. claimants as long as there's a

9

rational basis for it, and including in the Sixth Circuit in

In fact, making a distinction even between

10

12

Now, that was a case where there was evidence as

13

to the different types of recovery in different countries.

14

So -- but the principle is you don't have to -- you can

15

discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors if

16

there's a rational basis for it.

17

a rational basis.

18

And it seems to me there's

I -- what is not clear to me is whether these

19

three -- I'm sorry, I think it's -- not three, I think it's

20

six creditors, would have any right to get involved in the

21

allocation abatement aspect of this, and frankly, how much,

22

if they even did, would go to them as opposed to their share

23

of the $15 million in cash, which is coming out right away,

24

which they could certainly apply to abatement if they

25

liquidate their claims and they're against the U.S.

answer that question from my own perspective, and you could

try to persuade me otherwise.

13

a many-months-long process in the mediation with Messrs.

14

Fineburg and Philips, as well as a mediation among the

15

states themselves, regarding the public side allocation,

16

which was incredibly difficult.

17

how do we open that.

18

people -- look, I -- people did ask to be involved in the

19

mediation.

20

okay, but I think not having participated in that, and I

21

can't predict how that would've turned out if the -- if your

22

clients had sought and been granted the right to participate

23

in it, whether the U.S. entities would've said, no, it's

24

just too complicated.

25

And frankly, I don't see

I just -- you know, there was --

The NAACP asked to be involved in it.

But leave that aside.

212-267-6868

I think the answer is we had

I said

it.

And at this point, we would be rewriting rules that

2

just, you know, I think the Debtor has the perfect right

3

under the Bankruptcy Code to have separate classification

4

and given the acceptance of the plan, separate treatment by

5

these two -- well, it was -- really would be four because

6

you have the Native American tribes and the First Nation

7

tribes, four different classes.

8
9

So, you know, it's not as if the class in which
the -- your clients are classified are getting nothing.

10

They're getting money upfront.

There's no argument that

11

they would be getting more in the -- if they had

12

participated in the no-added Native American tribes class.

13

And indeed given the acceptance by Class 11, I don't think

14

that argument flies because that's a cram-down argument.

15

That's an 1129(b) disparate treatment or unfair treatment

16

argument.

So I just -- I don't -- to me, this objection sort

a different class was a problem, and that's why I actually

2

started this argument at a different -- perhaps a higher

3

level, which is ultimately what happens here is material to

4

the global perception of U.S. courts and their manner in

5

which they deal with creditors.

6

And I think that the perception of the Debtors not

7

having addressed foreign municipalities in the same way that

8

they addressed U.S. municipalities when -- and let's face

9

it.

If they were all vendors, the fact that they were

10

across the state border would not have impacted -- all other

11

things being equal would not have impacted their

12

classifications, and they would have this (indiscernible).

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. UNDERWOOD:

15

THE COURT:

16

I agree with that.
All right.

I agree with that.

On the other hand

--

17

MR. UNDERWOOD:

18

THE COURT:

So --

On the other hand, if they were

19

personal injury claimants, a la the Dow Corning case, the

20

Court -- the plan proponent wouldn't be within its rights to

21

have a separate classification if there was a rational basis

22

for it based on the different nature of their recovery.

23

again, there is a -- there was a very lengthy, expensive,

24

and well-publicized process here to mediate the allocation

25

and treatment of public creditors that those who wish to

212-267-6868

1

participate in, really pretty much just had to file

2

something if they were let in the door in a timely fashion,

3

and they would've participated, including the NAACP for

4

example and the school districts.

5

So I think -- look, clearly it is up to the

6

Canadian court in it's -- in response to a motion for final

7

recognition to decide this issue.

8

should be clear that there was no exclusion of the Canadian

9

Municipal Creditors and First Nations Creditors from that

But I think the record

10

process, and the process was a lynchpin of this plan.

11

now reopen it would be, I think, impossible to bring other

12

parties into it.

13

To

On the other hand, the class in which the Canadian

14

Creditors were classified, voted to accept the plan, and I

15

don't -- I have no evidence that they're -- even setting

16

aside that they -- because of that vote this is irrelevant

17

to me legally, under the Bankruptcy Code it might be

18

relevant to a Canadian court of recognition.

19

but there's no evidence that they're getting a worse deal

20

than if they had been included in the trust structure.

21

They're getting their pro rata share of $15 million in cash

22

right away that wouldn't happen but for, I believe, the

23

other aspects of the plan.

24
25

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I don't know,

I think, Your Honor, I just want

to make clear that at least the Canadian Creditors view this

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 134
1

as a conscious choice by the Debtors in the manner which

2

they classified these Creditors.

3

impossible to say how the mediation might have ended.

4

never even started, and that again there was a conscious

5

choice by someone other than this Creditor.

6

And ultimately, it's
It

So, ultimately -- I don't want to necessarily

7

belabor this point any further, but it does raise the

8

ultimate implication, which is an issue for this Court and

9

for the United States, which is it would not be a good thing

10

generally for the Canadian (indiscernible) to accept this

11

Court's confirmation of a plan.

12

regard to this case, there is no question that that outcome

13

would affect the implementation, I think, of the plan.

14

it is material, I think, in a larger perspective.

15

willing to move onto jurisdiction.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. UNDERWOOD:

And specifically with

So

I'm

Okay.
And essentially, with regard to

18

that -- and even there, it's still a release issue, I

19

suppose.

20

talking about is under (indiscernible) Petroleum Network,

21

and I'm sure you're more familiar with the case than I am,

22

what these (indiscernible) are affecting is an involuntary

23

release of a foreign sovereign's, effectively, claims

24

against the U.S. Debtor.

25

Because what we're really talking -- what I'm

Now, in terms of those claims, the proof of claims

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 135
1

attached complaints that assert fraud, public, nuisance, a

2

variety of forms of relief.

3

forms of relief that are sought by United States

4

municipalities.

And those are the very same

5

In terms of the jurisdiction of this Court to

6

enter a nonconsensual release under Section 1141 of the

7

Bankruptcy Code, I think there is fundamentally -- and this

8

is absolutely without offense to the Court, but I think that

9

there is a jurisdictional question at the outset of whether

10

a non-Article 3 judge actually has that authority.

11

I'll pull very quickly back to the second aspect

12

of this issue, which is, all right, we all agree about what

13

Section 106 specifically says, but what was it really

14

intended to do and what does it really mean in this case?

15

And are there other statutes that abrogate 106 for the very

16

specific purposes of this case?

17

106, the Debtors, who really don't cite any case law or

18

analysis of 106, I think -- I think the way that I look at

19

106 and the way other courts have looked at Section 106 is

20

that it is to preserve defensive rights.

And I think in terms of

21

Meaning preserve avoidance actions, preserve, you

22

know, separate Debtor actions against foreign sovereigns so

23

that they can't sneak in and sneak out of the court without

24

having full relief on both sides.

25

stated earlier, there is no -- there are no such claims that

212-267-6868

But I think here, as I

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 136
1

have been asserted.

2

-- ultimately, the way that the foreign sovereignty immunity

3

statute actually trumps Section 106 in the Code.

4

frank, I couldn't find any law on that either way.

5

So ultimately, with regard to 106, the

To be

And maybe Davis Polk can correct me on that, but

6

ultimately there is no exception under the Foreign Sovereign

7

Immunities Act that would otherwise apply here.

8

than filing a claim, which unquestionably my clients had to

9

do, wanted to do, they wanted to participate in this case,

So other

10

it was important that they did it because, frankly, Canadian

11

assets are affected by the proceedings before this Court,

12

and there's no denying that.

13

I think ultimately there's a real question here

14

about whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, under

15

this very specific factual circumstance, may trump the plain

16

language of Section 106.

17

here is really the relationship between two countries, and

18

I'm certain that the people of Canada will not be happy when

19

they come to understand that there is an entire abatement

20

procedure that they were effectively left out of.

21

that is what it is, but that's fundamentally, I think the

22

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act jurisdictional Section 106

23

issue before this Court.

24

that in some fashion.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Because what we're talking about

Maybe

And I hope I was able to frame

Well --

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 137

2

MR. UNDERWOOD:

And we'll certainly raise it on an

objection.

3

THE COURT:

I understand your objection, and I

4

think it really comes down to the Court's, the Circuit

5

Court's, analysis of, first, what is being done when a plan

6

does enjoin the prosecution of a third-party claim; and

7

secondly, whether, by its plain terms, 106(a)(1) and (b)

8

permit that with regard to an entity, a governmental entity

9

that has sovereign immunity.

10

But I will note, though, that the injunction is,

11

as argued by the Debtors and their allies, the committee and

12

the other ad hoc groups that are supporting the plan, serve

13

an integral role enabling any recovery under the plan,

14

including the recovery in Class 11, which is what your

15

clients would have.

16

And again, as far as participating in an abatement

17

program, the -- I have no -- nothing to suggest that the pro

18

rata share of the Class 11 consideration that would flow to

19

the Canadian Creditors that you represent would be anything

20

less than the value of the abatement program that would flow

21

to them, which is, you know, obviously something that, I

22

mean, directly flow to them.

23

across the border from a state or municipality that has that

24

type of program, there would be some indirect effect, as was

25

testified.

212-267-6868

To the extent they're right

But notwithstanding the size of the value that's

516-608-2400

Page 138
1

going into the NOAT and Native American tribes' trusts, when

2

you look at the denominator, if you added your client's

3

claims to it, it's quite possible to me that, even if they

4

had asked to participate in the mediation, and had been

5

included in the procedures, these creditors wouldn't have

6

any aliquot share of that abatement program that would come

7

close to their pro rata share of the cash that they're

8

getting right away that they can themselves apply to

9

abatement.

10

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I think, Your Honor -- and it's a

11

funny thing because I have always said I would never, ever

12

listen to a client who says -- that says to me that it's

13

just about money.

14

we cannot say because there never was an allocation to

15

Canada as to what it might have received as to these claims.

16

But that be -- I would also say that, and sincerely, very

17

sincerely, the municipalities and First Nation's interests

18

in the Class 4 and 5 programs wasn't just money.

19

genuinely interested in the other aspects of the abatement

20

programs that they are also not partaking in.

21

This isn't just about money, and I think

THE COURT:

They were

Well, they have every opportunity to

22

use those programs as a model for their own use of the money

23

that they're getting, and frankly to -- if they -- if there

24

are other municipalities that would oppose that, try to

25

convince the court in Canada that the condition of

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 139
1

recognition is that the recoveries by Canadian creditors be

2

used towards abatement.

3

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I -- I'm sure that someone will

4

make those arguments in Canada before the NCAA.

5

concern also is that the result of this confirmed plan will

6

be, to a degree potentially, a handcuffing of the Canadian

7

Creditors to recover presuming that they are locked out of

8

any recovery against the U.S. assets.

I guess my

that everyone in this case has done to achieve any kind of

MR. TOBAK:

And I
I

Okay.
Thank you.
All right.

Any rebuttal?
The first point

19

I'll note -- and this is Mark TOBAK, Davis Polk for the

20

Debtors, is that oddity that we had earlier in argument that

21

it was illegal for the Debtors to classify states in the

22

United States together with the municipalities of counties

23

within that state.

24

apparently illegal for the Debtors to classify cities in an

25

entirely different country separately from the states and

212-267-6868

And now we have an argument that it is

the point of, you know, it was asked many times why the

MR. TOBAK:

Your Honor, I apologize for that.

18

THE COURT:

That's fine.

19

MR. TOBAK:

In any event, the point is that Canada

20

is a separate country, and that's fundamentally important

21

for many reasons.

22

Honor's already noted, is that there is an independent

23

company, an IAC, in Canada called Purdue Canada, and that

24

entity sells and markets pharmaceuticals in Canada.

25

importance of the border, which Mr. Underwood asked about,

212-267-6868

The most important reason, as Your

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

The

516-608-2400

Page 142
1

is particularly important in the context of highly regulated

2

pharmaceutical products which are subject to a great deal of

3

regulation in the United States, an entirely separate regime

4

of regulation in Canada under that country's laws.

5

why Perdue Pharma does business in the United States and not

6

in Canada.

7

That is

To the point of the Canadian municipalities'

8

desire to participate in an allocation and abatement scheme,

9

fundamentally we hope, as Your Honor has already noted, that

10

perhaps this plan of confirm can be used as a model for a

11

similar scheme in Canada with respect to Canadian

12

municipalities and assets of the Canadian company.

13

I will note, however, that in this plan here, the

14

testimony is that it has taken literally years, including

15

years before Perdue filed for bankruptcy, to develop this

16

plan and to develop an abatement model that was targeted to

17

the communities in this country.

18

inappropriate to attempt to in-graph that model into

19

different communities in the different country under

20

different legal regimes with different allocations of

21

national, provincial, and local responsibilities, and to

22

address different conduct by different companies and solve

23

the different needs.

24
25

It would be entirely

With respect to the jurisdictional point, I think
it can't really be said better than 106(a), which

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 143
1

specifically provides that it abrogates the sovereign

2

immunity of any governmental entity, including a foreign

3

state with respect to Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code.

4

can't find in the Code any suggestion that it is limited

5

only to the assertion of a counter claim by a Debtor.

6

I

As Your Honor also noted, the jurisdictional basis

7

for this proceeding is a simple, Section 1334, and this is

8

on the basis of any other aspect of a plan being confirmed.

9

With respect to whether there's any case holding that

10

sovereign immunity is abrogated by Section 106, one case is

11

the In re RMS Titanic case, which is at 569 B.R. 825 from

12

the Middle District of Florida 2017 which states that

13

pursuant to Section 106(a), foreign states can no longer

14

assert sovereign immunity from liability under the

15

Bankruptcy Code.

16

And then it notes that Section 106 abrogates

17

sovereign immunity as to a governmental unit.

18

several cases.

19

other bankruptcy courts across the country.

20

really all there is to say with respect to sovereign

21

immunity other than, also, the fundamental point that the

22

municipalities and First Nations did come to this court and

23

seek to participate in this proceeding, which is also a

24

waiver of whatever immunity they might have had otherwise.

25

4
5

No, I think that's fine.

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Your Honor, may I make one comment

as to the reference to the RMS Titanic case?

6

THE COURT:

Sure.

7

MR. UNDERWOOD:

And I think it came through in

8

what counsel said.

The RMS Titanic case refers to the

9

liability of a foreign sovereign.

It doesn't refer to the

10

taking of a right, and I'll rest on that, and I appreciate

11

it.

Thank you.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

Thank you.

All right.

13

14

Does it make sense to take a break for lunch?

It's

think, objection up next, then insurers, then pro ses, and

19

then whatever miscellaneous matters are remaining with

inconsistent with one of the words on the page, which is

7

there is no release of tax liability.

we could strike the word income.

MR. TOBAK:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

For the

record, it’s Marc Tobak from Davis Polk for the Debtors.

13

Reserving most of our time for rebuttal, I want to

14

make two points with respect to the objections by Mr. Bloyd,

15

Ms. Bridges, and Mr. Fitch to notice provided to

16

incarcerated unknown claimants.

17

And the fundamental point, Your Honor, is that

18

this is not their objection to raise.

19

that they were not provided with the adequate notice, and

20

they can’t.

21

They do not argue

That would be contradicted by the facts.

4

And we have been in contact

So their objection to notice is raised on behalf

5

of other parties who, as far as we were aware, Mr. Ozment

6

does not represent in this proceeding, and as far as we are

7

aware, not before the Court.

8

therefore, lack standing to assert the rights of other

9

parties in attempt to thwart confirmation of the plan.

10

Mr. Ozment’s clients,

And I quote from the Second Circuit’s opinion in

11

Kane v. Johns-Manville, which is 843 F2.d 636 at 642,

12

“Generally, litigants in federal court are barred from

13

15

precludes Mr. Ozment’s clients from raising the alleged

almost an exact parallel here.

18

I wrote this one down.

19

In Mullane v. Central Hanover, the court

20

recognized that due process requires a debtor to give notice

21

to a creditor before the creditor’s claims could be

22

extinguished.

And if this were a case about promissory notes and the

too many creditors in prison, or at least in federal prison

4

While Ms. Pullo I think gave very good testimony

5

and certainly put some of my concerns (indiscernible) notice

7

the Debtors did very little to alert prisoners in particular

8

about the need to file claims.

9

This is particularly unfortunate in this case --

10

and this goes somewhat to Mr. Bloyd’s objection, Your Honor

11

-- because victims should have been lienholders under the

12

Mandatory Victims Restitution Act.

13

the Debtor basically agreed that victims would not get their

14

rights under the MVRA because it would take too long to

15

figure out who they were or just generally to calculate what

16

they would receive.

You’re on mute.

13

the treatment of personal injury claimants under the TDPs.

14

MR. SHORE:

Two points, Your Honor.

It’s Chris

15

Shore from White & Case on behalf of the Ad Hoc Group of

16

personal injury victims, which includes 55,000 individuals,

17

including incarcerated individuals.

18

It’s unclear to me what the status is of the full

19

objection.

20

to address the class proof of claim issue because I think to

21

some extent what is happening today, or if the Court

22

confirms the plan is going to affect the class claims

23

status.

24

somehow either of the TDPs is disproportionally unfavorable

25

to incarcerated individuals or otherwise does not take into

Two, to address the claims and the objections that

2

On the first point, the TDPs, which are plan

3

supplements -- I think the 16th plan supplement was just

4

filed -- the Court will be approving those.

5

that anybody who receives money from the TDP has an

6

individual proof of claim on file.

7

Those require

So while Mr. Ozment is saying he wants to reserve

8

the right to seek class treatment, he hasn’t done it yet.

9

And if you -- without getting too far into it, the Musicland

10

factors that would go into whether or not that claim would

11

be filed, it would certainly be our position that the

12

allowance of a class proof of claim, which would, according

13

to the papers, take the personal injury class from 135,000

14

individuals to 1.5 million individuals, would affect the

15

administration of the estate going forward because the whole

16

TDP gets upended, distributions are made uncertain, and

17

you’re going to have to change a central feature of the TDP,

18

which is that it’s being done on an individualized basis.

19

So, you know, while I appreciate he’s not pressing

20

and not seeking today class treatment for the claims, we are

21

going to have some distinct views with respect to whether

22

that would ever be appropriate.

23

But to be clear, I don’t think the objection is

24

that the TDPs as drafted were drafted in bad faith.

25

the point Mr. Ozment was making in the objection was it

212-267-6868

I think

Page 157

doesn’t take into consideration the unique facts of

2

incarcerated individuals.

3

And I hope Your Honor can see from the TDPs and

4

what have been said about them, there was a great deal of

5

thought and effort that was put into balancing the due

6

process issues on the one hand with code requirements and

7

the need to get money out to individuals in a timely

fashion.

Even so, there are provisions in the TDP which

17

allow individuals with late filed claims to either come to

20

discretion to allow the claim as timely.

Your Honor, may I briefly address

that?

shall I just hear briefly from Mr. Ozment?

8
9

With regard to

notice, while Your Honor’s ruling with respect to standing

probably disposes of the issue, just given the importance of

11

notice and its scope of notice provided, I want to note just

12

two points if that’s appropriate right now.

13

The first is that under the law, constructive

claimants.

18

means such as publication or television or other forms of

21

notice by mail.

It’s not accurate to say that everyone who is

22

Secondly, in response to a question from Mr.

23

Ozment in the hearing, she testified that there was actual

24

specific outreach by mailings directed to prison outreach

25

organizations and to entities responsible for the management

of prison facilities, which is set forth in her testimony of

2

August 12th, 2021 at Transcript, Page 76, Lines 10 through

3

18.

4

And the third point builds off those two.

And on

5

the other hand, we don’t have any record evidence to support

6

Mr. Ozment’s and his clients’ assertions regarding the scope

7

of notice and what is or isn’t available in prisons.

8

while, again, we don’t doubt the sincerity of any of them or

9

in any way discount the importance of providing relief to

10

those who are incarcerated, on the other hand, there just

11

isn’t record evidence of those assertions.

12

we rest on our papers.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. OZMENT:

And

And with that,

Okay.
Your Honor, first, a quantitative

15

issue.

16

There are roughly 1.2 million in physical custody of state

17

prisons.

18

19

doesn’t mean that they product manufactured by Purdue.

we’re not talking about flooding the trust with those

claims.

22

This would not amount (indiscernible) the claims.

And, you know, roughly 20 percent of those
But that
So

With respect to the issue regarding trust

23

distribution procedures, we are not asking for relief on it.

24

As a practical matter, by the time a prisoner arrives in

25

prison as opposed to jail, the people who run those

correction facilities know pretty much everything there is

2

to know about them.

3

people have had an opioid use disorder, problem that’s well

known, and also perhaps even a level of what drug was it.

5

So, for example, you know, some drug courts will keep up

and it’s in order, you’re not totally wasting your time.

14

Your Honor, the Debtors have included a number of

15

findings and conclusions in the proposed confirmation order

16

that are necessary to preserve the value of the insured’s

17

rights being transferred to the MDT.

18

We provided Your Honor with a list of these

findings in Exhibit A in our joint reply to the insurer’s

confirmation objections, so I won’t read them word for word

unless you’d like me to.

22

provide that the settlements embodied in the plan are

23

reasonable and were negotiated in good faith, that the

insurers had notice and an opportunity to participate in the

25

negotiations, and that the negotiation and resolution of the

2

shall not excuse any insurer from its coverage obligations,

3

regardless of any contrary policy terms.

4

The purpose of these findings is to ensure that

5

nothing about the plan itself or the Debtor’s actions in

6

negotiating and proposing the plan diminishes the value of

7

the insurance assets being transferred to the MDT.

8

Now, certain of the Debtor’s insurers have argued
in their plan and confirmation objections that this Court

10

can’t issue these rulings.

be entitled to argue in coverage litigation that key

12

components of the plan release them from any and all

Their view is that they should

they seek is a determination that the insurers cannot

What

We would argue that that’s an issue that’s

That makes them core issues

not, for example, by a Bermuda arbitration panel considering

that’s the very reason Congress gave bankruptcy courts tools

I would also like to address briefly the insurers’

related issues (indiscernible) confirmation.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

And I have two

516-608-2400

responses to that.

The first is I think there is emphasis that not

9

The Babcock case we cited in our reply

Second, these other cases cited by the insurers
are largely irrelevant because every case is different.

I

10

can’t really speak to the specific considerations at issue

11

in those cases, but I can tell you that the findings the

12

Debtors seek here are critically important to this plan

13

because of its unique abatement-based trust structure.

14

If you look at the more traditional asbestos trust

15

structures, claims typically are channeled to a trust, and

16

then the trust liquidates and pays individual claimants post

17

confirmation.

18

(indiscernible) about what the claims were worth or whether

19

the trust’s award was reasonable, the parties would have an

20

opportunity to litigate that dispute and its impact on the

21

coverage post-confirmation.

22

So in that scenario, if the insurers

But here, there is no post-confirmation

23

liquidation process for most of the creditors’ claims.

24

There is no point, for example, at which NOAD is going to be

25

So there’s really no other

5

this Court’s ruling on these issues should be binding on the

So that’s why any

As Your Honor knows, we have addressed the

8

insurers’ objections to specific findings and conclusions in

9

our papers.

So in the interest of time, I’ll just address

11

16

the transfer and vesting of the MDT transferred assets

17

19

The objecting insurers have asserted that since

20

they previously notified the Debtors that they don’t object

21

to the transfer of the MDT insurance rights, the Court

22

shouldn’t render what they call an advisory ruling regarding

23

the Code’s authorization of such transfer.

24

propose a finding that basically says the objecting insurers

25

have not challenged the validity of the transfer.

She acknowledged on

2

So that brings me to the second point.

Why strike

Your Honor, I don’t know whether --

13

-- there was no clue that the Debtors would seek any

15

Debtors in connection with their mediation reached out to

the carriers, spoke to the carriers, consulted with the

carriers, sought the carriers’ consent to any settlement?

4

Your Honor has determined that whether or not

There’s only two other findings, and I’ll just go

5

through them really quickly.

One is a finding in Paragraph

I think we discussed this one in Paragraph

I think it was in Paragraph

10

that all parties, including the carriers, had notice of the

country.

16

mediated, negotiated, and resolved, that’s the sentence we

17

propose to have stricken.

18

until the adversary was filed, I don’t think the evidence

19

will show any carrier who had any reason to think there was

20

going to be any effort to get coverage here.

21

Grim may dispute that, but the evidence is not in front of

22

you, and the briefing is not in front of you, and it can be

resolved in the coverage (indiscernible).

The final provision, Your Honor, is I think in our

I’m skipping over the one

I see you’re

If I can be of help, happy to do so.

THE COURT:

Well, I guess I wanted to focus on the

7

language in JJA and the third sentence.

What’s being

8

referred to here is settlements of the opioid-related

9

claims.

It would seem to me that any insurer of an entity

10

that has opioid-relate liability, including the D&O insurer,

11

should be covered by this provision.

12

confining your remarks to insurers of companies that don’t

13

have opioid-related liability, right?

14
15

MR. ANKER:

And you’re just

Your Honor, you referred to the third

sentence of JJA, and I see two sentences.

16

THE COURT:

Well, the third clause.

Maybe it’s

17

the third clause.

You don’t like the phrase, you want to

18

strike the phrase, “Such negotiation, settlement, or

19

resolution of liability shall not operate to excuse any

20

insurer from its obligations under any insurance policy.”

21

MR. ANKER:

Correct, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

So -- so I understand that.

So I

think you are worried about the plan documents and any other
orders or rulings, including in the future.

Right?

11

MR. ANKER:

And the past.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

13

MR. ANKER:

Correct, Your Honor.

14

THE COURT:

And I can understand that if, you

15

know, the insurers didn’t have notice of those issues.

16

maybe it should be dealt with that way.

17

as I’m concerned, what they’re asking me to find and rule on

18

is what we’re just been talking about for the last half hour

19

or so.

20

of law provisions that we’ve been discussing.

21

actually -- and I don’t believe this is the case -- sought

22

something from the Court that was not on notice to your

23

clients, it couldn’t be encompassed by that language because

24

you wouldn’t have notice of it.

25

be clarified, it should be.

212-267-6868

And

I’m not -- as far

It’s the proposed findings of fact and conclusions
And if they

And if that’s what needs to

I mean, I just don’t -- that

should be an easy fix.

2

MR. ANKER:

Your Honor, I think it is an easy fix

3

if it’s limited to the plan and the confirmation order.

4

let me -- what I’m looking at.

5

the plan documents.

6

them, when we’re going to have an opportunity to look at

7

them.

8

entered by the bankruptcy court without any temporary

9

limitation, without any language about notice on us.

But

First, I am concerned about

I don’t know what’s going to be in

But going back in time, it says under any order

That

10

would include any order you entered at the outset of the

11

case before the adversary --

12

THE COURT:

I understand.

But that has to be

13

qualified by notice, obviously.

I mean, Mr. Singer’s point

14

is insurers can’t sit back and say everything that happens

15

in a bankruptcy case on notice to us doesn’t matter.

16

know, the normal rules of judicial estoppel, collateral

17

estoppel, and law of the case just don’t matter for

18

insurers.

19

principles all require notice.

20

MR. ANKER:

That’s just -- that’s not right.

You

But those

So that could be --

And, Your Honor, I think that can be

21

fixed with a notice provision, adequate notice.

22

Your Honor, there’s a lot of law on whether findings in a

23

contested matter are in fact res judicata for purposes of a

24

future adversary.

25

later.

212-267-6868

I will say,

That’s an issue we can brief with you

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 197
1

But I will say, Your Honor, let me go back to this

2

provision for a moment.

Why can’t we have the language that

3

was there when the plan went out that the creditors wrote it

4

on?

This is a last second change.

5

THE COURT:

But it’s not a last second change.

6

You all have been able to blackline the proposed order, for

7

example.

8

Mr. Singer have been living these issues in multiple cases.

9

You know the caselaw.

I mean, you -- as you said, you and Ms. Grim and

You know the issues.

This is not

10

really a surprise here.

11

then you have the potential for the coverage exclusions.

12

And I don’t think that’s right given the record as far as

13

the transfer.

14
15

And I think, although I will double check the
caselaw with regard to the pay first and consent points --

16
17

And if you just have that language,

MR. ANKER:

Your Honor, this is not a pay -- I

want to make sure we’re drawing issues --

18

THE COURT:

I understand.

But that’s why I don’t

19

think it really matters.

20

consent really matters, either.

21

claims are being settled, they will only be settled in this

22

context.

They will be settled for a lot worse in some other

23

context.

So what -- the deletion of this language would

24

mean that the insurers could go -- could raise this whole

25

issue, that we’ve had six days of trial and two days of oral

212-267-6868

And, frankly, I don’t think the

argument on as to whether the settlement is proper or not

2

all over again.

That just doesn’t make sense.

3

MR. ANKER:

Your Honor --

4

THE COURT:

And I think the underlying principle

5

is right, that in bankruptcy it’s a collective proceeding.

6

The insurers’ rights are to object on the context of the

7

collective proceeding.

8

these settlements were on their backs properly or

9

improperly, they would have objected.

10

raised their voice.

And if they really believed that

They would have

And they’ve just not.

11

MR. ANKER:

So, Your Honor --

12

THE COURT:

I mean, their issues are much more

13

narrow, primarily.

They’re basically saying we didn’t cover

14

this sort of stuff.

15

did.

16

where they’re asking for a finding that there’s X degree of

17

insurance coverage that actually applies to these claims.

18

They’re not seeking that relief.

19

settlements that if I approve them, I will find are

20

reasonable on notice to the insurers, the insurers coming

21

back and saying no, we have to relitigate that whole thing.

22

And to me that just is not right.

And the settlement doesn’t say they

This is not a -- this is very different from a case

23

MR. ANKER:

They just want to prevent

I understand Your Honor’s position.

24

Do I understand correctly that either we’ll have the words

25

“viewed collectively” added or at as clear to Your Honor

212-267-6868

Page 199
1

that this is not specific to -- is not a finding with

2

respect to Rhodes --

3

THE COURT:

4

It’s to all the debtors.

It says

debtors, plural.

5

MR. ANKER:

That’s correct.

6

THE COURT:

We’re not allocating, you know, X to

7

one debtor and Y to another.

But at the same time, I don’t

8

-- I think that the language that insurers have proposed be

9

stricken really should stay, because it’s -- I think under

10

these circumstances, isn’t a settlement that is being

11

proposed to be funded primarily by the insurers.

12

the evidence suggests -- Mr. Huebner’s presentation today

13

was exclusive of insurance.

14

think all things considered, I understand why the insurers

15

haven’t objected, because to them it’s -- it actually

16

ensures that, frankly, as much money as possible goes out to

17

reduce their potential liability.

18

MR. ANKER:

So that was on top.

In fact,

And so I

the language should remain in Paragraph JJA.

that are --

THE COURT:

Does Your

Well, I don’t really agree with them.

23

I just think, again, I think there should be a reference to

24

the withdrawal of the objections.

25

that’s an important aspect of the record.

212-267-6868

That’s fine.

Veritext Legal Solutions

I think

And that may well

516-608-2400

help you in your concern about precedent, although I don’t

2

think what we’re dealing with here involves insurance of

3

non-debtors being used to pay debtor obligations.

4

think the objection should be noted and the withdrawal of

5

objections and the lack of objections by any others.

6

MR. ANKER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

7

THE COURT:

Okay.

Okay.

But I

And as far as the

8

language in the plan itself, I mean, I think I’ve been

9

clear.

If the Debtors or the MDT try to alter the insurers’

10

rights other than as set forth in the findings of fact or in

11

the confirmation order itself or in the plan documents that

12

you have, without due notice, you just can’t -- that’s not

13

operative.

That can’t be operative.

14

MR. ANKER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

15

THE COURT:

I don’t know how you word that.

I

16

imagine you’ll probably come up with some language to cover

17

that.

18

if you can’t in the next day or so come up with that

19

language, I think the record is clear that, you know, you

20

can’t have super-secret probation.

But it’s basically a fundamental principle.

21

MR. ANKER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

23

Thank all three of you.

I do, that is.

24
25

Okay.

So even

MS. GRIM:

Your Honor, may I have the opportunity

to address a few of Mr. Anker’s points?

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 201
1

THE COURT:

2

MS. GRIM:

Sure.

I’m sorry.

Go ahead.

On Mr. Anker’s point as to why are we

3

here, I just want to reiterate I think we’ve made it pretty

4

clear that we’re here because the insurers have made it

5

clear that they seek to negate coverage solely based on the

6

plan.

7

aspect of the plan, that we need these findings to preserve

8

the value of the MDT insurance rights.

And even if Mr. Anker agrees not to object to any

9

Mr. Anker is correct and we agree, the recovery of

10

proceeds is not a predicate to confirmation, but transfer of

11

the insurance rights is a predicate.

12

to access those rights without having the transfer itself or

13

any other aspects of the plan vitiates coverage is also a

14

predicate.

15

that may impede the Debtor’s ability to implement this plan.

16

I also need to address Mr. Anker’s suggestion that

And the MDT’s ability

17

our firm, Gilbert, is seeking confirmation findings solely

18

for precedent in other cases.

THE COURT:

Because, frankly --

Well, it wouldn’t work anyways.

So

that’s fine.

21

But I just want to -- again, can I go back to

something?

MS. GRIM:

No, Your Honor.

And I know certain

2

insurers raised some concerns regarding -- I believe it was

3

the definition of the MDT insurance rights or the schedule

4

that listed certain policies that fall within that

5

definition.

6

presupposing that those policies provide coverage for the

7

opioid liabilities.

8

give Mr. Anker heartburn, I think he’s had a number of weeks

9

now to raise them.

We want to make clear the plan is not

You know, if any of these provisions

We have addressed other concerns by

10

other objecting insurers to clarify language, that we’re not

11

trying to do that.

12
13

So I think what you see is what you get here.

We

are seeking the findings that we are seeking.

THE COURT:

MS. GRIM:

THE COURT:

MS. GRIM:

And that’s it.
Okay.

I do think it’s important, if I could

18

just have two minutes to address his due process arguments.

19

And I don’t want to drag this out, but I do think it’s

20

important to correct the record on this.

21

conversations about the scope and intent of this provision,

22

starting back on May 9th.

23

Debtors made clear from the get-go even with the old

24

language that the intent was to preserve the same rights and

25

obligations the insurers and debtors had under the policies

say that they were taken off guard.

7

- and I’m not going to beat a dead horse on this because I

think Your Honor made the point effectively -- what exactly

have the insurers been deprived of?

The insurers expressed

believe we provided these confirmation order findings back

15

on August 11th, which might have been before the Court even

had them, although Debtor counsel can correct me on that.

So, again, I just need to correct the record on that point.

happy to address those.

understanding of this plan is that the new company will be

So your answer is -- again, depends on how you

5

define the word continuing.

I think it’s quite clear -- and

6

the Debtors already have represented and the monitors have I

7

think made this clear -- that whatever marketing practices

8

that Purdue had that have been alleged to have flooded the

9

country with opioids, of just its opioids, will not -- has

10

not and will not be occurring, that the salesforce doesn’t

11

exist.

There is no salesforce.

12

So if you’ve been listening to the trial over the

13

last week or so, there is a balance for a regulated company

14

like this that sells products that are inherently dangerous

15

where nevertheless the regulators contend that they agree

16

that they are not prohibited and can be used for proper

17

purposes.

18

So it’s not going to stop selling opioids, but it

19

will not be selling them in a way that existed at least

20

through the period that it was marketing them with the

21

salesforce and trying to drive up prescriptions, et cetera.

22

But who am I?

Because this

I am someone who has had --

4

apparently I am the only on this list that’s willing to

5

speak to you today who has been through this.

6

like I have relevant life experience with this.

7

did work around, as I have indicated in my submissions,

8

drugs, you know, a lifetime ago.

9

trouble with the law.

But I feel
Because I

And I’ve never been in

I never did anything, you know,

10

illegal and all that kind of stuff while I was working.

11

way back in the eighties, you know, somehow people didn’t

12

need long-acting opiates to get their relief from pain.

13

when the Oxycontin was introduced by Purdue onto the market

14

and then pushed out by the doctors -- who I also hold highly

15

responsible, because one can’t function without the other.

16

That having taken these drugs for over 15 years and

17

survived, those long-acting opiates act completely different

18

than short-acting opiates.

19

But

And

And I know that there's a lot of testimony

20

concerning the diversion, that that's why they formulated

21

OxyContin the way they did, to prevent diversion, and it's

22

not 100 percent -- or however they adulterate it or

23

whatever.

I don't know.

24

I don't have a lot of experience with the illegal,

25

incarcerated, all that kind of stuff, but having taken those

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 209

drugs, when you're taking those long-acting drugs for

2

chronic pain -- and I'm not talking about acute pain -- I

3

think that these drugs are miracles to help people with

4

acute pain.

5

your individual ability to kind of manage your own pain.

6

But these long-acting drugs, they take away

You know, used to it was as-needed for pain.

Once

7

you get over that, you know, three to -- three days to 10

8

days of post-op or whatever the injury, or whatever it is,

9

and you kind of start to heal.

10

You know, you should be

decreasing the usage, and your pain should lessen.

11

And what they did to me was they just kind of --

12

and then they -- the doctors still give you the breakthrough

13

pain pills, and so either way you're getting a long acting

14

drug that's supposed to prevent you from abusing it, but

15

then they still give you the short-acting drugs to help with

16

the breakthrough pain because every time you take them and

17

if you're on a constant level, your tolerance is constantly

18

building up, and so you're just always building up this

19

tolerance to the drug, and your tolerance to the pain goes

20

way, way down.

21

And so it's a vicious snowball of psychic hell

that happens on these drugs.

notes here.

2

It's the risk of reinjury.

That's what I was

3

going to say.

When you're taking those drugs just constant

4

long term, especially for chronic pain that you really need

5

to address in non-pharmaceutical ways if possible, which I

6

think the introduction of these drugs pushed like they were

7

onto the market prevented a lot of development of the

8

alternatives that, you know, could've been really developed

9

over the past 20 years rather than just relying on all these

opiates and then, you know, we're in the situation that

11

we're in.

12

But when you take opiates for pain and injury,

13

like I have a really bad back, and so it does take away that

14

(indiscernible) of the pain, and so you think you can do

15

stuff that you really shouldn't do it.

16

feeling less pain.

17

pain unless I was unconscious, but your pain is -- whatever

18

happens to you, you do -- you do more than you really should

19

do.

THE COURT:

No, no.

I think I understand your

It's really not that -- I never felt no

You don't allow yourself to heal so that you -- and you

THE COURT:
you can go ahead.

7

MS. MCGAHA:

Okay.

I think it delays healing,

anyway, the OxyContin especially.

8
9

Well, I don't get paid by the hour, so

I feel like the way that that was approved by the
FDA and all of the experts that have -- not all but a lot of

10

experts that approved these -- that regulate and approve

11

these decisions, I -- I mean, I just really kind of -- I

12

don't understand it because OxyContin -- no one should

13

really need constant opiate of OxyContin if they're still

14

going to get the short-acting drugs.

15

doesn't make sense to me.

I mean, it just

16

But I think I tried to make that point in my

17

submission also, that there's a symbiotic relationship

18

between the healthcare system and the pharmaceutical

19

industry.

20

people out here would not have been prescribed these drugs

21

if the doctors hadn't have been, you know, benefiting

22

somehow.

23

And it's like hand in glove, and the -- all these

And that, I feel like, is kind of a missing link

24

or whatever in this plan is that it -- I know this is a

25

pharmaceutical bankruptcy and all this kind of stuff, and I

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 212
1

just hope that whoever, you know, the state leaders or

2

whoever gets to introduce the solutions or decide how the

3

money's spent in each state remembers that people out here

4

like myself in, you know, Podunk USA where you have to drive

5

an hour just to get, you know, anywhere, and if you want to

6

go to a good -- a really good doctor, you're going to drive

7

three hours.

8
9

And so a lot of the solutions that I've outlined
in my submissions are alternatives that I personally have

10

been trying to use some of them on my own, but if they'd

11

have been more available, you know, years ago, if this had

12

not been offered as a solution, I would not have gone out on

13

the street and looked for illegal drugs to ease my pain.

14

I would've had to -- I mean, I was the type of

15

person -- I would've done what I -- you know, what the

16

doctor recommended, and I relied on those doctors to put my

17

best interests at heart and to, you know, follow their

18

Hippocratic Oath and not just get the country addicted to

19

opiates like that's the only solution.

20

I mean, you've got these task forces who know all

21

of this.

22

in these -- you know, out here in no man's land, it's a

23

different world, and the way that they're doing the funding

24

of the abatement programs, you know, and a lot of this, it

25

is based on population and the MMEs.

212-267-6868

All these doctors, they know this.

huge bureaucracies of these agencies who are going to -- you

5

there's not going to be very much left, and I know there's

all sorts of formulas that they go by and everything, and

that's kind of necessary.

that's just what I see, and that's what happens in rural

areas.

The drug-induced decline that we experienced over

11

the years, you know, people leave.

And they go to nice

12

areas, the big city where, you know, those places, their

13

population grows, and they get more money, and people leave

14

here because, you know, less money.

15

of -- the problem gets bigger, and it's all because of the

16

drugs.

And so it's just kind

And --

17

THE COURT:

Okay.

18

MS. MCGAHA:

I just wanted to say also that on the

19

unit dose thing, I tried to describe how that would've

20

helped me, and I feel like if they're going to continue to

21

sell especially OxyContin -- but I feel like all narcotics

22

should be in like a card.

23

I don't know if you're familiar with Accutane, but

24

it's a drug, and it's sold on a card so the you can see,

25

okay, I took that.

And that was one of my problems because for a long

other drugs.

I had 100 microgram

And so the doctors that prescribe these and the

10

doctors that are in the Sackler family and executives with

11

the pharmaceutical company, you know, they're uniquely

12

trained and credentialed to know the pharmacology and the

13

human anatomy and how all this kind of interacts.

14

know, they should've known the history of opium in this

15

country and, you know, for hundreds of years, the addiction

16

that can happen from it.

17

And you

But the side effects, you know, you get memory

18

loss and confusion, and then you combine that with Valium or

19

whatever, and it's just even worse.

20

remember, I mean, you're looking down the barrel of a bottle

21

of pills, and you can't tell how many are in there, and

22

you're in pain.

23

you know, we're depending on the doctor to not give us

24

something that really is going to harm us.

25

And so I can just

only one that could manage my drugs.

I was like the

2

healthcare drug expert in my family.

And you know, I didn't

3

do a very good job.

4

diverted my drugs or mis -- abused my drugs or did anything

5

like that, but there were times that I made my mistakes, and

6

one of those times caused me to almost die, and my children

found me.

the trauma that they went through, but that's beside the

point.

11

But the diversion that the Sacklers talk about

12

when they testified, like that's the biggest problem, which

13

I get that that is a big problem in this country.

14

before I even filed this claim, I had written letters to my

15

governor, and the attorney general, and my local sheriff

16

kind of similar to the things that I've written in my

17

submissions because I felt like the -- that's what I felt

18

like God was trying to tell me what to do.

19

But they kept talking about diversion.

In fact,

In this

20

case, you're only going to get paid money as a personal

21

injury person if you have proof, you know, medical records

22

and pharmacy records that you actually took these drugs,

23

from my understanding of it.

24

And so -- but it seems like all of these abatement

25

programs and a lot of the talk that the Sacklers had was all

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 216
1

about diversion, and they kept mentioning, you know, heroin

2

was on the rise anyway, and kind of like it was inevitable

3

that opiates were going to be a crisis, and if they knew

4

heroin was already on the rise, why they thought introducing

5

OxyContin and pushing all these drugs out onto the market

6

would be a great solution, I don't know.

7

I think that's negligence, and I think not putting

8

those drugs, knowing the side effects of those drugs on the

9

patients taking them and expecting those people to manage

10

the consumption of those drugs -- when you go in the

11

hospital, you know, the nurses chart every pill.

recovery from injury, and recover from all sorts of things

without being -- having it necessary to be put on long-

I hate to do this, Ms. McGaha, but I

3

back to things we've already discussed, and --

MS. MCGAHA:

I think we're now circling

Okay.
-- you discussed them quite clearly,

so I'm going to --

7

MS. MCGAHA:

Okay.

8

THE COURT:

9

I want to make two observations.

-- thank you.
First, the

10

abatement programs under this plan are not locked in stone,

11

except for the fact that the money has to be used for

12

abatement, so my hope is -- and I believe this is the hope

13

of the states, and local governments, and hospitals that had

14

a hand in putting together these abatement and treatment

15

programs is that people learn as they go along, and part of

16

the learning is going to come from the reports that have to

17

be filed in this case as to effectiveness of treatment and

18

the effectiveness of the abatement programs, how to do this

19

best.

20

And I think -- it is clear to me at least that

21

this -- that that task is a complicated one, but it includes

22

the ability of people like yourself, people who run

23

community groups, who run associations of both people who

24

themselves have suffered from opioid use disorder and their

25

relatives to have input, to speak to their councilmen, their

Page 218
1

mayor, their governor, and the local health authorities, to

2

give them their input.

3

obviously.

And I think that's important,

4

So this is not -- you know, I think this money is

5

to come in over a substantial amount of time, and it is not

6

going to -- if I confirm the plan -- always going to be a

7

2021 abatement program.

8

observations are important there.

Therefore, in my opinion, I don't agree with the

3

declaration of Jonathan Greville White on page 4, Article 9,

which states "Beacon Trust, one of the general trusts is the

5

According to LexisNexis and the Bloomberg Law on

5

December 17th, 2019 at 6:09 p.m., Samantha Stokes wrote,

6

"Purdue Pharma has paid several big law firms for the legal

7

work on behalf of the Sackler family members, including

8

Debevoise, McDermott and Norton Rose, according to new

9

documents" and "Purdue Pharma, the embattled pharmaceutical

10

company at the center of the opioid crisis has paid more

11

than 17.5 million in legal fees on behalf of the Sackler

12

family to more than a dozen law firms, according to the new

13

documents filed in the company's bankruptcy. Debevoise &

14

Plimpton was paid the majority of the legal spend, more than

15

11.4 million for its legal work for the Sacklers from the

16

first half of 2018 through 2018 through early 2019 according

17

to an audit filed Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the

18

Southern District of New York where the company is

20

If the Sackler family used the money that they

21

spent on attorneys instead of for themselves -- instead of

22

themselves, all parties would be happier.

Are the Sacklers and their lawyers at Davis Polk

3

and Wardwell willing to clone my dear son or bring him back

4

to help me in my disabled old feeble age?

5

thank you, Your Honor.

6

THE COURT:

All right.

I don't think so.

And thank you, Ms. Ecke.

7

I will say just one point, and that is that it obviously

8

took a lot of courage to say what you've said in this

9

setting.

I some people will disagree with it, and I think

10

there are some points that just weren't right like Davis

11

Polk being the Sacklers' lawyers, which is not true.

12

the other hand, what comes through very clearly is I think

13

the main point of your objection and your statement, which

14

is that this company's product or products caused tremendous

15

pain and harm.

16

But on

And it is turning over all of its assets under

17

this plan in a way that the parties interested in the case

18

have determined best resolves that pain and harm knowing

19

full well that it never can resolve that pain and harm, and

20

that is something that will never be fully resolved or even

21

partially resolved.

22

THE COURT:

All right.

We had reserved time at

23

the end of this argument for miscellaneous matters,

24

including further discussion of the release language in the

25

plan.

I don't know whether there is a remaining argument on

the DMP issues or not.

2

MR. GLEIT:

Your Honor, Jeff Gleit of Sullivan and

3

Worcester.

I have a -- just a brief statement that I'd like

4

to make in connection with it, and I'm available to answer

5

any questions you have.

6

THE COURT:

Okay.

That's fine.

7

MR. GLEIT:

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

On

8

Monday morning, Ms. Duvani had stated that the Debtors, the

9

AHC, and the DMPs reached a settlement in connection with

10

substantially all of the DMPs objections.

11

narrow exception, that is the objection that the insured

12

injunction improperly deprived certain DMPs of their rights

13

as additional insureds under the DMVT insurance policies.

14

With regard to that objection, the DMPs have agreed to rest

15

on their papers, which can be found at docket 3306.

16

The plan with one

I'd like to make just one brief point, which is

17

not in my firm's reply brief but is addressed in Davis

18

Polk's brief, which is at docket number 3461 at paragraph

19

206.

20

the plan contains multiple settlements and transactions, all

21

of which must be approved for this plan to be consummated.

22

As I'm sure Your Honor's aware, the MVT insurance -- insurer

23

injunction is one of these essential and integrated

24

provisions.

As we've heard throughout this confirmation hearing,

25

The Debtor's insurance policies, the rights to

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

1

which are being transferred to the master disbursement

2

trust, provide a substantial source of value for the

3

abatement distributions and the distributions the personal

4

injury claimants contemplated to be made under the plan.

5

The MVT insured injunction is essential to preserving and

6

ultimately realizing the value.

7

and its applicability to the DMPs is necessary for this plan

8

to be consummated.

9

It is integral to the plan,

Absent questions from Your Honor, I will not

10

repeat the arguments which are fully set forth in the briefs

11

of my firm, Davis Polk's firm -- the Davis Polk firm, and

12

the AHC which are located at docket numbers 3506, 3461, and

13

3465 respectively.

14

that there was a joint stipulation between the Debtors and

15

the DMPs which was filed at docket number 3612, which

16

contains excerpts from the relevant insurance provisions in

17

the parties' contracts, which the Court may find helpful.

11

there was still, in light of those revisions, an issue as to

And obviously this is without prejudice to

releases.

However, we have had several conversations with

2

Mr. Edmunds of Maryland that I think have been helpful in

3

clarifying his understanding of how the releases function.

4

And so I'm happy to walk Your Honor and other parties

5

through those issues so that hopefully everybody else can

6

share that understanding, if that would be helpful.

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. VONNEGUT:

9

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

That's fine.

So a number of the questions

about the releases that we've gotten this week from Mr.

10

Edmunds I think are premised on some misunderstandings of

11

how they work, so I'd just like to clarify a couple of

12

foundational issues about what is in and what is out.

13

First, there have been a number of references to

14

conduct that is described as unlawful asking whether claims

15

arising from unlawful conduct would not be released.

16

one is very simple.

17

claims is criminal claims.

18

released, period, full stop.

19

and what we have had extensive discussions with Mr. Edmunds

20

about is capacity limitations.

21

That

The very first provision of excluded
Criminal claims are not being
What is a little bit harder

So a variety of parties that received revisions

22

under the plan only received those releases for claims

23

against them in their specified capacities.

24

instance, with respect to related parties of the Debtor that

25

Mr. Edmunds raised, there were a couple of questions along

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

So for

516-608-2400

Page 231
1

the lines of if some participant in the pharmaceutical

2

industry had a relationship with the Debtor, do they become

3

released for all claims against them, and the answer is no.

4

The only claims that are released that party are claims

5

against them in their capacity with which they were related

6

to the Debtor.

7

A similar limitation, which we've discussed before

8

but I think it bears emphasis because it's important, is

9

that parties are only released for claims that relate to the

10

Debtor.

11

it's not the case that if you have one claim against you

12

released because it is related to the Debtor that other

13

claims become released.

14

limited capacity.

15

the Debtor and then independent conduct, claims arising from

16

the independent conduct is not released.

17

So they have to be tied to the Debtor.

And again,

You are only released in that

So if a party had one relationship with

Now, the most important issue that we discussed

18

with Mr. Edmunds that I think is important to emphasize is a

19

revision that we made in response to Your Honor's commentary

20

on Monday's hearing regarding the settlement with the

21

distributors, manufacturers, and pharmacies, the DMPs.

22

we had some colloquy about whether those parties are

23

included in the third-party releases.

24

we've now made that very clear in Section 10.6B, which is

25

the third-party release provision as distinct from the

212-267-6868

So

The answer is no, and

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 232
1

releases of claims held by the Debtors.

2

So we've now added to Section 10.6B a footnote

3

that says co-defendants are not released parties under

4

Section 10.6B of the plan.

5

discussed with Mr. Edmunds, we believe that this addresses a

6

lot of the concerns and the confusion that have been raised

regarding the scope of the releases here.

that we're working on, but recipients of releases are still

obligated to comply with subpoenas and other discovery.

We're not attempting to relieve them of that obligation.

18

And that will be made clear in the next amended plan.

Mr. Edmunds also raised the question of whether

2

it as we agreed over the lunch hour that we took when Mr.

3

Huebner, Mr. Vonnegut and I were on the call to resolve it.

4

But let me just -- the issue narrowly that I have

5

been raising and on behalf of other objecting states have

6

been raising is that the -- is the same one that you went

7

over Monday, which is that the definition of related

8

parties, specifically Debtor-related parties who were

9

released under 10.6B is very broad.

And we -- the position,

10

our position, is that those releases are inappropriate if

11

they release people who independently, who are not closely

12

connected with the Debtors, those who have independently

13

engaged in conduct, including conduct that involves the

marking and sale of produced opioids.

MR. EDMUNDS:

Right.
-- which is the issue here.

And

12

that could be very broad, and that's as literally

13

incorporated as it's broad.

14

this is a new understanding that I understood Mr. Huebner

15

was going to clarify this afternoon on the record, which is

16

that those actors, the related parties who, in their own

17

right, engaged in the same misconduct related to Purdue

18

should not be released and are released, they are arguably

19

partially incorporated in -- if you go through a string of

definitions, the definition of co-defendants.

MR. EDMUNDS:

I think that we have agreed.

I

13

thought it was going to be made clearer on the record.

14

think that there is still an issue that needs to be that --

15

and Mr. Vonnegut and I have been discussing this by email

during the hearing this afternoon.

17

something -- some work that we still need to do, and I think

18

that we will be able to do that.

19

I think that there is

But I wanted to -- we may not be arguing before

20

the Court again on this issue, so I wanted to explain

overall what the issue is that we are trying to resolve, and

that is that wrongdoers shouldn't be released from state

25

principle as to that.

And I think that we're -- there is an agreement in

I think we need to make sure that the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 237

language is -- it incorporates that and is clear.

2

because I think we'll face interpretive questions over that

3

if it's not in implementing our police powers.

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. EDMUNDS:

6

And clear

So --

Well --- that's the concern, and I think

--

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. EDMUNDS:

9

THE COURT:

All right.
-- we can work on that.
I want to be clear, though.

I think

10

that I heard from Mr. Vonnegut that there was an agreement

11

generally on that point.

12

certain causes of action that the Debtor has, such as, you

13

know, failed to supervise vicarious liability, veil-piercing

14

alter ego, things like that where a discharge of the Debtor,

15

if someone was acting just without wrongdoing, you know,

16

without their own knowledge of unlawful conduct, really

17

shouldn't be a back door to violate the bankruptcy discharge

18

or the injunction from those who were contributing.

19

But on the other hand there are

So that's where I draw the line.

And it really

20

should go truly to their own independent wrongful conduct,

21

not conduct as, you know, an employee of the Debtor, just as

22

an employee of the Debtor.

23

language in Section 524(g)(4), you know, which provides for

24

an injunction of claims related to the Debtor based on the

25

third-party's involvement in the management of the Debtor or

212-267-6868

And this is similar to the

516-608-2400

Page 238
1

predecessor to the Debtor, or services as an officer or

2

director or employee.

3

So those types of claims really shouldn't -- I

4

view -- and there is going to be some line-drawing here that

5

you can't do -- inevitably, there might be someone who gets

6

sued where you're not sure until you actually look at the

7

facts carefully, which is why I think they have the

8

provision to come back here.

that you can't, through the back door, go after them just

it's the Debtor's claim in the first place.

So I can see why one would want to make it clear

in the Debtor release that this covers this type of conduct,

13

and I don't have a problem with a strike-suit mechanism that

14

has people -- if there's any doubt as to which side of the

15

line it would fall on, bringing their suit here first.

16

I just -- I don't -- by definition, then, what we're talking

17

about are not debtor claims, but third-parties claims.

18

just -- I'm not -- I don't see why we are covering them in a

release for non-opioid conduct.

There's no money being paid for that.

Because what is the other stuff?

And it just

10

MS. MONAGHAN:

It's not the basis for the

So, Your Honor, we tried to draft

11

the release in a way that addressed what we see as the

12

fundamental problem with the non-opioid claims, which is

13

that they are often opioid claims in disguise.

14

THE COURT:

Well, all right, but that would be

17

to the Court if you're saying no, it's not in disguise, so

18

you don't have litigation in Florida by the equivalent of

the people in the Madoff case that kept saying, oh, it's not

THE COURT:

MS. MONAGHAN:

That is what we were trying to

Okay, but -If the language doesn't do that, I

think we can try to address.

9

THE COURT:

I don't think -- see if I get this

10

right.

I don't think the way to address those concerns,

11

which are legitimate ones, is to create a category of

12

misfeasance that is excluded from the release.

13

to create a category that's clearly covered by the Debtor

14

release and to make it clear that you can't get around the

15

settlement release, which is over opioid related claims, by

16

creative pleading.

17

I think it's

And ultimately, the Court that imposes the release

18

should be the person that decides whether it's creative

19

pleading or whether it's legitimate, and that is an issue.

20

I mean, that, as I said in the case that I was referring to,

21

the released party one on one point and lost on the other

22

one and, frankly, the only one that had any value was the

23

one they won on, so the party stopped suing.

8

9

the better, you know, metaphor.

10

But it does matter what those gates

But, you know, I do think, and I'd like to address

11

for a moment, Your Honor, what these releases were always

12

intended to pick up and whether it's supposed to be non-

13

opioid -- excuse me -- only opioid liability or whether it

14

was supposed to be broader than that.

15

And, Your Honor, I think we need to put these

16

releases and this plan in the context of the facts and

17

circumstances that brought this plan before the Court.

18

along those facts and circumstances are that we were

19

approached by our counterparties -- so the creditors are

20

large, the Debtors here, the fiduciaries -- to negotiate a

21

release that was expressly supposed to be what we've said

22

global peace, but, you know, is a complete and clean

23

separation from these Debtors for all civil liability.

24
25

And that's in the record, Your Honor.

And

It's in the

record, Ms. Conroy --

THE COURT:

It really isn't.

I mean, David

2

Sackler said it was for opioid liability.

3

said --

4

MR. UZZI:

5

THE COURT:

I know others

Well, he said --- they wanted global peace and they

6

were going to rely on the lawyers.

But look, the way this

7

reads right now, non-opioid actual misconduct, if David

8

Sackler -- it probably hasn't happened, but if he was in a

9

car accident where he was negligent, it would be released

10

because this doesn't cover negligence and that can't be

11

right.

12

MR. UZZI:

Well, I agree with that, Your Honor,

13

but I don't believe it's -- I believe it can't be right, but

14

I also don't believe that's what's picked up here.

15

I don't -- if he's in a car accident, whether he's negligent

16

or not --

17
18

THE COURT:

Well, all right.

I mean,

If he was driving a

company car.

19

MR. UZZI:

I don't -- I don't believe, Your Honor,

20

that is in the release as it relates to -- and it was Mr.

21

Vonnegut said there are capacity limiters on both ends of

22

the release, and there's a capacity limiter also with

23

respect to the party who's granting the release.

24
25

And so, you know, a car accident in a company car
that is the negligence of the individual person is not an

action taken in the capacity as the employee or the director

2

or the shareholder or whatever it may be of the Debtors, and

3

we're not trying to pick that up, Your Honor.

4

What we were trying to do here, Your Honor, what

5

we were trying to do is we're trying to be responsive to the

6

allegation of or maybe a concern that if there were facts

7

that were later discovered that people would have said, hey,

8

you know, that was conduct that should not have been

9

released had we identified it today that it can be picked up

10

here.

11

But if we listen to the testimony, Your Honor, and

12

the questioning in this case -- I mean, you know, in the

13

record, you know, as far as the investigation that --

14

THE COURT:

Well, all right, I'm going to cut you

15

short.

16

is, I think, too narrow.

17

someone is being sued just because they were a board member,

18

all right, or just because they were an officer because it

19

turned out that, you know, Purdue had negligently put

20

together the formula for a non-opioid drug and they were

21

just being sued as an officer or an employee, I think the

22

Debtor release covers it.

23

I just think that would mean then that this language
I understand your point.

If

But I also think there are probably claims that

24

are not deliberate and with actual knowledge that

25

legitimately someone's conduct might actually -- their own

conduct, not just conduct as an officer, but their own

2

individual conduct would make them liable for that product,

3

and we've done nothing about that hypothetical product in

4

this case.

So either this has to be really --

THE COURT:

MR. FOGELMAN:

THE COURT:

9

Your Honor, can I give --

I mean, look, in the case -I'm sorry.

In the case law, the Second Circuit,

including in the Quigley case and in the Manville IV case

10

after the remand from the Supreme Court has really cabined

11

the term derivative -- or actually expanded the term

12

derivative from how it's normally used, which is a claim on

13

behalf of the debtor or through the debtor to be something

14

broader than that.

15

it's not just based on, you know, actual knowledge of

16

misconduct or bad faith or deliberate.

17

and independent conduct.

18

But there's some limits to that, and

It can be separate

So I want to -- I think if you're going to cover

19

non-opioid claims, it really needs to be something more than

20

just Debtor related and really bad stuff.

21

MR. FOGELMAN:

22

THE COURT:

Can I -- sorry.

I mean, non-debtor related or really

23

bad stuff, because you can have debtor-related stuff that I

24

think would fall outside of the Second Circuit's admittedly

25

broad definition of what a derivative claim is, is that

1

entitled to a release under the right circumstances under a

2

plan, and I don't think this language does it.

3

And you can spend a lot of time dealing with that

4

language or you can just carve out non-opioid conduct,

5

except for conduct that is independent of one's acting under

6

one's duty as an officer, director, or, you know, alter ego,

7

veil piercing, et cetera, all of which is clearly

8

derivative.

9

MR. FOGELMAN:

Your Honor, that's all helpful, and

10

I take to heart your comments that you believe that many of

11

those claims, like the failure to supervise claim, would be

a Debtor claim.

13

be, depending upon how somebody would plead it.

14

monitor.

5

that people want to string something along and tie some sort

6

of wrongful conduct to the Sacklers around Adhansia.

7

Yet, yet there seems to be a pretty clear effort

Now, if in fact, one of the Sacklers or one of the

8

released parties, not just the Sacklers, did something with

9

respect to Adhansia that was reckless or deliberate and

10

intended to cause harm, of course, that should be carved

11

out, Your Honor.

12

But these creative legal theories on trying to --

13

and I'm just picking Adhansia of one example of trying to

14

bring the Sacklers back in and seems to be intended to get

15

through a back door is what we're trying to solve for.

16
17

I'm not particularly wedded to how we solve for
that, Your Honor, but it is something that either --

18

THE COURT:

Again, to me, if people are suing

19

them, I guess it's perfectly legitimate to not to want to

20

have your clients even be sued for just being on the board,

21

which includes getting information, or for being an officer.

22

But at the same time, you're putting the onus on

23

the party suing to show not only that that isn't the case,

24

but also that they acted deliberately, recklessly, or in

25

some other standard that's not really tied, I think,

language, to do that.

examples that you're not going to be able to cover unless

gravamen of every potential truly separate claim and instead

24

say that this release will cover, because it's a Debtor

212-267-6868

Page 255

would have and those are expansive, including derivative

2

claims for acting improperly on the board, for example.

3

But if there's a separate claim that doesn't fit

4

into that and it comes back to the Court and the Court finds

5

that, this release shouldn't cover it.

6

MR. FOGELMAN:

THE COURT:

That's helpful.

I think that the released parties

MR. FOGELMAN:

And I think what I'm

I appreciate Your Honor's

considering our argument, and I have nothing further at this

time.

Thank you.

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

I mean, look, this

19

is all over the case law.

20

McMahon says, you know, you address what you were settling

21

and not everything else, and they rewrote the plan in

THE COURT:

Afternoon.

3

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I just

4

wanted to take up the opportunity Your Honor had offered.

5

We do have a few comments on the recent changes, in addition

6

to what we had filed in our objection and our oral

7

arguments.

8

And I wanted to bring the Court's attention of the

9

new definition of shareholder releases, which is now Exhibit

10

X to the shareholder agreement, as well as the defined term,

11

"designated shareholder release parties," which is Exhibit S

12

to the shareholder agreement.

13

Your Honor, can you hear me?

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

16

Yes.

And I wanted to point out --

I can hear you fine.
Okay.

All right, thank you,

Your Honor.

17

I wanted to point out first the shareholder

18

agreement as testimony shared, it has not actually been

19

finalized yet, so the released parties are Exhibit X and

20

Exhibit S could be expanded and we don't know who those are.

21

And, in fact, Your Honor, pursuant to the shareholder

22

agreement of Section 1106, even after it's signed, it could

23

still be amended, and I think between agreement of the NBT

24

and the Sacklers.

25

So we're concerned that even after --

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

I'm assuming it will be attached to

the confirmation order and the parties will have a chance to

2

review it before the order is entered.

3
4

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

But, Your Honor, even after the

order is entered, the shareholder agreement does allow --

5

THE COURT:

6

because that's the injunction.

7

MAN 1:

THE COURT:

10

MAN 1:

No.

Mr. Fogelman doesn't need to worry about

that.

12
13

Your Honor, we're not going to be adding

parties.

9

11

No, no, not after the order is entered

THE COURT:
wanted to.

14

They wouldn't be able to even if they

They're not going to do that.
MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Could they make the case,

15

Section 11.06 to make it clear that the amendments that they

16

can make only are up to confirmation?

17
18

THE COURT:
order.

The Court's approving this and nothing further.

19
20

Well, put it in the confirmation

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Thank you, Your Honor.

That

would be very helpful.

21

THE COURT:

Okay.

22

MAN 1:

23

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

That works for us, Your Honor.
And as I said also, Your Honor,

24

Exhibit X still -- we were talking about the breadth of the

25

releases.

212-267-6868

Exhibit X still includes as related entities the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 259
1

businesses, the assets, and the entities owned by Side A.

2

We believe this is overly broad and, in fact, I believe it

3

was Mr. Mortimer Sackler had indicated he couldn't even

4

identify all of his investments, so we think that term is

5

too broad.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

8

this point.

9

Why?
Unidentified, Your Honor, at

We can't identify.

THE COURT:

But if you cabin the -- there's no --

10

these are the payors, right?

11

what's going to be released as far as third parties is

12

opioid-related claims.

13

these entities, separately and apart in conjunction with

14

Purdue, was engaging in any opioid-related activity.

15
16

So there's no indication that any of

On the other hand, they are backing up the payment
of the plan.

17
18

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

THE COURT:

20

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

But -- all right.

Keep going.

I'll move on to my next point,

Your Honor.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

24

THE COURT:

25

Our concern, Your Honor, is

these are entities that even the Sacklers may not know.

19

21

And as we've just discussed,

Okay.
In regard to the --

I guess you haven't read the discovery

that the committee and the Debtors had, right?

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

THE COURT:

They have.

3

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Okay.

Your Honor, in regard to the

4

non-opioid misconduct claims, we -- I think you had

5

addressed that, and we just reserve our rights on that to

6

see what the new drafting is regarding this because we had

7

concerns regarding that.

8
9

And then last point, Your Honor, I had is just a
concern regarding, once again, the breadth of the releases.

10

We do note that the Debtors -- we're trying to figure out if

11

the Debtors are including released parties that are not --

12

releasing parties that are not -- or causing releases that

13

will be suffered by parties that are not creditors of this

14

case.

15

The releasing parties include holders of claims

16

and causes of action.

17

defines creditors in this case as just part of the holders

18

of claims.

19

causes of actions, it makes it look like they're trying to

20

expand those who are going to give releases to those who are

21

not creditors in the case.

22

just people who are creditors in the case, they should make

23

it clear in the documents, Your Honor.

24
25

And I know the bankruptcy code

So when they throw in holders of claims and

And if they need to limit it to

And I believe those are the only additional
comments I had, unless Your Honor has any questions.

MR. UZZI:

3

Okay.
Nothing further from the Debtor, Your

Honor.

MR. GOLDMAN:

THE COURT:

MR. GOLDMAN:

7

Sure.
Irve Goldman, Pullman Comley, for

the State of Connecticut.

9

Your Honor, may I be heard briefly?

I had agreed to very briefly address this argument
under the miscellaneous topic, as opposed to separately.

10

don't expect to take more than five minutes on this, Your

11

Honor, so I hope you'll bear with me.

12

I

So I'm presenting this in addition to the states

13

that joined our objection either expressly or by

14

incorporation, and also on behalf of Rhode Island and

15

Delaware.

16

plan infringes on the states' rights to have had their

17

police power claims adjudicated with damages fixed in the

18

actions they commenced against Purdue in their own courts.

19

It relates to the argument in our brief that the

And this relates to Section 362(b)(4), the

20

legislative history of which provides that the purpose of it

21

is to allow a government action for a violation of a

22

consumer protection law to proceed unabated by the automatic

23

stay in order to "fix damages for violations of such a law."

24

The plan takes away that right by channeling all

25

the states' claims to the NOAT Trust, which will be funded

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 262
1

by the Sackler plan contributions, and then distributing

2

those funds based on a state-by-state allocation percentage.

3

And in fact, it's a pot plan from which the states will take

4

their allocated share of what is put in the pot.

5

This mechanism, we contend, eliminates the states'

6

rights to fix damages in their own actions, and therefore,

7

the plan doesn't comply with the applicable provisions in

8

Title 11.

9

I realize it would have been administratively

10

cumbersome and time-consuming to have allowed for the fixing

11

of damages in those actions in this case, but that is simply

12

the hand the Debtors were dealt when they invoked the

13

protections of the bankruptcy court, and I would submit they

14

must therefore live with the burdens of the Code.

15

is set forth in 362(b)(4).

16

And that

I would also submit that administrative

17

convenience can't be allowed to trump the clear protection

18

provided for states to fix their claims for damages without

19

being held up by the automatic stay.

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. GOLDMAN:

22

THE COURT:

Well -And that's all I have, Your Honor.
-- that's already been litigated and

23

affirmed on appeal, without any further appeal.

24

quite sure what you're saying at this point.

25

suggesting that even though 362 by itself wouldn't apply

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I'm not

Are you

516-608-2400

Page 263
1

post-confirmation, that somehow they would have a right to

2

liquidate their claims, even though they would get whatever

3

recovery they'd get under the plan?

4

MR. GOLDMAN:

5

THE COURT:

6

So they would --

No, I'm not saying --- the states would actually spend the

money to do that?

7

MR. GOLDMAN:

No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor.

8

I'm saying that that was a preliminary injunction.

9

wasn't a permanent injunction --

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

It

Right.
-- to stay the states.

And the fact

12

that we're at the confirmation stage should not cut off the

13

rights to have liquidated those claims --

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. GOLDMAN:

16

THE COURT:

That's the --- because of --- whole reason that the...

Look,

17

Congress, in the legislative history made it clear that one

18

could still enjoin police power under the right

19

circumstances to liquidate a claim.

20

provision itself says it doesn't apply to payment of the

21

claim.

22

And of course, the

The plan is just providing for payment of the claim.
So I just -- I hear your argument, but frankly, it

23

makes no sense.

24

it's just...

25

It's another sand in the gears.

MR. GOLDMAN:

212-267-6868

I hear Your Honor.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I mean,

I'm just trying

516-608-2400

Page 264
1

to make the point that I understand the injunction was

2

issued and it was preliminary.

3

means we shouldn't have had the right to -- before the plan

4

reached the confirmation stage -- to liquidate those claims,

5

instead of having them just put into a trust based on an

6

allocation formula.

7

THE COURT:

I don't think that that

In fact, the injunction applies

8

through confirmation, and then the stay is no longer in

9

place, and therefore, 362 doesn't apply at all.

10

Instead,

it's the plan.

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

I would maintain that because of

12

that, our rights are subverted under 362(b)(4).

13

just leave it at that, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

MR. KAMINETZKY:

17

And I'll

Your Honor, if I could briefly

Benjamin Kaminetzky, of Davis Polk, for the

18

THE COURT:

Okay, fine.

19

MR. KAMINETZKY:

I know -- I'm actually so happy

20

that this was raised, because we've all been wondering what

21

plan B was for the objecting states, and I think this is

22

just a perfect way to end today.

23

saying is that we should go back to the first day of this

24

case, when the Debtors basically said, we're done, we're not

25

litigating anymore.

212-267-6868

Because what they're

In Your Honor's words, we've given

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 265
1

ourselves up.

2

But they're still demanding -- and then we've

3

worked for months and months, years, on a distribution

4

mechanism, but now they're saying, you know what, we want to

5

have a trial anyway on the merits against the Debtors, who

6

aren't contesting liability, just for like fun, so that we

7

could then...

8

I don't know -- are they saying then they'll go

9

back to the NOAT anyway after they have their show trial,

10

that we're not contesting liability, and they'll abide by

11

the NOAT?

12

line, and the State of Connecticut will ignore the last two

13

years, and we'll get our judgment against the Debtors, who

14

aren't contesting liability, and we'll get everything?

15

is just so confounding.

16

Or are they saying, no, we won't; we'll jump the

It

And I'm actually -- this is a great way to end the

17

hearing because what we've just showed is that there's

absolutely no alternative other than going back to September

He's saying he wants to

They want to have 50 trials.

Maybe it's even

Maybe because -- I'm not sure if this goes to all the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 266
1

instrumentalities of the stay too, so we should have

2

thousands of trials around the country against a Debtor that

3

admitted on the first day that it's no longer contesting

4

liability.

5

It is just the insanity -- or, I shouldn't say

6

that -- the idea that this is what's being advocated at this

7

point, right here, at the last minute of the confirmation

8

hearing, I think speaks volumes.

9

THE COURT:

10

this diplomatically.

11

where the high quality of the lawyers has actually not been

12

a good thing, because lawyers who are really creative and

13

thoughtful sometimes come up with ideas that maybe seem well

14

in the shower, but actually don't make any sense.

15

just...

16

Well, look, I think...

I want to say

There have been times in this case

And I

Look, Mr. Goldman, your clients have made some

17

good points going to the merits of the Sackler settlement.

18

That's where the focus should be, not on something like

19

this.

20

parties would continue to discuss the former, and not burden

21

this case with the latter.

This is just not constructive.

22

MR. GOLDMAN:

23

THE COURT:

So, I would hope the

I hear you, Your Honor.
Okay.

All right.

Mr. Underwood, I

don't know if you had a comment on the release language, or

4

provision in the plan that regards excluded claims.

5

is a portion of that provision that addresses Canadian

6

claims, or Canadian claims against Purdue Canada.

7

We have a provision in

It's very straightforward as well.

We have a
There

We now have language in that provision that says

8

that non-opioid actual misconduct claims are effectively, I

9

guess, released.

10
11

And this is --

THE COURT:

No, that's what we've just been

talking about, so I wouldn't worry about that.

12

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Okay.

And the second aspect of

13

that, very quickly, Your Honor.

14

I did ask the Debtors' counsel about this last evening, or

15

this morning -- provision 11.1(e) would then suggest that if

16

there's any provision such as the non-opioid actual

17

misconduct claim in the excluded claim, we would have to

18

come back to the United States to get approval.

19

little untoward that the Provinces at this point would have

20

to come to Your Honor in order to bring, you know, a federal

21

conveyance action against a Canadian entity.

22
23

It seems a

I just want to put that on the record, make sure
the Debtor understood where I was coming from.

24
25

My understanding is -- and

THE COURT:

No.

Look, first of all, claims

against the Canadian entity would have to be for fraudulent

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 268
1

-- I don't think there's any release of a fraudulent

2

transfer claim against the Canadian entity in this plan.

3

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Okay.

I'm not -- perhaps it's not

4

a release.

5

want to delay this further, but -- a claim that is not based

6

upon conduct of the Debtors, including opioid-related

7

activities of the Debtors, and that effectively -- or any

8

non-opioid actual misconduct claim.

9

But what this seems to say is -- and I don't

So I would presume that any Canadian creditor

could argue in Canada that the officers, directors,

11

Sacklers, owners, whomever, have left the Canadian entity

type of claim that may be a non-opioid claim that could not

MR. VONNEGUT:

So, the gatekeeping function that

Mr. Underwood is referring to in 11.1(e).

3

to non-opioid actual misconduct claims, which are their own

4

prong under excluded claims.

5

Canadian entity that are not tied to the Debtor, those are

6

separately excluded claims, and there's no gatekeeping

7

function if he's pursuing those claims.

8

THE COURT:

That only applies

The claims against the

No, but his point was a different one,

9

which is if the Debtor or a released party was being sued

10

for having received a fraudulent transfer by the Canadian

11

company, whether they would have to -- the Plaintiff would

12

have to come to this Court as a gatekeeping mechanism to

13

proceed.

14

And this should be able to be drafted so that the

15

gatekeeping mechanism doesn't apply to clearly independent

16

claims such as that, where if board member X received

$100,000 as a gift from Purdue Canada, he wasn't a board

Page 270

Purdue Canada is suing the board member because she was a

2

board member of Purdue when Purdue got a fraudulent

4

the only basis for the lawsuit is -- or the basis for the

5

lawsuit, or a basis for the lawsuit, is that she was just a

7

discharge, the Debtors' discharge, because you're just

trying to do a backdoor to get at the Debtor through the

MR. TROOP:

Huebner.

So let me

Well, thank you very much, Mr.

Your Honor, Andrew Troop, for the Nonconsenting

States.

11

Your Honor, I actually don't want to divert at all

12

from the (indiscernible) truly heartfelt comments by the

13

Court and Mr. Huebner with respect to the individuals in

14

this case.

15

represent individual victims (indiscernible) that we all

16

share, and our admiration for the two victims who spoke

17

(indiscernible).

18

I think it's something that all of us who don't

But do we have some process things that we have to

19

get to, and Mr. Huebner touched on them.

20

to make sure that we, at the appropriate time and in the

21

appropriate way, do not lose sight of the issues that remain

22

unresolved and may be subject to debate with regard to how,

23

for example, the Sackler settlement is resolved.

24
25

And we just need

Your Honor, this afternoon during the hearing,

injunction for NewCo, where there is an issue that is

2

identified (indiscernible) open, and we just need to manage

3

that process and want to do so in a way that's efficient for

4

the Court.

Debtors.

And so we will continue to work on that with the

But this is a complex case with lots of threads

7

still untied, and we just need to make sure that we don’t

8

lose sight of that.

THE COURT:

Okay.

Fair point.

I've told the

10

parties that I intend to rule Friday morning at 10:00.

11

intend to give you a bench ruling.

12

it's important in cases large and small to move the matter

13

promptly, after having heard the evidence.

14

calendar, that's the best way to do it.

15

a lengthy bench ruling, I'll go over the transcript, and I

16

may edit it, although I won't change it in terms of the

17

substance.

18

get that ruling and know that they're going to get it on

19

Friday morning.

20

I

As you know, I believe

And given my

As I often do with

But I think it's important for the parties to

However, if the parties, as I have encouraged them

21

to do, will reach some form of agreement, either among

22

themselves or with the efforts of Judge Chapman as mediator,

23

they can let me know before I give that ruling, if they want

24

to circulate it, socialize it, make sure everyone

25

understands it.

212-267-6868

I won't be offended at all by that.

fact, I'll encourage you, as I have encouraged you, to

2

continue that work.

3

As far as other loose ends are concerned, if they

4

are truly loose ends, I guess I will have to deal with them

5

after I give you my ruling, which the parties have to

6

realize will in some measure give me a fair amount of

7

control over the outcome, if they can't reach an agreement

8

themselves, because the issue, almost by definition, will

9

not be so important that it would hold up confirmation.

10

Rather, it's just an issue that needs to get resolved one

11

way or the other, and of course, I would rather the parties

12

resolve it on their own, as I expect they would do.

13

they can't, I guess we'll deal with that after my ruling and

14

as part of the process of submitting the confirmation order.

15

But if

I won't require the order to be formally settled

16

if I grant confirmation.

17

parties have sufficient time to read any changes to it,

18

including -- you know, obviously, as I told Mr. Anker, he

19

would have time, everyone else falls in that boat too.

But I will want to make sure the

So, I want to thank all the parties.

We covered

21

an extraordinary amount of ground in six days of trial and

22

two days of oral argument.

23

without the parties working very hard to streamline the

24

trail efficiently, which I believe by and large they did.

25

We could not have done that

And I also want to thank all of the lawyers, some

parties know my views on that particular issue, which

4

unfortunately, when you're on Zoom, I found the Court needs

5

to be more expressive about than if you're there in person.

I'm not quite sure what human chemistry leads to that
