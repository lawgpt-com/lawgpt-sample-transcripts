Joey Tribbiani: Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Rachel Green: I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Joey Tribbiani: Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Rachel Green: Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
