Rachel Green: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
Joey Tribbiani: All right.
Rachel Green: Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?

Rachel Green: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?

Rachel Green: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yes.
Rachel Green: Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Joey Tribbiani: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
