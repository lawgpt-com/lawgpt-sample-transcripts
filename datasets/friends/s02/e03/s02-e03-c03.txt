Mr. Treeger: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Monica Geller: What can we do for you?
Buddy Boyles: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
Monica Geller: Well, what about his family?
Buddy Boyles: He didn't have any.
Rachel Green: Ok, so let's talk money.
Buddy Boyles: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
