Rachel Green: Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Mrs. Lynch: Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Rachel Green: Heard what?
Mrs. Lynch: Joanna passed away last night.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! How?!
Mrs. Lynch: Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Mrs. Lynch: I know!
Rachel Green: Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Mrs. Lynch: I didn't realize that she was so close.
Rachel Green: Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Mrs. Lynch: No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Rachel Green: Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Mrs. Lynch: No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Sophie: Good morning!
Rachel Green: Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Sophie: I sure did!
