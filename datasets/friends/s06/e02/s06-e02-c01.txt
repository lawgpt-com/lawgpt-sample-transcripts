Ross Geller: Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Rachel Green: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross Geller: Oh yeah, why not?
Rachel Green: Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Ross Geller: Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Phoebe Buffay: Always.
Ross Geller: I didn't get the annulment.

Ross Geller: Hey, do you have any gum?
Rachel Green: Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Phoebe Buffay: Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Rachel Green: Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.

Phoebe Buffay: Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Rachel Green: Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
Ross Geller: I know.
Phoebe Buffay: Ross?!
Ross Geller: Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Phoebe Buffay: Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Ross Geller: Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
Phoebe Buffay: So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Ross Geller: Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Phoebe Buffay: Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!

Rachel Green: Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey Rach!
Rachel Green: What was that?!
Phoebe Buffay: Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Rachel Green: I haven't seen it yet!
Phoebe Buffay: Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Rachel Green: Noooooooo!!
