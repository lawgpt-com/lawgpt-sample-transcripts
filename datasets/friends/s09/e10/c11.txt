Chandler Bing: I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica Geller: Well, not anymore.
Chandler Bing: But we don't do that.
Monica Geller: I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler Bing: How drunk are you?
Monica Geller: Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler Bing: That's the perfect amount!
Monica Geller: Okay!
Monica Geller: Y'know what's weird?
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: This doesn't feel weird!
Chandler Bing: I know.
Monica Geller: You're a really good kisser.
Chandler Bing: Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Monica Geller: Hm-hmm!
Chandler Bing: Okay!
Monica Geller: Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler Bing: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica Geller: We're gonna see each other naked.
Chandler Bing: Yep!
Monica Geller: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler Bing: Count of three?
Monica Geller: One!
Chandler Bing: Two!
Monica Geller: Two!
Chandler Bing: Three!
Chandler Bing: Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica Geller: Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Chandler Bing: Eh!
