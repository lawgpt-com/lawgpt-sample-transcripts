Joey Tribbiani: All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, all right.
Ross Geller: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: So, we're having fun, right?
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Ross Geller: I'm kinda beat.
Chandler Bing: Actually, me too.
Joey Tribbiani: Are you serious?!
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Gunther: So you guys want coffees?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Ross Geller: Yeah, me too.
Chandler Bing: Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Joey Tribbiani: I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Ross Geller: I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.

Ross Geller: How sad are we?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I know.
Chandler Bing: Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Chandler Bing: Yeah!
Ross Geller: And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Joey Tribbiani: We're 29, we're not women.
