Rachel Green: You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Joey Tribbiani: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Rachel Green: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Joey Tribbiani: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Monica Geller: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Rachel Green: Of course, I'd be honored!
Chandler Bing: Thanks!
Monica Geller: Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Chandler Bing: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Monica Geller: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Joey Tribbiani: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Monica Geller: Clearly we were wrong.
Joey Tribbiani: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Monica Geller: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
Chandler Bing: So excited about your letter!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
#ALL#: Hey Phoebe!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Monica Geller: Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel Green: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
Phoebe Buffay: YEAH!
Chandler Bing: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Joey Tribbiani: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Monica Geller: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
Chandler Bing: That's where people make number two!!
