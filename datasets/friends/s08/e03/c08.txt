Mr. Treeger: I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
Joey Tribbiani: Huh. So then I can heat this up?
Mr. Treeger: Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Mr. Treeger: Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no.

Phoebe Buffay: Holy mother of God!!!
Ross Geller: With my child.
Phoebe Buffay: That is brand new information!!
Ross Geller: You already know don't you?
Phoebe Buffay: A little bit.
Joey Tribbiani: How are you doing?
Ross Geller: Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, what did you say to her?
Ross Geller: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh Ross.
Ross Geller: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Ross Geller: I gotta go find her.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Ross Geller: Evidently they do.
Joey Tribbiani: What?!
