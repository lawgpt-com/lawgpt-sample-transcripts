Joey Tribbiani: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Phoebe Buffay: I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.

Joey Tribbiani: Feel better now?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.

Phoebe Buffay: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Phoebe Buffay: Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Joey Tribbiani: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
