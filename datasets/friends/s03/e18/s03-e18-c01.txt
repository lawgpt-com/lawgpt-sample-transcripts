Monica Geller: What's so funny?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.

Gunther: Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Chandler Bing: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Gunther: Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Chandler Bing: Okay.

Gunther: Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Chandler Bing: No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Rachel Green: Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Chandler Bing: Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Rachel Green: Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Ross Geller: Pffhah.
Rachel Green: What's your problem?
Ross Geller: Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Rachel Green: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Ross Geller: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Rachel Green: Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Chandler Bing: Or what my Father called Thursday night.
