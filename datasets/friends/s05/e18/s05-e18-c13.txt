Ross Geller: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Ross Geller: Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah right!
Ross Geller: No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Ross Geller: Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Joey Tribbiani: What you do mean?
Ross Geller: I think, sub-consciously...
Joey Tribbiani: Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Ross Geller: I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Ross Geller: No!
Joey Tribbiani: No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Ross Geller: There you go. Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Ross Geller: No.
Joey Tribbiani: Eh, what are you gonna do?
