Rachel Green: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Chandler Bing: You didn't like that?
Rachel Green: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Monica Geller: Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Rachel Green: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Monica Geller: Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Rachel Green: Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Rachel Green: No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .

Chandler Bing: You don't know!
