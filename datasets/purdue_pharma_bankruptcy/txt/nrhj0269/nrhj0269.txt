PROCEEDINGS
THE COURT: Okay, good morning. This is Judge

3 Drain. We're here in In re. Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al.
4

The matters on today's calendar are being held

5 completely remotely primarily by Zoom for Government unless
6 someone doesn't have access to a screen, in which case, they
7 are participating by telephone.
8

I have the agenda for today's hearing, and I'm

9 happy to go down in the order of the agenda, which has been
10 submitted by the Debtors' counsel.
11

MR. VONNEGUT: Thank you, Your Honor. Good

12 morning. For the record, I'm Eli Vonnegut of Davis Polk &
13 Wardwell on behalf of the Debtors. Can you hear me, Your
14 Honor?
15

THE COURT: Yes. I hear you fine.

16

MR. VONNEGUT: Thank you very much. The first

17 item on the agenda today is the Debtors' motion for
18 authority to pay or reimburse the fees and expenses of the
19 Non-Consent State Group, the Ad Hoc Committee, and the MSGE
20 Group. This motion was filed on October 19, Docket Entry
21 3986.
22

Your Honor, the motion is unopposed, so I would

23 propose to just very briefly just describe the basics and
24 then happy to address any questions that Your Honor may
25 have.

Page 11

Page 13
1

THE COURT: Okay.

2

MR. VONNEGUT: Okay. So, Your Honor, this motion

3 is carrying out effectively the agreement that we reported
4 to Your Honor on August 13 that was agreed in conjunction
5 with confirmation of the plan to cover the fees of the Non6 Consenting State Group that were incurred through the end of
7 the mediation leading to the final form of the plan.
8

Some of those fees were shared across the Non-

9 Consenting State Group and the Ad Hoc Committee. And
10 lastly, in conjunction with discussions around this motion,
11 we also collectively agreed to pay certain fees incurred by
12 the Multi-State Governmental Entities Group as part of the
13 bankruptcy proceeding as well.
14

All told, the fees that are subject to this motion

15 include approximately $7.5 million incurred by Pillsbury
16 Winthrop, just shy of $70,000 by NERA Economic Consulting,
17 $4 million for the Brattle Group, and just over $50,000 for
18 Dr. Fred Hyde and those fees were all either purely Non19 Consenting States Group or shared between the Non-Consenting
20 States and the Ad Hoc Committee of Supporting Creditors.
21 And lastly, for the MSGE, we have $58,900 for Seitz, Van
22 Ogtrop & Green, and $648,000 for Godrey & Kahn.
23

Your Honor, briefly, all of these fees were

24 incurred in furtherance of the largely consensual resolution
25 brought to the Court. We maintain that payment of these

4 (Pages 10 - 13)

6 so, unless Your Honor has any questions for me or any of the

7 other professionals that are the subject of this motion, we

8 would respectfully ask that the Court grant the motion and

8

9 authorize payment of these fees.
10

THE COURT: Okay. All right. I mean, the reason

9 I'm asking this is the authority cited for this motion is

THE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I

10 Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and I agree with the

11 understand the context for this motion. The plan itself

11 motion that there is authority under Section 363(b) in the

12 didn't provide for these fees to be allowed and paid, right?

12 right circumstances to approve payment of fees.

13

MR. VONNEGUT: That's correct, Your Honor.

13

14

THE COURT: Okay. And as far as the plan is

14 former District Judge Mukasey in U.S. Trustee v. Bethlehem

And I guess the best discussion of that is by

15 concerned, and this is highlighted in the Unsecured

15 Steel Corp., 2003 U.S. District Lexis 12909 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).

16 Creditors' Committee's statement in support of this motion,

16 It's also recognized by another district judge in In re.

17 the payments are coming out of the distributions that would

17 Enron Corp, 335 B.R. 22 at Page 29 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).

18 otherwise go to the governmental entities, correct?

18

19

19 generally where payment of fees is allowed under 363(b)

MR. VONNEGUT: That's correct, Your Honor. The

The issue I have here is that in those cases and

20 governmental entities under the plan are the residual

20 instead of under a different section of the code, the

21 claimants. And so, effectively, anything paid out of

21 payments are agreed early in the case to facilitate a

22 general estate funds ultimately comes out of their plan

22 critical creditor's ability to interact with the debtor

23 distributions.

23 and/or other parties in interest in a well-represented way.

24

24

THE COURT: So it's not reducing amounts that

25 would be paid to personal injury creditors under the plan.

For example, in Bethlehem Steel, it was payment of

25 the union's fees. The union was the main creditor, and its

1

MR. VONNEGUT: No, it will not impact recoveries

Page 17
1 involvement in the case was critical to any restructuring of

2 of non-governmental creditors.

2 Bethlehem Steel. And it was on that basis that I recognize

3

3 the payment of the Ad Hoc Committee Group in this case.

THE COURT: And I don't believe that this

4 agreement was part of the mediated settlement with the non-

4

5 consenting -- with the 15 non-consenting states, correct?

5 comes at the end of the case, and I was asking the questions

6

MR. VONNEGUT: It was agreed to --

6 I was asking to see whether and in what context it was

THE COURT: The settlement negotiated with the

7 agreed to.

8 help of Judge Chapman as a mediator.
9

8

MR. VONNEGUT: Correct, Your Honor. It was not a

This is a little different in that the agreement

It would seem to me that if it comes at the end of

9 the case, normally, one would focus on the standard in

10 formal component of that agreement. It was agreed to in

10 Section 503(b)(3)(D) of 503(b)(4). And to some extent and,

11 that context effectively.

11 in fact, to a very large extent, the motion also sets forth

12

THE COURT: What does that mean?

12 facts to satisfy that standard, i.e. the work done by the

13

MR. VONNEGUT: It was agreed to in connection with

13 Non-Consenting States Group and the professionals that it

14 the support of the Non-Consenting States Group or the plan,

14 would be covered by this application, covered tasks that it

15 but it was after the conclusion of the mediation.

15 would appear to me did make a substantial contribution to

16

16 the case, which is the standard under 503(b)(3) and (4).

THE COURT: So they had already agreed to support

17 the plan, and this was agreed afterwards? I see Mr. Troop

17

18 there. He may be better able to answer that question than

18 group of creditors in terms of coming up with a coordinated

MR. TROOP: Good morning, Your Honor. Andrew

It had always been part of the discussions from

The due diligence also covered not just the

25 settlement was that it was not, as you know, unanimous on

10

THE COURT: All right. So there have been no

And so, I think in that broad sense, one could

10 view that pleading as an objection to the motion, but it

15 difficulty with the clerk's office getting these objections

16

16 in and getting information processed properly, getting links

And there is, you know, to a certain degree, I

MS. ISAACS: Your Honor, that is correct, and I

17 think it's correct to say that, as Mr. Troop said, there was

17 and everything else to these proceedings.

18 always an expectation that this would be a component of the

18

19 agreement. But you are correct, of course, that there was

19 objected to this motion?

20 not an agreement very early in the case to pay these fees.

20

21 And so, frankly, we do think either analytical framework

THE COURT: Well, I mean, one of the reasons I

MS. ISAACS: I don't want you to take things

15 element of that agreement; something to buy off, in other

16 October 19, 2021. Did you object to this motion with regard

17

17 to this relief?

The amount, frankly, isn't -- although it's, in

THE COURT: I'm trying to figure out what you have

18 terms of dollars, significant amount, it's not the type of

25 basis for your objection to this motion?

Page 24

MS. ISAACS: The basis to my objection to the

THE COURT: Right.

2 motion is that it's out of order. We cannot continue to

MR. TROOP: That the payment of the funds under
