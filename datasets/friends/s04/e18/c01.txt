Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Phoebe Buffay: Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Chandler Bing: All right.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Joey Tribbiani: Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Phoebe Buffay: I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Alice Knight: Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! What are you doing here?
Alice Knight: Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Alice Knight: No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Chandler Bing: Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Alice Knight: Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Alice Knight: You think about it.
