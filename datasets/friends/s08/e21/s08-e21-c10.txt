The Cooking Teacher: Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?

The Cooking Teacher: And the cream?
Joey Tribbiani: Cheese makes me thirsty.
The Cooking Teacher: Okay. Let's move on.
Joey Tribbiani: All right.
The Cooking Teacher: Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station! Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
Monica Geller: Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
The Cooking Teacher: Well, hats off to the chef.
Monica Geller: I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
The Cooking Teacher: The chef!
Monica Geller: That's right.
