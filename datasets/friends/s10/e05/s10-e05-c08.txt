Joey Tribbiani: You slept out here?
Rachel Green: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'
Joey Tribbiani: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
Rachel Green: Joey, I can't do that!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Rachel Green: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
Joey Tribbiani: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
Rachel Green: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, Monica made us!
Rachel Green: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
Amy Green: Good morning.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeaah.
Rachel Green: Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
Amy Green: Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
Rachel Green: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Amy Green: Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
Joey Tribbiani: I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
