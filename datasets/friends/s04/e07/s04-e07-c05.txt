Chandler Bing: No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Kathy: Horrible!
Chandler Bing: Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Kathy: No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Chandler Bing: Okay!
Kathy: No, but that's bad!
Chandler Bing: Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Kathy: What?!
Chandler Bing: Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Kathy: Can you really do that?
Chandler Bing: I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Kathy: Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Chandler Bing: Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Kathy: I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Chandler Bing: I-I think we have too.
Kathy: Okay. Bye.
Chandler Bing: Bye. Are you still out there?
Kathy: No.
