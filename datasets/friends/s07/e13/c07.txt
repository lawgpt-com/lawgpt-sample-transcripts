Ross Geller: Dad?
Jack Geller: I'm here!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Jack Geller: Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Ross Geller: Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Jack Geller: Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Ross Geller: Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Jack Geller: I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Monica Geller: Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Jack Geller: Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Monica Geller: I used to love to play restaurant.
Ross Geller: Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Monica Geller: Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Jack Geller: So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Ross Geller: Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
Jack Geller: I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Ross Geller: Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Jack Geller: Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
Ross Geller: It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Jack Geller: Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Ross Geller: What?
Jack Geller: Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Ross Geller: How are you ever going to sell this place?
Jack Geller: I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Ross Geller: Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Jack Geller: You don't secretly smoke do you?
Ross Geller: No!
Jack Geller: So it's just your mother then.
