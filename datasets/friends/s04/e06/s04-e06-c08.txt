Chandler Bing: Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Rachel Green: Any luck?
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Rachel Green: All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Chandler Bing: She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Rachel Green: Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Chandler Bing: Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Rachel Green: Oh! Pathetic!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Chandler Bing: Where?
Joey Tribbiani: Our place, the hall! I...
Chandler Bing: I got something for her. It's a book!
Joey Tribbiani: A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Chandler Bing: No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
Joey Tribbiani: You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Chandler Bing: No, it came out to an even twenty.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
