Monica Geller: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Chandler Bing: We said seven!
Monica Geller: We said six!
Chandler Bing: The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Monica Geller: Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Chandler Bing: Oh my good God.
Monica Geller: Ugh!
Phoebe Buffay: I know what time you said.
Chandler Bing: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Monica Geller: What time?
Phoebe Buffay: Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Chandler Bing: What does it say?!
Phoebe Buffay: I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Chandler Bing: Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Phoebe Buffay: Thanks! So are you.
Chandler Bing: I told you I should not wear this color.
Phoebe Buffay: Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Chandler Bing: So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Phoebe Buffay: That's right.
Monica Geller: Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Phoebe Buffay: Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
