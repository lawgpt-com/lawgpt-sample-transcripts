Rachel Green: Ohh, hi, Kim.
Kim: Hi Rachel.
Rachel Green: Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Kim: You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Rachel Green: Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Kim: That's not true?
Rachel Green: No.
Kim: Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Rachel Green: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Kim: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Rachel Green: I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Kim: Hi Ralph.
Ralph Lauren: Hi Kim.
Kim: Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
