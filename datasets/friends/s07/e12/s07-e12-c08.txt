Joey Tribbiani: All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ross Geller: Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Ross Geller: Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Joey Tribbiani: What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Ross Geller: Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Ross Geller: Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
Joey Tribbiani: No.
Ross Geller: Okay. Well, you be careful.
Joey Tribbiani: What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Ross Geller: Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Joey Tribbiani: Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
