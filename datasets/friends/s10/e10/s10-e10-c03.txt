Chandler Bing: Hi!
Monica Geller: Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Chandler Bing: I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica Geller: Nancy doesn't smoke!
Chandler Bing: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Monica Geller: So? What do you think of the house?
Chandler Bing: It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Monica Geller: Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Chandler Bing: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Monica Geller: Don't you love the huge yard?
Chandler Bing: And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica Geller: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Chandler Bing: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica Geller: So? Do you think we should get it?
Chandler Bing: I don't know. What do you think?
Monica Geller: I think we should.
Chandler Bing: I do too.
Monica Geller: This is huge!
Chandler Bing: I know.
Monica Geller: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Chandler Bing: I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
Monica Geller: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Chandler Bing: We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Monica Geller: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler Bing: I know. Gooooood luck with it.
