Rachel Green: I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
Monica Geller: Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Rachel Green: God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
Monica Geller: Does he?
Rachel Green: What?
Monica Geller: Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Rachel Green: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
Molly: She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
Rachel Green: Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Monica Geller: Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Rachel Green: Yeah, sure!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.
Monica Geller: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Rachel Green: Oh, give me!
Phoebe Buffay: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Mike Hannigan: Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Rachel Green: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Monica Geller: So this is what a stroke feels like.
Phoebe Buffay: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
Rachel Green: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Phoebe Buffay: No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Rachel Green: whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Phoebe Buffay: Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
Ross Geller: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Ross Geller: We have to stop them before something happens!
Chandler Bing: Right behind you, big guy!
