Phoebe Buffay: So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Duncan: Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh. . .K. How come?
Duncan: Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Duncan: Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Phoebe Buffay: Huuh.
Duncan: Yeah, I know, I.
Phoebe Buffay: I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Duncan: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
Phoebe Buffay: So how long have you known?
Duncan: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Phoebe Buffay: And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Duncan: Her name's Debra.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Duncan: Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Phoebe Buffay: Sure.
Duncan: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
Phoebe Buffay: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Duncan: I'm, I'm still me.
Phoebe Buffay: Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
