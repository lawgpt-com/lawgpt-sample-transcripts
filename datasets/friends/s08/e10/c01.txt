Chandler Bing: New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
Monica Geller: Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!
Monica Geller: I know.
Chandler Bing: I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
Monica Geller: I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
Chandler Bing: She had a point.
Rachel Green: Hi!
Monica Geller: Hey.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Monica Geller: They're mine!
Chandler Bing: Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
Rachel Green: Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
Monica Geller: Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Chandler Bing: I have you.
Monica Geller: Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
