THE COURT:

On oral argument, the record having

3

been closed at the end of last week's hearing, I know

4

there's been some back and forth by the parties as to the

5

time allotted, as opposed to the actual issues and the order

6

in which they would be heard.

7

really is the appropriate subject of a -- any sort of

8

additional conference or discussion.

9

time the parties are going to take.

I don't actually think this

This meaning, how much
Ultimately oral

10

argument is for the Court's benefit.

11

received lengthy, in fact, over the page limit, although I

12

authorized it, briefing on most of these issues, including

13

the one that the parties propose taking the most time on.

14

I'll just cut people off if they're being repetitive.

15

The Court has already

So, I'm happy to begin with oral argument, unless

16

there's any other announcement that the parties would like

17

to make.

18

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, good morning, for the

19

record, Marshall Huebner, Davis Polk & Wardwell, on behalf

20

of the Debtors.

Can I be heard and seen clearly?

21

THE COURT:

22

MR. HUEBNER:

Yes.
Terrific.

Thank you, Your Honor.

23

Your Honor, before we actually start oral argument, in our

24

other capacity as just resharing and stewards of the cases,

25

we have three things to announce on what the Court, through

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

it and others, these things more or less, two of them

2

appeared on the docket, but it is important, I think,

3

because it does narrow the issues.

4

The newest piece of news is that Dr. Rothfein and

5

his client, the Emergency Room Physician, we have reached a

6

settlement, and so their issues are going to be resolved.

7

That settlement has the support of the AHC and the MSGE, and

8

the UCC does not expect any problem in approving it.

9

essentially, on its face, contemplates a $375,000 broadly

It

10

supported substantial contribution claim for the work that

11

the doctor and his counsel have done.

12

changes, obviously, into some of the issues that they

13

raised, periodically throughout the case, and with that,

14

that issue is resolved and needs no other further

15

discussion, nor oral argument.

16

There have been some

We will, obviously, file appropriate papers as we

17

did with, for example, Mr. Stuart (indiscernible), resolving

18

their objections, and again, we already have, I believe, the

19

support we need since I was able to note is the residual

20

money that the Debtors hope to be able to make available to

21

abatement, or it goes to non-Federal Governmental creditors,

22

and so between the UCC, AHC, and MSG, those are all of the

23

organized groups, essentially, whose representatives, in

24

essence, having their recoveries diminished by that amount

25

and they are all either supportive over all or they

212-267-6868

(indiscernible) supported.

2

of one box, I'll have it can make to (indiscernible)

3

chambers.

4

So hopefully we can -- one third

I would like to apologize to the NCSG and the two

5

halves, or really 62 percent and 37 percent, who just did

6

not have time, this only happened a few minutes ago, but

7

although, Peter (indiscernible) and Mr. (indiscernible), by

8

seeming looking happy on the webcam, as Your Honor was

9

walking out.

He obviously he will explain this either to

10

Mr. Troop, if he is still representing the full group, per

11

this is other than confirmation, to which I believe he is,

12

plus obviously, happened to talk to any individual non-

13

consenting states, but, you know, to say it in its more

14

simple form, we would probably save more for these very

15

creditors by not continuing to wrestle with these issues,

16

but an opinion contemplates, which is one of many reasons

17

why we believe the settlement is appropriate.

18

no party is offended, but we’re desperately looking to

19

settle things, and my other attorneys that were on phone

20

calls, literally this happened, Mr. McClammy stepped out and

21

made these phone calls in about the last 120 seconds, and so

22

this is about as hot and breaking a piece of news as one

23

could possibly have.

24

THE COURT:

25

Okay.

I hope that

So just to -- just to be clear,

this is a -- an agreement to support a substantial

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 18
1

contribution claim in that amount?

2

MR. HUEBNER:

Mr. McClammy, please keep me honest,

3

is that correct?

That's what I've been told.

4

- literally just happened.

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

We got this -

Okay.

Your Honor, the second piece of good

7

news, and I'm about to turn over the podium, because I think

8

both of the next two things are from Mr. Vonnegut, they are

9

complicated and -- and not for me, I have no capacity and

10

ability to describe them, are that we have settled with the

11

DMP's.

12

letting the Court knows it avoided needing to -- oh, it's

13

not a full settlement, but Mr. Vonnegut will walk us through

14

it.

15

through is taking our cue as we have from the first moment

16

of this case, both from what creditors and other

17

stakeholders articulate to us, as their needs and concerns

18

and issues, and of course, listening to the Court as be as

19

we know how.

20

night last night, because there has been negotiating until

21

moments before it was filed, amended documents that I do

22

believe narrow and change a variety of things that have been

23

the subject of objections, and so, probably to avoid

24

inaccuracy, which would help no one, I think I will probably

25

sit down and ask Mr. Vonnegut to walk the Court and parties,

And this is a very material development in the case,

And then the third thing, which he will also walk us

212-267-6868

We did file, I believe in the middle of the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 19
1

and Ms. Deedee, I'm sure, will keep him honest of the DMP

2

side, where we are on those two issues, and then after that

3

we can turn to oral argument on the --

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

I -- I did see the eighth

5

amended plan, and I -- actually, I was a little late getting

6

onto the bench because I was reviewing the black line.

7

I'm happy to hear a brief explanation of the settlement with

8

the, so called, DMP group.

9

MR. VONNEGUT:

But

Good morning, Your Honor, for the

10

record, I'm Eli Vonnegut of the Davis Polk & Wardwell, on

11

behalf of the Debtors, can you hear me clearly?

12

THE COURT:

Yes, thanks.

13

MR. VONNEGUT:

Thank you.

So to respect the

14

allocation of time for argument, I will only be giving a

15

factual explanation of the plan revisions that were filed

16

overnight.

17

Those revisions, in the eighth amended plan, fall

18

into a few principal categories.

19

agreed to with the distributors, manufacturers, and

20

pharmacies, I will call them the DMP's to resolve the bulk

21

of their objections to the plan. On this I will be

22

describing only the agreed revisions.

23

Jeffrey Gleit of Sullivan, and Worcester, is acting as

24

conflicts counsel for the Debtor, with respect to the sole

25

component that the DMP's objection that remains unresolved,

212-267-6868

First, we have revisions

My co-counsel,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 20
1

and he will be addressing that later in argument.

2

Next we have revisions to the release provisions

3

to attempt to narrow concerns that have been raised, and

4

also, hopefully just to make it a little easier to

5

understand the releases.

6

miscellaneous changes that I will just cover very briefly.

7

Lastly, there are three

So first, with respect to the DMP settlement, the

8

agreement reached with the DMP's resolves all aspects of

9

their objections other than those related to the Debtor's

10

insurance policies, which Mr. Gleit will be addressing

11

later.

12

bilateral release.

13

co-defendant claims against the Debtors, and to the

14

assumption of their contracts without payment of those

15

claims.

16

claims against the DMP's, including those that arise under

17

the assumed contract and to remove the DMP's from the

18

schedule of excluded parties.

19

The crux of the agreement is very simple.

It's a

The DMP's have agreed to release their

The Debtors, in turn, have agreed to release their

The DMP's have also now been added to the

20

reciprocal release, meaning that they receive a release from

21

the Sacklers and the other shareholder release parties.

22

There are a couple exceptions to this overall framework.

23

Both the Debtors and the DMP's preserve their ordinary

24

course, claims that are not related to opioid litigation,

25

and as before, all holders of co-defendant claims, continue

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 21
1

to retain what we call their co-defendant defensive rights.

2

Those are rights that they have to attempt to reduce their

3

liabilities, judgements, or obligations, but those co-

4

defendant, defensive rights cannot be used to seek or obtain

5

any affirmative recovery from any protected party.

6

Mechanically, this settlement is implemented in a

7

few different places in the plan.

In Section 4.16, which

8

covers the treatment of co-defendant claims, we've just

9

simplified this a lot.

It now just says that co-defendant

10

claimholders don't receive any distributions but do retain

11

their defensive rights.

12

co-defendant contracts, contracts that have -- that give

13

rise to co-defendant claims.

14

agreements are assumed with all co-defendant claims arising

15

under those contracts, having been released.

16

Unless, Your Honor, has any questions about the
DMP settlement --

10

THE COURT:

I did have -- I did have a question,

11

you describe this essentially as a mutual release of claims

12

with the exceptions for ordinary course claims, and the

13

like, so given that, there is no third-party release of the

14

DMP's under the plan?

15

against them, that's not being released?

16

If someone has a third-party claim

MR. VONNEGUT:

The DMP's are now removed from the

17

excluded party schedule, which means that if they are -- if

18

they are a released party in other capacities, that they

19

would be included in the third-party release, by virtue of

20

having them removed from the excluded party schedule.

21

THE COURT:

See I -- I don't understand that

22

provision.

23

the DMP group, but there's pending litigation against

24

distributors and manufacturers, it's not stayed by me,

25

around the country, including in the MDL, and I wouldn't

There are -- I'm not sure who is included within

think that the plan would be able to release them in that

2

litigation.

3

MR. VONNEGUT:

I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

No,

4

that litigation is -- is not released.

So in -- in the

5

definition of released parties, I actually, in the inserted

6

language, clause 3, Subsection B, the settling co-defendants

7

and their related parties are become released parties for

8

Section 10.6A, which is the release granted by the Debtor.

9

THE COURT:

Okay.

10

MR. TROOP:

Your Honor, Andrew Troop, on behalf of

11

the Non-Consenting States --

12

THE COURT:

Go ahead.

13

MR. TROOP:

-- thank you for asking my question.

14

But it seems to me that the plan should be perfectly clear

15

about this (indiscernible) --

16

THE COURT:

I -- I agree.

I just wanted to make

17

sure I understood the intent.

18

did point me, correctly, to the fact that that for purposes

19

of the definition, it's just for 1.06, but I think you

20

probably should beef that up, because just based on the

21

breadth of the third-party litigation around the country,

22

there shouldn't be any confusion on this point.

23
24

MR. VONNEGUT:

I think you do, Mr. Vonnegut,

clarify that.

MS. STEEGE:

Your Honor, this is Catherine Steege,

2

on behalf of the DMP's, I think no one thought to go through

3

the language, it is very clear that the relief they're

4

receiving is from the Debtor and from the Sackler

5

shareholder parties, or whatever that terms is.

6

in --

THE COURT:

8

MS. STEEGE:

9

parties are released from this.

10

THE COURT:

It does not

I think --- in any way suggest that other

I think that's right, but I -- I

11

understand that to be the case, but since the third-party

12

release also uses the term, released parties, maybe -- I

13

mean, my suggestion might be that you drop a footnote in the

14

definition of released parties where it says in Section

15

10.6A, and just make it clear that -- that this is the

16

Debtor release and not any third-party release.

The other point, Your Honor, I'd make

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 25
1

about the withdrawal of our objection to the plan, is we

2

have preserved one objection, which is the objection to the

3

provisions that only insurance flights, we've agreed to rest

4

on our brief's in connection with that objection.

5

addition, many of the DMP's are involved in litigation up in

6

Canada, or are only involved in Canadian litigation, and

7

they all reserve their rights to make the appropriate

8

arguments in the Canadian courts, including in the

9

recommended decision.

10
11

THE COURT:

In

With respect to -- with respect to

what?

12

MS. STEEGE:

With respect to preservation of their

13

defensive rights up there and there are other issues up

14

there that interplay with the litigation that they need to

15

be able to argue in the Canadian Courts.

16

THE COURT:

But I just want to make sure, is it

17

the preservation of their rights goes to the reserved issue

18

here that the parties have briefed as to rights to

19

insurance, and the -- and the carveout for their defenses

20

judgement reduction, those sorts of points?

21

MS. STEEGE:

22

THE COURT:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
All right.

Not that they will --

23

then we argue in Canada, in the recognition proceeding, the

objection that they've waived here?

20

MR. VONNEGUT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Next I will

21

outline the revisions made to the release provisions on our

22

few miscellaneous changes.

23

like to revisit, briefly the basic architecture of the

24

releases, I think it's -- it's helpful in understanding

25

them.

212-267-6868

So on the releases, I'd just

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 27
1

In order to be released, a claim has to be first,

2

held by a releasing party.

Second, asserted against either

3

a released party or a shareholder released party, and third,

4

based on relating to or arising from, in full or in-part,

5

the Debtors, their states, or the in the Chapter 11 cases.

6

It also has to be not held by the federal government, not

7

against an excluded party and not an excluded claim.

8

The simplest revisions to the releases that we

9

made fall into the category of just fixing bad drafting,

10

that tends to result when you have a document being

11

commented on by as many intensely interested parties as we

12

have in this case.

13

duplicative language; in many cases we've attempted to

14

streamline use of defining terms, like cause of action.

15

won't go through that in detail, unless, Your Honor, has any

16

questions.

17

So you'll see, throughout, we've removed

I

Sections 10.6 and 10.7, they've gotten a lot

18

shorter, and we hope a lot clearer.

19

duplicative or otherwise unnecessary language, and our core

20

standard in sections 10.6 and 10.7 is that in order to be

21

released, the cause of action must be based on or relating

22

to, or in any manner arising from, in whole or in part, the

23

Debtors, the estates, or the Chapter 11 cases, and we have a

24

parenthetical illustrating certain types of claims that

25

might relate to the Debtors, but that does not expand their

212-267-6868

We've removed

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 28
1

provision in any way.

2

to the Debtors.

3

substantively changing the scope, we're just trying to make

4

things a little bit easier to read.

5

Those claims still all have to relate

We don't do any of those revisions as

On the more substantive side, we have revised both

6

what is an excluded claim and who is a shareholder released

7

party, to attempt to address concerns about the breadth of

8

the releases.

9

two most substantive additions are 1) mindful of, Your

So in the definition of excluded claim, the

10

Honor's commentary and input from creditors regarding claims

11

related to non-opioid issues.

12

releases non-opioid related claims against shareholder

13

released parties, or those shareholder released parties on

14

willful misconduct.

15

impact this.

16

constitutes willful misconduct, and what constitutes a

17

willful non-opioid claim, which is a non-opioid claim

18

arising from willful misconduct.

19

We've now excluded from the

There are a set of definitions that

We've added new defining terms for what

We also heard concerns regarding the breadth of

20

the releases for advisors and contractors of the Sacklers,

21

and so we have also excluded claims against those parties

22

for their own willful misconduct, regardless of whether they

23

are opioid related or not opioid related.

24

again, is founded on the definition of willful misconduct

25

and the term for those claims that are excluded is willful

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

That provision,

516-608-2400

Page 29
1

party related claim, which means a claim against a

2

shareholder, released party that is identified in Subsection

3

VII(b) of Shareholder released party or such parties,

4

actually and separate, willful misconduct.

5

it's their own conduct, not conduct that was imputed to

6

them.

7

And that means

Both of these provisions have a deep keeping

8

function pertinent to the plan to provide some protection

9

against strike suits.

This lives in new Section 11.01(e),

10

and that requires a claimant that believes they have a claim

11

that fits one of these carveouts, before they prosecute that

12

claim, to first come to the bankruptcy court and make a

13

showing that their claim is both colorable and within one of

14

the two definitions.

15

Also, in excluded claim, we did some less

16

substantive cleanup to just try to address some provisions

17

that seem to have been causing confusion.

18

made clear that nobody is getting income tax claims

19

released.

20

use to apply to only to shareholder released parties and

21

make -- and made it global, just to make clear what we're

22

doing there.

First in II, we

This was always the case, but we took apart that

23

Next in V, we eliminated a provision that only

24

applied to releases among different shareholder released

25

parties.

212-267-6868

That now lives in its own provision in Section

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 30
1

10.7(b), and lastly, we excluded any cause of action based

2

on conduct after the effective date.

3

the case, but there were a lot of questions about future

4

conduct during the -- during the presentation of evidence,

5

so we just wanted to make that very clear.

6

This again was always

Next in the definition of shareholder released

7

party.

We've heard concerns about the scope of releases for

8

transferees of the Sacklers, and so in VI, we have

9

simplified that prong so that persons in which the Sackler's

10

own an interest are no longer released parties, and we've

11

replaced that with a provision for mediate and immediate

12

transferees of the Sacklers, but that is very strictly

13

limited to make clear that those parties are only released

14

in their capacity as such, and only for the amounts that

15

they received.

16

Other revisions to that -- that term, were just

17

clarifying and we did not give a substantives.

18

Honor, has any questions, I can briefly cover the -- the few

19

other revisions that were made to the plan.

20
21

THE COURT:

Okay.

Unless, Your

I -- I had a couple of

questions on this topic.

22

MR. VONNEGUT:

23

THE COURT:

Sure.

First, in the definition of willful

24

misconduct, it -- it comes under an action taken or not

25

taken in bad faith and with actual knowledge that such

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 31
1

action or failure to act is unlawful, prohibited, or false,

2

and will be harmful to another.

3

the word fraud, and much of the litigation here, asserts

4

fraud claims, one way or another, including under Consumer

5

Protection Act statutes, and I just want to make sure is

6

fraud included within this?

7
8

MR. VONNEGUT:

It -- it doesn't include

Well, I don't want to get ahead of

Mr. Uzzi, who looks like he's ready to address that.

9

MR. UZZI:

Your Honor, for the record, Gerard

10

Uzzi, Milbank, on behalf of the Raymond Sackler Family.

It

11

was actually rose to address just a clarification on the --

12

the prior statements with which I -- which I can address,

13

but to answer this question.

14

we mean what we say here.

15

up fraud.

Your Honor, I -- I -- I think

It's not intended to -- to pick

It's intended to pick up what it says here.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. UZZI:

I think you should pick up fraud.
All right.

Understood, Your Honor.

We

18

will -- we will -- we will take -- we will discuss that with

19

our clients, Your Honor.

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. UZZI:

Okay.
The clarification I wanted to make,

22

Your Honor, is Mr. Vonnegut had made -- we made -- we made a

23

correction as it relates to -- I'm sorry, I'm just flipping

24

the page to get there, Your Honor, but the definition of

25

shareholder of these parties, as it related to transferees

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 32
1

and we did clarify that and we limited that language, but

2

Mr. Vonnegut made a statement that we had taken out the

3

reference to Sackler owned entities, that's true as a

4

cleanup comment, but that's just simply because it's picked

5

up later in the definition as far as a catchall for

6

subsidiaries and controlled affiliates.

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. UZZI:

9

THE COURT:

Right.
So it was a cleanup on transferees.
The purpose -- the purposes of this

10

change was to limit the release to -- to those that would be

11

otherwise sued, as being the recipient of a fraudulent

12

transfer that's released under the plan, right, and in that

13

accord --

14
15

MR. UZZI:

Correct, Your Honor -- correct, Your

Honor.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. UZZI:

18

THE COURT:

All right.
Or similar theories.
Right.

Okay.

All right.

The

19

other -- the other point I had is a much smaller one, and

20

again, I'm not -- I'm just trying to understand what's in

21

here, I'm not -- I'm not commenting the merits of the

22

changes or whether they're enough.

23

the work done to narrow the release.

24

paragraph of 10.6, I think there's -- I think there's

25

potential for a little confusion in the fourth line there.

212-267-6868

Although, I appreciate
If you go to the last

It says, in each case, unrelated to the Chapter 11 cases or

2

the subject matter of the pending opioid actions, I think

3

you probably should put unrelated, and then add the word

4

either to the Chapter 11 cases or to, I think that's

5

supposed to be disjunctive, right?

6

one of those two or both?

7

MR. UZZI:

8

THE COURT:

9
10

It's unrelated to either

Yes, sir, that's right.
All right.

I had to read that a

couple of times to figure that out and I think that would
make it clearer.

11

MR. UZZI:

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. UZZI:

We will fix that, Your Honor.
Okay.

Okay.

Your Honor, so, but the last three

14

changes, just to highlight for the Court and the parties,

15

one in continuing foundation members, which describes the

16

individuals that will be appointed to run the two Sackler

17

Family Foundations, we've just removed from -- from that

18

term, the possibility of the Court appointing those people,

19

which the State of New York didn't like and didn't like and

20

frankly we thought the Court might not like, so now that --

21

those foundations will just be run by either the NOAT

22

Trustees or people otherwise agreed to by the Debtors, the

23

governmental consent parties, and counsel for the newly

24

consenting states.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

A good change.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 34
1

MR. UZZI:

Thank you.

In Section 11.1, XVII, we

2

fixed a conflict between the plan and the NOAT and Prime

3

Trust documents regarding jurisdiction over those documents,

4

to make clear that they will be concurrent and not exclusive

5

bankruptcy court jurisdiction over those entities.

6

lastly, to conform to the revisions to the confirmation

7

order, we've removed the waiver of the 14 days stay imposed

8

under Rule 3020, from 9.2, and we adjusted Section 12.8 to

9

conform there.

MR. FOGELMAN:

And

Okay.
And that is it, Your Honor.
Okay.

Very well.

Your Honor, Lawrence Fogelman from

14

the US Attorney's office.

15

(indiscernible), we did get a draft on Saturday of some of

16

the changes, but just this morning when we woke up, a lot of

the changes that we had discussed over the weekend weren't

there, and some others were different.

deals with the releases, which are an important part to what

20

my offices has been the states, and the Debtors in our

21

office don't necessarily always agree on interpretation of

22

the same language.

did not mean to suggest that they resolved anybody's

14

THE COURT:

We want to be able to look at those

That -- that's fair, but I also think

15

it's helpful to confine the oral argument on this point to

the actual wording of the plan, at this point.

said, may or may not be sufficiently narrow.

18

MR. FOGELMAN:

19

THE COURT:

20

21

Which, as I

think I will turn the podium over to Mr. Huebner.

for the Non-consenting States, just -- just quickly on this

25

point.

212-267-6868

I have not objected, nor have I reserved any time as

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 36
1

part of the oral argument, but in light of this particular

2

change, there is a question that has been raised about the

3

formulation with regard to what the third-parties and state

4

law, that a Uniformed Deceptive Trade Practices, I have to

5

thank for the uniform one, that -- that imposes liability

6

without there having to be a proof of willful misconduct or

7

fraud, and so we may need to fold some time in for me when

8

other parties are talking about releases or later, as I come

9

up to speed on that particular issue.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

11

MR. TROOP:

If that's fine with everyone, just to

THE COURT:

That's fine. I mean, I think -- I

12

be clear.

13
14

mean, my view on this is that when you're covering related

15

parties, which are independent contractors, co-promotors,

16

third-party sales representatives, medical liaisons,

17

subcontractors, agents, and the like, it's a big step

18

forward to carve out the defined term, willful misconduct,

19

but there may well be other types of misconduct that should

20

fit into that definition.

21

conduct that is wrongful is what is really meant by that

22

language, and if an applicable law covers that, as opposed

23

to just some form of strict liability, because you're in the

24

-- in the same room or the same building, then I think it

25

probably should be covered by the carve out.

212-267-6868

I think, generally, independent

MR. TROOP:

review that language again and make a proposal to the

3

Debtors before the close of argument on Wednesday, so that

admission.

2

only two purposes and no others, abatement of the opioid

3

crisis and compensation of the individual victims, to save,

4

ameliorate, and improve as many human lives as possible in

5

the face of one of the worst health crises in world history.

6

If we do no seize this opportunity, if we squander

7

this moment, billions of dollars, and the creation of a

8

public benefit company, all dedicated to abatement of the

9

opioid crisis will be lost.

10

The legal inquiry at the heart of this hearing is

11

whether the many interlocking, interdependent settlements

12

embodied in the Plan and the releases are "fair and

13

equitable" in the best interests of the estates, which of

14

course, include their stakeholders, consistent the Supreme

15

Court's TMT Trailer decision and the seven Iridium factors.

16

The Plan is a tighten woven tapestry of no fewer

17

than 14 incredibly complex and totally mutually dependent

18

sets of settlements among tens of thousands of the Debtors'

19

creditors, including:

applied to the facts.

14

At face, the Sackler aspect of the settlement

involves the giving of releases and getting $4.325 billion

the massive overwhelming fact record in favor of

3

Please allow me now to turn to the Iridium factors

4

which will frame out the necessity and propriety of these

5

releases.

6

Factor one, the balance between the litigation's

7

possibility of success and the settlement's future benefits.

8

The enormous, monumental, varied benefits of the Plan

9

settlements are undeniable and unobtainable other than under

10

the Plan.

As so many parties have advised in their briefs,

11

and testified under oath, and the UCC has it in their

12

letter, the Plan is the only, only viable solution that can

13

provide this extraordinary set of benefits to the

14

stakeholders of this case and the American people.

15

Among these benefits:

16

1.

The preservation and dedication of 100

17

percent of the Debtors' very material assets to opioid

18

abatement and victims, all while maintaining continuity of

19

supply of the many medicines made by the Debtors to ensure

20

access for appropriate patients, subject to comprehensive

21

covenants and injunctions and under the oversight of both a

22

monitor and a new Board of Directors.

23

2.

Comprehensive resolution of all claims

24

relating to these Debtors, thereby avoiding years and

25

probably decades of intercreditor and other litigation.

general is legally bound to deposit settlement monies in

22

23

Next, the complete removal of the Sackler families

24

from any and all involvement with Purdue or its assets from

25

the end of 2018 until the end of time.

Next, the Sackler families' exit from the opioid

Now, please let me turn to Iridium factor two.
The likelihood of complex and protracted litigation with its

attendant expense, inconvenience and delay, including the

difficulty in collecting on the judgment.

probably happily for all, I actually will be quite brief on

this point because from Page 69 to Page 103 of our

and tie it to the record evidence that is now undisputed

way did you do it -- of a over 120,000 voting creditors, the

the Plan.

margins, and every single one of the 10 ad hoc groups and

In dramatic, dramatic contrast, the objectors to

collectively comprise less than one, five-hundredth of one

The nature and breadth of the releases

that the plan must have third-party releases and could never

go effective without them because, Your Honor, even if the

18

Sacklers agreed to pay over four billion dollars and still

be sued for hundreds of billions of dollars, the plan dies.

This has been totally misunderstood by so many parties.

It's time to hopefully make it clear.

The objecting states are singularly focused on the

But this is only one of the very many reasons

22

Why would the plan never, ever work, irrespective

of the wishes of the Sacklers without third-party releases?

24

One, fundamental fairness and equal treatment.

25

Let us consider arguendo, a world in which the objecting

and the District of Columbia have filed proofs of claim

The nine objecting states

7

Let us assume that they recover only 5 percent of

8

the 439 billion dollars they say they are owed and they get

9

judgments for 22 billion dollars.

Even if the Sacklers

10

somehow could pay both this 22 billion dollars, which is

11

only 5 percent of the claims they've sworn they have, and

12

also the 4.326 billion for the whole rest of the country,

13

that would mean that only nine states and D.C. get 22

14

every other Ad Hoc Group is supposed to share only 4.325

That does not and could not ever work for

But, of course, it's much worse than that because

19

the Sacklers don't have 26.325 billion dollars to pay 22 and

20

then another 4.325.

21

So in this hypothetical opt-out scenario, even if

the objecting states only get judgment for five cents of

what they claim they are owed, everything will fail and

collapse if the Sacklers can't pay the settlement.

As the Court has recognized repeatedly and, in

22

fact, as recently has the final pretrial conference, the law

23

governing the availability of third-party releases is well

24

established in this Circuit dating back to the 1980s since

injunction plays an important part in the Debtor's

The centerpiece of the plan, as we just heard, is

the 4.325 billion in cash that the Sacklers will contribute

in exchange for these third-party releases.

Fourth, and last, but certainly not least, some

11

voting creditors have voted to accept the plan.

12

specifically, over 96 percent of domestic government

13

entities that voted have voted to accept the plan.

14

that roughly 80 percent of the States support the plan would

15

be more than sufficient level of support even in an

16

injunction where channel classes must vote in favor of a

The fact

19

This takes me to the remainder of the arguments

20

raised by the objecting states, the U.S. Trustee, and the

21

DOJ, all of which boil down to nothing more than an attack

22

on well-established Second Circuit law.

23

basically fall into four buckets.

24
25

Their arguments

First, third-party releases should not be
permitted under the bankruptcy code.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 71
1

Second, even if third-party releases are

2

authorized by law, this Court should craft a new exception

3

to Metromedia for the so-called police power actions.

4

Third, they argue that third-party releases cannot

5

be imposed because they violate due process, which, as Your

6

Honor will see, is really just their first argument recast

7

as a constitutional argument.

8
9
10

And finally, they argue this Court lacks
jurisdiction or power to confirm the plan containing these
releases.

11

Now each of these arguments are meritless.

Let me

12

begin with the first bucket of arguments which are just an

13

attack on Metromedia itself, and I'll be brief.

14

Along these lines, the DOJ and U.S. Trustee, for

15

example, claim that a third-party release should not be

16

allowed in any case other than asbestos case because the

17

only provision under the code expressly and specifically

18

authorizing the injunction of third-party claims, Section

19

524(g), is limited to asbestos cases.

Note that there is no

Page 72

public benefit corporation, and public health initiatives

2

that the DOJ fully supports, but would disappear, simply

3

disappear if the objection is sustained.

4

The objectors also claim that third-party releases

5

should be categorically prohibited as they operate as a

6

broader discharge than would be available to a Debtor.

7

Suffice to say though that the Second Circuit indisputably

8

permits non-consensual third-party releases under

9

appropriate circumstances, as do the majority of Circuits.

10

And the Second Circuit on Page 142 of Metromedia actually

11

addresses both of these arguments, the 524(g) argument and

12

the discharge argument and nonetheless concludes that third-

13

party releases are permissible.

14

So I will not spend more time on these particular

15

arguments unless the Court has any questions because the

16

Court of Appeals has already decided this issue.

17

Now, the second argument raised by the objecting

18

states is that even if Metromedia is good law, this Court

19

should essentially craft an exception to it for the

20

objecting states so-called police power claims, the

21

automatic stay police power exception in 362(d)(4) for

22

governmental units.

23

Now, let's be clear what about the objecting

24

states are asking for when they seek the creation of a carve

25

out from Metromedia for their claims.

212-267-6868

They are seeking a

veto power that would effectively allow them or any one of

2

them to decide whether the plan may be confirmed even though

3

a super-majority of the states and over 95 percent of voting

4

creditors have said that it should.

5

And to be clear, this requested police power veto

6

would not be limited just to states.

7

make much of their supposedly unique sovereign status, but

8

the Bankruptcy Code makes no categorical distinction between

9

them and their political subdivisions.

10

The Objecting States

The definition of governmental unit under the Code

11

also includes any "district, territory, municipality,

12

foreign state, or any department, agency or instrumentality

13

of the state."

14

police power claims brought by governmental units, each and

15

every one of these entities would also have a unilateral

16

power to impede in otherwise consensual and value-maximizing

resolution, even if, say, every single state in the country

2

It is therefore unsurprising that the objectors

3

cannot cite a single authority, not one, remotely suggesting

4

that there is or should be an exception to Metromedia for

5

police powers.

6

Now, the Objecting States say that their consumer

released because enforcement of their laws is

9

"constitutionally protected function", or because states are

10

"independent sovereigns in the Federal system or because

12

enforce non-monetary interests."

13

authorities on which they rely come close to establishing

14

that their claims should be treated any differently from

15

others.

But none of the

And the

2

Objecting States, of course, do not dispute that Section 362

3

does not apply to the confirmation context at all.

4

Let's also be clear about something.

Section

5

362(b)(4) creates an exception to the automatic stay for

6

governmental units' enforcement of police and regulatory

7

power, but not to the collection of money judgments.

8

make no mistake, the Objecting States are seeking not only

9

to enforce their laws, but also to collect on any judgment

resulting recoveries with any other states.

for abatement purposes, or to only those deposit recoveries

In reality, the carveout they seek is instead just

line to pursue their billion dollar money damages claims for

23

abatement-centric enterprise, the entire value-maximizing

2

11

They also cite 28 U.S.C. 1452(a), which governs

12

the removal of police power actions to federal court.

But

13

that is irrelevant.

14

15

pursuit of those claims under 105(a) as part of a plan of

16

reorganization.

The issue here is not whether this

It's a different issue.

17

The Objecting States also say an exception to

18

Metromedia should be gleaned or implied from 523(a)(7),

19

which makes claims for fines, penalties or forfeiture

20

against individuals nondischargeable.

earlier, Metromedia considered this general concern and

rejected it as a basis to bar third-party releases

categorically.

the critical determination are not public health officials,

21

but rather bankruptcy professionals.

22

That is false.

decision to support the plan was made by thousands of

elected officials, including the Attorney General of the

Now, in the cross-examination of Ms. Finegan,
counsel for the U.S. Trustee seemed to make much of the fact

10

that neither the publication version nor the plain-language

12

what else could be done to make this point more plain.

21

Indeed, I would respectfully submit that if the Debtors were

22

to have included the full text of the releases and full list

23

of shareholder release parties, that notice would not have

24

been nearly as effective, or easily understood, and I'm sure

25

the Court would agree.

212-267-6868

It said it loud and clear.

It's

not clear to me

516-608-2400

Page 88

The record is also crystal clear that the reach of

2

the -- crystal clear as to the reach of the supplemental

3

confirmation hearing notice plan and how effective it was.

4

It was conducted in 27 different languages, served over 3.6

5

billion online and social media impressions, and resulted in

6

over 3,700 news stories across the U.S. and Canada.

7

Your Honor, this was all in addition to the extensive bar

8

date notice and plans.

9

And

On this truly extraordinary record, set out in

10

even more detail in our papers, and in the absence of any

11

evidence to the contrary, there can be no doubt that the

12

holders of release claims received adequate notice, both of

13

these bankruptcy proceedings and the general bar date, and

14

that there claims against the Sackler Families and related

15

entities would be released under the plan.

16

Finally, Your Honor, just a minute on this,

17

because Your Honor know this better than anybody.

18

objectors, including the Objecting States, the U.S. Trustee

19

and the DOJ, claim that this Court lacks even the power to

20

enter an order approving the plan or the third-party

21

releases, including because the Court lacks jurisdiction

22

under Section 1334, statutory authority under Section 157,

23

or constitutional authority under Stern v. Marshall.

24

each of these arguments is meritless and this is just going

25

over well-tread case law.

Now,

516-608-2400

Page 89
1

Let me begin with the Court's subject matter

2

jurisdiction, because it frankly is not controversial in the

3

least, that this Court has jurisdiction to approve the

4

third-party releases.

5

jurisdiction over all civil proceedings that are arising

6

under or arising in cases under Title 11 U.S.C. 1334(b).

7

Congress granted comprehensive

Confirmation of a plan of reorganization is

8

without a doubt a proceeding that arises under or arises in

9

a case under Title 11.

And as Judge McMahon explained in

10

the Tier 1 case, this does not change merely because a plan

11

would contain third-party releases.

12

explained, and I quote, "A confirmed reorganization plan

13

that includes such releases does not address the merits of

14

the claims being released. . . rather, it effectively

15

cancels those claims so as to permit a total reorganization

16

of the Debtors' total affairs in a manner available only in

17

bankruptcy."

As Judge McMahon

18

She continues, "That a bankruptcy court's decision

19

may have a preclusive incidental effect on claims beyond the

20

scope of the immediate bankruptcy proceeding does not render

21

the bankruptcy court jurisdiction non-core, i.e., outside

22

the arising under grant of jurisdiction."

23

Now, the Objecting States' only response is that

24

Kerwin did not address a release of so-called police power

25

claims.

212-267-6868

But that, of course, is analytically irrelevant.

6

related to jurisdiction also provides a separate basis for

approving the third-party releases as part of a plan.

And even if the

8

As set out at length in our papers, Your Honor,

9

the release claims and shareholder claims without a doubt

10

have an all you need -- "a conceivable effect on the

11

estates, either because such claims will result in a

12

diminution of the Debtors' insurance policies, or would

13

result in an indemnification or contribution claims, or

14

would potentially prejudice the rights of the MPT and future

15

Snap Act litigation.

16

That brings us to the last set of arguments raised

17

only by the U.S. Trustee and the DOJ, that subject matter

19

constitutional authority to enter a final order confirming

Those suggestions are meritless.

is clearly a core proceeding under Section 157(b)(2)(l).

Confirmation of the plan

Numerous courts, including the Kerwin court and

24

this one, have held that where, as here, a Bankruptcy Court

25

considers nonconsensual third-party releases in connection

with plan confirmation, it acts pursuant to its core

2

statutory authority, and thus has the statutory power to

enter a final order.

4

That's Kerwin case, 592 BR at 504.

Similarly, there can be no doubt that the Court

also has constitutional authority to enter a final order

7

to supplement the very substantial, effective and

8

comprehensive presentations made by Mr. Huebner and Mr.

9

Kaminetzky.

10

And I would like

Your Honor, I think as you have heard from all of

11

the presenters, this case is truly unprecedented.

12

if ever, has the Bankruptcy Court been called upon to

13

address matters of such public importance, both to the

14

states, municipalities, tribes and other non-federal

15

governmental creditors represented in this case by the Ad

16

Hoc Committee and to the public at large.

17

Rarely,

Your Honor, the opioid crisis is a horrible and

18

intractable public health emergency, one that the members of

19

the Ad Hoc Committee have been working arduously to address

20

for many years, together with many other constituents who

21

have been active in this Chapter 11 case.

22

This plan is a concrete step towards a resolution,

23

a vehicle to attempt to address this national health crisis

24

in an extremely creative and constructive manner.

25

centerpiece of the plan is a voluntary agreement by the

Sackler Family to turn over the Purdue business, including

2

all of its insurance policies, as well as contribute an

3

additional $4.325 billion to their creditors, and the

4

related agreements by the public and private creditors to

5

devote substantially all of the plan proceeds to abate the

6

opioid crisis.

7

There is no precedent for such a Chapter 11 plan.

8

And the fact that the parties have agreed to this

9

arrangement, with overwhelming consensus, in and of itself

10

is a remarkable achievement.

11

The plan, importantly, is a global settlement of

12

many disparate issues and it required multiple integrated

13

agreements to get there.

14

financial settlement with the Sackler Family and the

15

agreement by creditors to contribute essentially all of the

16

settlement monies to abatement.

17

There is, as just mentioned, the

But there are also other crucial component parts

18

of the settlement, including the detailed agreement among

19

the States and Local Governments and Tribes as to how the

20

funds will be distributed and employed within states to

21

abate the crisis.

22

There is the allocation among the states, which

23

will be addressed in more detail by my partner, Mr. Wagner,

in a later segment of oral argument.

There is the DOJ settlement, which like the

argument.

10

As the undisputed evidence shows, and as I will

11

highlight, each of these settlements are interrelated and

12

the removal of any piece would jeopardize the plan and the

13

important abatement objectives it serves.

14

Since Mr. Huebner and Mr. Kaminetzky have

15

thoroughly addressed the factual and legal underpinnings of

16

both the settlement and the releases, I will focus on three

17

specific points.

18

First, the dissenting states and others have

19

focused much attention on what the plan arguably takes away

20

from them, including the argument that they are being

21

deprived of the opportunity to have a public airing of their

22

claim against the Sackler Family.

23

objections is what the plan confers on the states and all

24

creditors.

But what is lost in their

Not just by way of monetary compensation and the

Page 96
1

extremely important on their own, but also in terms of how

2

the plan helps to facilitate the very goals that the

3

dissenting states highlight in their objections.

4

The plan does not, as an initial matter, provide

5

criminal (indiscernible).

6

This is a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.

7

substantial financial settlement that dedicates more than $6

8

billion over the life of the settlement to abate the opioid

9

crisis.

10

This is not a criminal trial.
The plan represents a

The plan also provides for an unprecedented public

11

presentation of the history of Purdue's and the Sacklers'

12

involvement in the opioid crisis.

13

is the centerpiece of that presentation.

The document repository

I would point Your Honor to the testimony of Jayne

15

Conroy, who spoke eloquently of the importance of the

16

document repository.

17

August 16th hearing transcript at Pages 83-84.

18

Ms. Conroy, who has been litigating against Purdue for

19

longer than almost anyone, "In addition to any monetary

20

settlement, it could be that the document repository is

21

actually the most valuable piece of this settlement."

That testimony can be found at the

22

This is on top of the testimony elicited through

24

Family and their advisors.

25

parties to go to trial outside of the bankruptcy, it is

212-267-6868

Even if the Court were to allow

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 97
1

inconceivable that the volume of documents that Purdue is

2

committed to disclose through the repository, including

3

documents that are privileged and confidential, would ever

4

become public through a non-bankruptcy proceeding.

5

So at the end of the day, while individual

6

creditors will not have an actual trial on the Purdue or

7

Sackler civil liability, the benefits of the trial are

8

largely achieved in terms of substantial monetary

9

compensation, through the public airing of the facts of the

10

case, and through the injunctive relief that will shut off

11

the dangerous prepetition marketing practices and prevent

12

the Sackler Family from having any continued role in Purdue,

13

and ultimately, the opioid industry.

14

Second, Your Honor, I want to highlight the

15

importance of the third-party release to this case and to

16

the non-governmental creditors who are supporting the plan.

17

Simply put, without a comprehensive release that is binding

18

on all of the states and other public creditors, there

19

simply cannot be a deal that will hold this case.

20

The public creditors that have agreed to the deal

21

have agreed to accept a nine-year payment schedule, with

22

substantial amounts due to the public creditors in years 5-

23

24

structure under which their own recoveries were delayed and

25

in fact exposed to the threat of complete dissipation if

Those settling creditors would never agree to a

Page 98
1

other similarly situated creditors asserting claims in the

2

billions of dollars were allowed to pursue their claims to

3

judgment now against the Sacklers.

4

So putting aside what the Sackers themselves would

5

do, and the testimony is clear that they will not agree to a

6

partial settlement and release, the states and other public

7

creditors would not agree to such a structure either.

8
9

Third, I want to spend a short amount of time
highlighting some of the critical pieces of evidence put

10

into the record by the Ad Hoc Committee witnesses.

This

11

uncontroverted testimony establishes that each of the prongs

12

of the global settlement, and indeed the entire abatement

13

plan, could not survive if any leg of the stool was removed.

14

For instance, as to the interrelated nature of the

15

Sackler settlement and the public-private settlement, Mr.

16

John Guard testified, "Without the availability of the

17

Sackler assets, compromise between the non-federal public

18

claimants and the private claimants would not have been

19

possible, in my opinion.

20

divide that the Sackler contribution gives, it is my opinion

21

that each side would have likely been at an impasse and

22

asserted its various defenses to allowance of the other's

23

claims, and there would've been a lengthy set of estimation

24

hearings in this bankruptcy matter, further dissipating this

25

estate."

212-267-6868

Absent the large pool of assets to

That's the Guard declaration at Paragraph 67.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 99
1

As to the importance of the DOJ settlement, Mr.

2

Guard testified, "The DOJ settlement itself likely would not

3

have been possible absent the Sackler contribution.

4

those funds not been available and the federal government

5

not as interested in monies going to abatement through the

6

states, the states would've had no choice but to fight the

7

allowance of federal government claims to the extent they

8

reduce or eliminate assets available for abatement."

9

the Guard declaration at Paragraph 68.

Had

That's

10

As to the critical issue of whether any states or

11

other parties could "opt out" of the plan without upsetting

12

its delicate balance, Mr. Guard testified, "The Sackler

13

settlement is predicated on the understanding that no state

14

will retain its claims against the Sacklers, and outcome

15

that could cause all other states to revisit allocation and

16

settlement."

17

That's the Guard declaration at Paragraph 71.

The testimony of Jayne Conroy at the August 16th

18

hearing also makes clear that no opt-outs were contemplated,

19

and that the "peace premium" included in the Sackler

20

settlement would not have been available with the prospect

21

of opt-outs.

22

Page 76-77, and at Page 87.

23

That's the August 16th hearing transcript at

As to the role of the attorneys fee resolution in

24

facilitating an abatement plan, Mr. Guard testified, "Absent

25

some sort of attorney fee fund, there would have been no way

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 100
1

to set up an abatement fund because governmental creditors,

2

needing to pay their counsel, could not have relinquished

3

control over monies distributed on account of their claims,

4

and attorneys would not have been comfortable waiving the

5

contractual fees owed to them."

6

declaration at Paragraph 75.

The testimony of Mr. Gary Gotto and Peter

Weinberger is also supportive of this point.

declaration at Paragraph 25(g) and the Weinberger

10

See the Gotto

declaration at Paragraph 49 and Paragraph 59-60.

11

In sum, Your Honor, the plan reflects a global

12

resolution to this Chapter 11 case, with a substantial

13

financial settlement dedicating funds to opioid abatement

14

and a public presentation of the record, unlikely to be

obtained by going to trial.

To be clear, the UCC does not believe the

14

Thank you, Your Honor.

12

course, we’ve just heard a lot of argument and I will do my

13

best, Your Honor, not to repeat any of it but to hit on a

14

couple of points that are important to my group and I think

15

to the case.

16

And, of

As Your Honor knows, I represent the Multistate

17

Governmental Entities Group, a group of approximately 1,300

18

local governmental entities and tribes across 38 states and

19

territories.

20

to highlight in my comments here today is the difficulty of

21

getting to the resolutions reached.

22

took many months of extensive negotiations involving the

23

services of two of the most highly qualified mediators in

24

the country in former Judge Lane Phillips and in Ken

25

Feinberg, to get to the deal we have today.

212-267-6868

And, Your Honor, one thing that I would like

As Your Honor knows, it

As the mediators reported on September 23rd to

2

Your Honor, that mediation resulted in Phase 1, in the

3

agreement that all value received by the state and local

4

governments would be exclusively dedicated to programs

5

designed to abate the opioid crisis, and that such value

6

cannot be used for any other purpose other than an amount

7

8

themselves and to pay legal fees and costs.

9

And that was followed, Your Honor, by Phase 2o of

10

the mediation by those same two esteemed mediators, which

11

resulted, as of March 23, 2021, in a report noting a

12

consensual agreement as to the allocation percentage between

13

and among the public and private creditor groups engaged in

14

the mediation.

15

Your Honor, it also achieved an allocation inter se among

16

the public and private creditor groups, among the

17

overwhelming number of mediation participants.

18

it resulted in a contribution of over $4 billion from the

19

Sackler Family and associated entity, as also noted by that

20

same mediator’s report.

21

As that same mediator’s report also noted,

Of course,

And that was followed, Your Honor, by the able

22

assistance of a sitting a sitting court judge, Judge

23

Chapman, who successfully concluded Phase 3 of the

24

mediation, which resulted in additional funds and additional

25

terms that were favorable to both state and local government

and all private entities.

2

And so, as a result of those very difficult and

3

time-consuming negotiations overseen by extremely able and

4

experienced advisors, the global settlement was reached.

5

Each aspect of that global settlement is a crucial component

6

of the basis of this plan, and all of them are

7

interconnected (indiscernible) a couple of other people

8

9

So, just to make it completely clear, Your Honor,

10

the releases are necessary as part of that global

11

settlement, as part of that global deal for the public

12

creditors and the private creditors to receive the funds

13

they have been allocated under the plan, to put towards

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Sacklers as a whole filed bankruptcy, there would

THE COURT:

So, essentially, you’re ignoring the

14

statements by the representatives of all of the people that

15

spoke today that speak for the roughly 95 percent of the

16

people that voted in favor of the plan?

17

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Your Honor, we don’t believe

18

All of that $11 billion would come in in a bankruptcy -

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

You know, it’s hard to say,

provided -- the Sackler Family has not provided a fulsome

to force a settlement of non-state claims held by creditors

based on the TMT standard that essentially says that if the

settlement does not fall below the lowest in the range of

reasonableness, it should be approved.

MR. GOLDMAN:

11

THE COURT:

Okay.

I just wanted to be sure.

Having said that, it’s not a factor

12

that the courts in the Second Circuit regularly consider, at

13

least expressly as a factor when considering a release of a

14

third party claim.

15

discuss fairness or unfairness.

16

party release should not be unfair.

17

other jurisdictions, fairness does come in in some respects.

18

And it probably does indirectly in the Metromedia factors by

19

focusing on the consideration provided and who it goes to.

20

But in the Third Circuit, they do

Point well taken, Your Honor.

21

I’ll go to the next point that I wanted to respond to.

22

I don’t believe anything said by Mr. Huebner

So

23

justifies overriding the sovereign judgements of nine states

24

and the District of Columbia, that their view of justice and

25

an acceptable resolution with the Sacklers given the amounts

Page 151
1

that they propose to contribute requires a full airing of

2

their alleged culpability in the courts of the objecting

3

states.

4

The very concept of sovereignty requires that the

5

judgements of those states be respected and that they not be

6

forced to give up their property rights against non-debtors

7

by a majority or even a supermajority vote.

8

As Ms. Conroy, who others have invoked earlier,

9

had to acknowledge in her testimony, reasonable minds can

10

differ about the amounts the Sacklers should be contributing

11

in order to get a third-party release.

12

those minds in the he objecting states falling on the side

13

of inadequacy.

14

And you have kind of

There was also a point that the current state of

15

affairs was portrayed as leaving a binary choice of taking a

16

stand or liquidating.

17

additional consideration could be provided in order to

18

achieve full consensus, but the parties have simply chosen

19

to draw the line here and attempt to force a resolution on

20

the objecting states.

However, there is a scenario in which

21

There was another point made about --

Can I stop you -- can interrupt you on

that point?

MR. GOLDMAN:

Let’s assume for the moment that

Connecticut agreed -- let’s assume for the moment that we

2

had a fourth mediation and the Sacklers agreed to contribute

3

another $50 million like they did in the third mediation,

4

the one that Judge Chapman supervised.

5

Washington, Oregon, they all went along with it except one

6

state.

7

the whole thing should still be put aside for that

creditor’s rights?

9

And Connecticut,

Or even just the City of Seattle.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Do you say that

Your Honor, that would be assuming

10

that with that one holdout the Sacklers would refuse to go

11

forward with the contribution?

12

THE COURT:

13

Yeah.

Let’s just say one holdout just

decided that no amount of money was enough.

14

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, that is the difficult question

15

to be answered.

16

And if we believed that truly it was an adequate settlement

I think to be principled about things, we

And that’s the best way I

If I could move to my next point that I wanted to

There was a reference to other claimants in our

And as Your Honor

And if I can now turn to my formal part of my
argument.

10

It was observed by Circuit Judge Henry Friendly in

11

the pre-Code days that conduct of bankruptcy proceedings

12

should not only be right, but seem right.

13

and the view of the other objecting state that the breadth

14

of the releases provided for the Sacklers given what we

15

believe they’ve done leading up to this bankruptcy.

16

not seem right to us, and we would contend is not right.

17

And that belief is based on the recognition that if the plan

18

is confirmed, they will have gotten every bit of protection

19

and more than they would have received in their own

20

bankruptcies and will be able to put a permanent halt to all

21

of these suits, which certainly have exposure.

understand they submitted what they believe to be strong

Can I interrupt you on that?
Yes, Your Honor.
There’s two parts to that.

There’s

the rigorous part and there’s the personal bankruptcy part.

As far as the rigors, we’ll come back to that.

Reasonable minds may differ about the

I think.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, I would -- I do understand.

And I think that I would say that if the amount of

compensation, so to speak, in the sense of cumulative

11

damages reaches an amount that the states can say -- all

12

states can say, you know, this is sufficient punishment, or

with the dichotomy that Your Honor proposed.

role in Purdue and their assets and liabilities.

4

agree with that, right?

5
6

MR. GOLDMAN:

You would

Well, not knowing what was provided

in McKinsey, I’m at a little bit of a disability to respond.

7

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, as far as the discovery

8

taken of the Sacklers in this case, can you imagine that

9

there would be any other discovery taken if they filed

10

bankruptcy as far as their liabilities, their assets, and

11

claims against them?

12

MR. GOLDMAN:

I’m not sure that I know what you’re

13

getting at.

14

whether that should serve as a substitute for what one goes

15

through in the bankruptcy process, I would question.

16

There was extensive discovery.

THE COURT:

You know,

Well, I mean, there are schedules that

you have to fill out.

19

the discovery and the disclosure with regard to assets that

you have a beneficial interest in are even less rigorous in

compelled to file bankruptcy that we’ve already had?

MR. GOLDMAN:

really a complete substitute for having to go through the

You know, obviously there are

10

non-dischargeability concerns and deadlines.

That’s a good response.

are concerned, I do have an uncontroverted affidavit that

says that most of those payments, if they have not been --

if it had not been a partnership structure, would have been

paid by the Debtors directly.

they relieved the Debtors of the tax obligation.

Sacklers are now using the difficulty of collecting any

5

judgements against offshore trusts as one of the reasons why

the shareholder settlement agreement should be approved.

So under these circumstances, we do not believe
the non-consensual releases here seem right or are right --

And that

THE COURT:

But can you wish that away?

Can you

wish those consequences away?

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

The most we can do I think is doing

what we’re doing, Your Honor.

it from happening.

14

THE COURT:

And that is to try to prevent

But, again, I think the avoidable

15

transfer issue really is an estate issue.

16

the Creditors’ Committee and the Debtors and all the other

17

parties have their say.

18

it’s not a third-party release issue, it’s an estate issue.

19

And one could certainly come to the conclusion that as far

20

as the avoidable transfers are concerned, the range of the

21

settlement is within what is reasonable given the risks on

22

the underlying liability and the risks of collection.

23

mean, if you want to go to the Isle of Jersey and seek to

24

avoid the transfers under Jersey law and deal with

enforcement with the Viscount of Jersey, there are obviously

MR. GOLDMAN:

I do acknowledge that.

But I think

5

that what this goes to also, apart from the settlement, is

really to the fairness of the release itself.

7

has to be put in context.

these releases when they are really just giving back a lot

I am on how that really should bear on the permissibility of

the releases themselves, taking that -- in other words, you

14

would really take that into account as to how they got that

15

(indiscernible).

16

THE COURT:

And so that’s really -- I’m

Well, that’s a fair point.

And I have

17

thought carefully and listened carefully and read the

18

evidence carefully to see how much of this $4.325 billion

19

would be attributable to estate claims and how much would be

20

attributable arguably to non-estate claims.

21

really addressed that issue directly.

22

and they’re just arguments, because given that it is a

23

settlement, we didn’t try the merits directly.

24

fair amount of facts and arguments that would lead one to

25

think, I believe, that the value here is not all on account

212-267-6868

And no one has

I do have arguments,

But I have a

of the estate claims necessarily, that you can evaluate this

2

settlement as covering both.

3

to allocate the value to one or the other set of claims

4

because they’re all quite aware of the possibility of a

5

default in the future where they want to litigate as hard as

6

they can.

7

But no one particularly wants

But just the simple point as far as the non-estate

8

claims are concerned that only -- or I actually think less

9

than a handful of Sacklers served on the board.

And I think

10

two or three were officers out of the entire family group.

11

So, you know, people refer to the Sacklers as a unit, but

12

they’re actually -- the testimony shows 16, eight within

13

Side A and eight with Side B, sets of contributors, some of

14

whom I have to assume would have much stronger defenses to

15

these types of claims than others.

16

it’s not an easy calculus.

18

MR. GOLDMAN:

So it’s -- you know,

It is not, Your Honor.

And I do not

--

19

THE COURT:

I agree with you on one point.

Given

20

the size of the claims here, which have not been liquidated,

21

but they are gigantic, one could always and fairly easily

22

say this is not enough, this $4.325 billion isn’t enough.

23

And at one level, that’s clearly the case.

25

least on the personal injury side, that payments on these

On the other hand, we know, at

Page 164
1

types of claims historically are fairly low, unfortunately.

2

You know, the settlement that is in Ms. Conroy’s declaration

3

where she says her firm pretty much had the people with the

4

best claims, who had prescriptions, et cetera, if you assume

5

a reasonable contingency fee, it’s about $13,500 per person

6

under that settlement.

7

But it’s hard to look someone in the eye and say that’s

8

enough.

9

And I realize that was a while ago.

So at one level it would be quite easy for me to

10

say to the Sacklers it’s not enough.

11

it’s hard for me to say to Mr. Price and his committee you

12

have to take the risk that this all falls apart over -- and

13

it’s never going to be enough, so it has to be some other

14

bid or ask, whether it’s another $50 million or another 25

15

or another $100 million.

16

risk.

17

On the other hand,

And at some point, there’s a big

And certainly AGs, who have been very aggressive

18

in pursuing the Sacklers, including the State of New York

19

and the State of Maryland -- I’m sorry, State of

20

Massachusetts, excuse me, reached their point where they

21

weren’t willing to take any more risk of the whole thing

22

falling apart.

23

So I would love for the Sacklers to pay enough to

24

get your clients on board.

25

if we adopt a rule that says any one governmental entity can

saying that they’re not on board with the plan.

MR. GOLDMAN:

So it’s hard for me to see how you

All points well taken.

I think

5

that, you know, it’s a question of line drying as I tried to

6

get Mr. Weinberger to acknowledge he didn’t quite do it.

8

that what happened here, or at least what I perceive to have

happened is there was a certain amount of fatigue that set

10

in.

Some states just threw up their hands and maybe saw the

decisions for ourselves and not to be out voting and told to

MR. GOLDMAN:

Your Honor, I had cited in our

consumer protection claims, claims brought under unfair and

5

deceptive acts and practices acts are non-dischargeable

In my brief in the section of the plan -- or
argument that the plan usurped our rights to have those
declared non-dischargeable.

11

Right.

But that’s for individuals.

And if you’re dealing with a Chapter 11 case, those wouldn’t

be applying except by analogy.

circuit in the MacArthur case dealt with the 523 point.

15

MR. GOLDMAN:

And again, I think the

Well, I was directing it to the

16

Sacklers and the point that the effect of discharge that we

17

viewed they are getting by these releases really

18

circumvented those non-dischargeability provisions, if they

19

had --

20

THE COURT:

I understand.

I understand.

But --

21

well, we’re dealing with a concept that I guess when you’re

22

talking about the payment of money under a plan has not been

23

directly addressed, but it’s certainly been indirectly

24

addressed by the Courts.

25

MR. GOLDMAN:

212-267-6868

Can I flesh out for a moment what I

516-608-2400

Page 167
1

believe the response is to the MacArthur argument?

2

THE COURT:

3

MR. GOLDMAN:

Sure, yeah.
So I’m looking at the case.

And it

4

says MacArthur argues that the injunctive orders constitute

5

a de facto discharge in bankruptcy of non-debtor parties as

6

not entitled to the protection of Chapter 11.

7

But that was directed to MacArthur, a corporation.

8

It didn’t really deal with the issue that I’m raising.

And

9

that is that the effect of discharge here in favor of the

10

Sacklers really does circumvent the non-dischargeability

11

provisions that would apply if they filed their own

12

bankruptcy.

13

Circuit was addressing.

14

That was not a -- the comment that the Second

Except that you’re not getting a

15

discharge under this plan.

17

think went off on that ground, as do a lot of the other

18

cases.

19

They’re settling claims in

And the MacArthur Manville case I

It’s not the same thing as a discharge.
MR. GOLDMAN:

It is not quite the same thing.

20

for the clear majority of their debts and for the clear

21

majority of their current financial problems is solved by

22

this release, we’ll call it, not a discharge.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. GOLDMAN:

25

But

That’s fair.
And so I think it’s as close as the

discharges we’re going to get, even though it’s technically

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 168
1

not an actual discharge.

2

THE COURT:

3

MR. GOLDMAN:

I understand.

Right.
But if I can turn now just to the

4

subject matter jurisdiction argument, which I think is

5

governed by Manville III cited in our papers, which was

6

decided three years after (indiscernible).

7

And in the context of striking down the third

8

party release there, the Second Circuit instructed us to

9

look to a state’s laws to see whether the claims are

10

derivative of the Debtors or whether they are based on some

11

wrongdoing of the third party to independent legal duty.

12

And if we look to state law here, I don’t think

13

there’s any question that the Sacklers engaged, at least as

14

alleged, in independent wrongdoing of their own as opposed

15

to Purdue under state law.

16

The laws of some of the objecting states are

17

directly on point on this.

For example, in Connecticut, an

18

individual can be liable for unfair deceptive acts of a

19

business entity if the individual either participated

20

directly in the entity’s deceptive or unfair acts or had the

21

authority to control them.

22

law.

23

they can be liable under unfair and deceptive practices

24

acts.

25

individual could be liable under their consumer protection

To the same effect is Maryland

As long as there is authority to control the acts,

To the same effect as Vermont law, where an

direct aid to the corporate actor.

Washington’s Consumer Protection Act, where they can be

4

liable for corporate wrongdoing if the individual

5

participates in the wrongful conduct or with knowledge

6

approves of it.

7

And also too with

So all of those are independent legal duties that

8

run to the Sacklers and that would satisfy the Second

9

Circuit’s testare of independent wrongdoing.

10

Now, I know that the Debtors have argued that the

11

indemnity obligations and the insurance policies are part of

12

the calculus here in determining whether there is

13

jurisdiction.

14

test, but maintain it is not so liberal a standard as to

15

preclude consideration of the likelihood or probability that

16

the indemnification claim will be upheld.

17

And I acknowledge the conceivable effects

In the UBS case that the Debtor cited in their

18

brief, the Second Circuit holds that there must be a

19

reasonable legal basis for the claim of indemnity.

20

contend here that that just doesn’t exist.

21

two sources for their obligation to indemnify the Sacklers,

22

the Purdue Pharma bylaws and Purdue Pharma’s latest limited

23

partnership agreement, both of which require the indemnity

24

to act in good faith in order to ultimately be entitled to

25

indemnity.

And we

And they cite

516-608-2400

Page 170
1

But preliminary at least as to the limited

2

partnership agreement, the Debtors overlooked that it’s an

3

executory contract that can be rejected along with the

4

indemnity obligation.

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. GOLDMAN:

Judge -It still creates a claim.
It does.

It would create a

7

contingent claim of indemnity under the contract, no doubt.

8

But it would remove those obligations at least going forward

9

to indemnify.

For example, for a defense clause.

And there

10

are a couple of cases that do hold it executory.

11

Heafitz, 85 B.R. 274 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1988) and the court in

12

Phar-Mor, Inc. v. Strouss Bldg. Associates, 204 B.R. 948

13

(N.D. Ohio 1997) strongly suggested it was executory.

14

In re

But even if it was not rejected, the limited

15

partnership agreement, which is at JX0872, states that the

16

partnership shall not be obligated to indemnify the

17

indemnity to the extent a final decision by a court having

18

jurisdiction in the matter shall establish that the

19

indemnity did not act in good faith.

20

THE COURT:

But again, in SPV OSUS v. UBS, the

21

putative claimant that gave the -- you know, it was third

22

party versus third party, the putative claimant that would

23

argue contribution claims was someone who was being sued

24

independently for having knowledge and participating in

25

Bernie Madoff’s fraud, aiding and abetting BLMIS.

Nevertheless, notwithstanding all of that dirty linen, the

2

Circuit said that there was a basis for related to

jurisdiction.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Acknowledged, but I’m not sure that

5

there was the level of dirty laundry presented to the court

6

there as we have here.

THE COURT:

You know, we have -The fundamental point, which is

Manville II, 517 F.3d 52.

9

MR. GOLDMAN:

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

12

THE COURT:

Yes.
I mean, the case was vacated, right?
Yes, it was.
And if the Circuit -- which, by the

13

way, was dealing with a plan that had already been

14

implemented, so it was actually accurate that these lawsuits

15

at this time against the insurers really didn’t affect the

16

estate, because this was many years after the Manville Trust

17

or the Manville Plan went into effect.

18

But leave that -- leave both of those things

19

aside, that it was vacated and that under those facts, there

20

really was no effect on the estate because the plan was

21

already in place, I think over a decade, and the trust was -

22

- had already been paying out billions of dollars of claims,

23

in part from the insurance settlements.

-- but I think the point is that

Drexel and Metromedia say that under the unusual

circumstance where the injunction is necessary for the plan,

it's an integral part of the plan, it could be granted if

you meet other factors as well, including overwhelming

support for it.

probably have gotten a raw deal, but there was -- it was

MR. GOLDMAN:

It was, indeed, after the fact, but

9

they certainly offset their reliance interest, having paid -

- I know it project -- it was upwards of $100 million, maybe

11

not that much, into the plan.

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. GOLDMAN:

14

THE COURT:

But --

Well, then I guess that was why -I --- they were -- they reversed, is that

15

Judge Lifland had found there was, in fact, jurisdiction,

and no one had challenged that, and therefore, it stood.

MR. GOLDMAN:

It was, I thought, reversed on other

grounds by the Supreme Court.

takes no position on the jurisdictional issue in the

MR. GOLDMAN:

THE COURT:

True.
But they were not the lawyers who were

to pay $500 million more, so you could see why perhaps the

Circuit at that point thought that there something more to

15

squeeze here.

16

MR. GOLDMAN:

It doesn't appear that way.

But I

17

still think for purposes of analysis, it's still good law

for determining whether there is subject matter jurisdiction

course, the Supreme Court case, as far as with the breadth

of jurisdiction over third-party disputes.

5

MR. GOLDMAN:

And certainly,

I would just make the point, Your

6

Honor, then in assessing the indemnity obligation, that you

7

do need to take into account to some degree the probability

8

that indemnity would be upheld.

9

just too much on the record here of findings that would --

10

And I just think there is

will take it against a finding of good faith.

11

THE COURT:

Well, I'm not, you know, again, the

12

record here is in the context of a request to approve a

13

settlement, not a trial on the merits.

14

that, the settlement here is with the entire Sackler family,

15

some of whom, many of who -- I think the majority of whom

16

had no role with these Debtors other than being a

17

shareholder.

18

But having said

others, we heard from three different Board member -- four

23

after 2007.

24

sales, there is still a callable issue as to whether they're

2

liable for all of those claims.

3
4

MR. GOLDMAN:

It didn't come as any surprise to me

that they were proclaiming their innocence, and --

5

THE COURT:

I -- I understand -- I understand.

6

And I -- and one is skeptical, obviously, about this.

7

didn't use the word "pushing" lightly.

8

-- we certainly didn't have any Perry Mason moments, let's

9

put it that way.

10

MR. GOLDMAN:

I

But, you know, it's

Well, acknowledge, Your Honor.

But

11

I would say that the states were under a substantial

12

disability, having been had their actions stayed for the

13

entire duration of the case, and really being forced to try

14

-- not effectively try or -- the claims that were against

15

the Sackler on this expedited track.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. GOLDMAN:

18

THE COURT:

Well, they had -So --- they had approximately 10 million

19

documents with a Creditors' Committee and an Ad Hoc group of

20

Non-Consenting States combing them for any signs of active

21

management.

22

If, for example, I was shown a document about one

23

ride with a salesperson, you would think that if that was

24

unearthed and there were more then the others would be too

25

in those 10-millions of documents.

Page 177

So, I appreciate that, again, this was in the

2

context of a trial of the merits of a settlement instead of

3

the underlying issues and I have no brief for the Sacklers

4

nor do I believe any of the proponents of the Plan.

5

think even if one is to do some analysis of the validity of

6

an indemnification claim, it's hard to see that there

7

wouldn't be some effect, some conceivable effect on an asset

8

of the estate.

9

MR. GOLDMAN:

But I

I'm -- I would just make a point in

10

that regard, Your Honor, that it's hard to believe that

11

after being under investigation from the United States

12

Department of Justice since June of 2016, that the DOJ would

13

come up with a document like Addendum A to the Sackler

14

Settlement Agreement, which is the JX-2096.

15

of detail that is in there implicating the named players,

16

after four years of investigation I think it's hard to

17

believe that they were not well supported and then weren't

18

proceeded by a thorough investigation.

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. GOLDMAN:

21

THE COURT:

With the level

Well, again -I'm saying, it's not --- I heard -- I heard the direct

22

examination on those documents, and I'll push back a little

23

bit in the level of detail.

24

allegations, but a lot is left for the imagination.

25

-- it is obviously very conceivable to me that there is

212-267-6868

There are certainly a number of

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And I'm

516-608-2400

1

substantial potential liability here.

2

on this record, it's hard to see that there's no conceivable

3

effect on the estate based on that potential.

4

MR. GOLDMAN:

I'm just -- I just,

Well, I'll also add the point that -

5

- and this references the guilty plea in 2020, which covers

6

the conduct from -- Purdue's conduct from May 2007 to March

7

2017.

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. GOLDMAN:

Right.
Some rather serious allegations

10

there about ceasing detailing prescribers that they knew

11

were not prescribing correctly, and for medically and

12

necessary reasons, and the kickbacks in the Practice Fusion.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. GOLDMAN:

15

THE COURT:

I agree.
Right.
Although, I also note that there was -

16

- although there were four Sacklers examined, I don't think

17

any of them was asked about Practice Fusion.

18

who said, I didn't -- I never heard of Practice Fusion.

19

look, I think -- I think we've probably said enough on this

20

one.

21

I want to be clear.

Maybe one was,
So,

I think there is substantial

22

risk that the Sacklers, or some of them, would be liable for

23

huge amounts of money, no question, both to the Debtors and

24

to third parties.

25

given the risks on the other side of not just the merits,

I --

10

MR. GOLDMAN:

I just want to make a quick few

11

points about the Kirwan decision.

12

what's notable about Manville III is that it did not hold as

13

did Kirwan.

14

release position as part of a confirmed plan.

15

Bankruptcy Court therefore had core jurisdiction.

16

And, you know, I --

That's simply because it challenged third-party
The

I think they were asserting related to

17

jurisdiction there, and if the fact that that particular

18

release was in the plan, you would think that if the

19

reasoning in Kirwan, is thought to be correct, they would

20

have just said, well, its core was in the plan.

21

what Manville III held.

22

THE COURT:

That's not

But no one argued that because it --

23

they weren't -- they weren't at confirmation.

24

after the fact.

25

fighting each other and a bunch of plaintiffs' lawyers.

516-608-2400

Page 180
1

2

MR. GOLDMAN:

But even so, after the fact, they

3

certainly could have argued there was core jurisdiction

4

because it was part of the Plan.

5

THE COURT:

They didn't need to.

They just needed

6

-- well, the whole thing was academic because they -- they

7

missed, because no one briefed it to them perhaps, that the

8

key point, which the Supreme Court picked up on, which is

9

the jurisdictional argument had decided 10 years before, or

10

20 years before by Judge Lifland's order.

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, I would just make the point

12

that the determination of whether something is core, really

13

should depend on whether it happens to be inserted in the

14

plan.

15

Kirwan decision's response to that is that it has to be

16

sufficiently related to the issues before the court, that's

17

what the response was to that --

It's just too convenient.

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. GOLDMAN:

And I understand that the

Right.
-- argument.

But if that's the

20

case, every third-party release of an officer or director

21

could be found could be -- could be related to the issues --

22

THE COURT:

Well, not necessarily.

I mean, those

23

types of release may well be abused, no doubt.

24

know, the Third Circuit dealt with this from Judge

25

Silverstein up to the other circuit in Millennium, same

212-267-6868

3

MR. GOLDMAN:

I understand and I still don't

disagree -- still don't agree with the decision --

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. GOLDMAN:

Okay.
-- as it's, you know, simply form

6

over substance really when they say, if it's put in a plan,

7

it must be poor, and the third-party releases really don't

8

address the merits of the claims, but effectively cancel

9

THE COURT:

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

12

THE COURT:

Except that -And whether the claims --- again, the Third Circuit standard

13

includes fairness and whether you agree with Judge Garrity's

14

interpretation of 1129(a)(7) as applied here in Dietech or

15

not, that is at least a fairness element, a fairness

16

analysis.

17

And again, you know, there is a difference if it's

18

in a plan.

19

you see whether it's, you know, just barely accepted or

20

overwhelmingly accepted, you have it in the context of a

21

confirmation hearing with, in this case, six days of

22

evidence being presented and, you know, approximately --

23

well, a little under 40 witnesses.

24

-- there is -- I think there is a difference by doing it

25

through a plan, including the jurisdictional hook, which is

212-267-6868

You have the voting.

You see how people voted,

2

This is not just a property of the estate issue.

3

You have -- you have Congress providing for -- the

4

proponents would argue, extraordinarily powerful tools in

5

the confirmation context in Sections 1123 and 1141, that 105

6

would be in assistance of.

7

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, the final point I'll make on

8

this, Your Honor, and I understand you may have a different

9

view on this.

But, I mean, whether the claims are cancelled

10

as part of a plan or are adjudicated on the merits, the

11

result is the same from the perspective of the party who is

12

being forced to give up the release.

13

gone, they can't prosecute them anymore, and their claims,

14

although they might be channeled into a trust, are severely

15

limited by what it is put into that pot.

16

their claim is extinguished.

17

They're claims are

And the balance of

So, to me it is form over substance to join up a

18

dichotomy, but I understand the Third Circuit and Judge

19

McMahon see it differently.

20

THE COURT:

Okay.

And frankly, I think the

21

Circuit Courts generally see it differently.

22

at least in the Blixseth case, the Ninth Circuit has said

23

that some types of third-party claims could be eliminated

24

under a Plan.

25

seemed to say that perhaps in the mass tort context you

212-267-6868

At this point,

In Pacific Lumber, Judge Jones actually

516-608-2400

Page 183

could do that, but not in this sort of general release of

2

the Os and Ds.

3

So, I think at this point, the only Circuit on

4

record, as opposed to several, like, the Seventh, Second,

5

Third, First, Sixth, Eighth, support third-party releases,

6

is the Tenth Circuit.

8
9

But they haven't had a case since

So, I -- look, this is the -- the cases, the
courts, the Circuit Courts, that say that these types of

10

releases are proper, and therefore, I think, supported

11

jurisdictionally, do so requiring the bankruptcy court to

12

take a very exacting hard look at all the facts and

13

circumstances.

14

where you take a look, and a good look if someone's

15

objecting, but not that type of level of inquiry.

16

That's different than the normal settlement

But they do say that if it's within those

17

parameters, which of course, appellate courts are free to

18

say, well, no, it really didn't fit within those parameters,

19

but if it does fit within those parameters, that this is

20

authorized.

21

MR. GOLDMAN:

With that, Your Honor, I'll just

22

make one final point in which I haven't addressed yet.

23

that -- and that deals with what I view as preemption, and

24

relating to Section 1123, which states, notwithstanding any

25

--

THE COURT:

2

MR. GOLDMAN:

Right.
-- estate are, but the plan can

3

provide adequate means for its implementation, which the

4

Debtors would argue would include a third-party release.

5

But I think that what that does, is it effectively is

6

preempting the police power claims of the states that we're

7

arguing here for by, you know, effectively eliminating them.

8

And there is case law that I cited in our

9

objection, the PG&E case in the Ninth Circuit and -- as well

10

as the Urban Tanner decision in the First Circuit, that hold

11

basically that the -- a plan has no right to preempt these

12

type of police power claims.

13

THE COURT:

No.

Except in those cases, what the

14

plan was doing was not channeling a monetary claim to a

15

fund.

16

regulatory oversight of the debtor as far as the UC approval

17

of fundamental corporate changes.

19

case, I think is pretty impeccable in its analysis of 1123

20

and what can be done under it and what can't be done under.

21

And, of course, that didn't involve something exactly like

22

this either.

What the plan in PG&E was doing was changing the

23

They're really a couple

I mean, the Third Circuit's federal Mogul

But clearly, the statute means something, and it's

24

hard to see the logic of applying PG&E to channeling money.

25

In fact, PG&E itself said, 1123 applies to only financial

3

state; that's money.

4

Well, I think nothing's really more financial than

MR. GOLDMAN:

I had viewed that -- and I know what

5

Your Honor's referring to, the holding that it -- I had

6

viewed that to be directly to the notwithstanding state law,

7

applicable state law.

8

the state law they were talking about, being notwithstanding

9

to, was financial related.

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. GOLDMAN:

12

THE COURT:

I had viewed the court to meant that

Well -So -- but that's the way I took --- to me, I mean, you don't -- you

don't need -- you know, that's too narrow a description

14

because then, you know, Ohio v. Kovacs doesn't matter.

15

Right?

16

fact that it's a discharge anyway.

17

claims for money are discharged in corporate bankruptcies.

18

So, I -- it has to -- it has to be broader than just getting

rid of a claim.

But it clear that the wiser course of action is to keep the

The parties need to focus on their joint goal of getting

help to victims, but without the mistaken premise that

sovereign states can be compelled to grant releases of

7

Now, Your Honor, I'm going to give you a brief

road map into what our argument is going to be about.

The focus of our argument today is that the

18

improper under Metromedia.

the nature of what is being enjoined, states exercising

20

police powers, which I will address briefly -- shortly, and

21

the beneficiaries of the injunction, the Sackler family, the

legal standards we think are relatively -- should be

uncontroverted here.

25

The impropriety is based both on

of facts and circumstances, as the Debtors themselves

exactly what our evidence does.

It's not clear to me exactly why anyone had

First of all, as Your Honor pointed out, the

15

standards under Rule 9019 and the standards for non-

17

That holding is being mocked by the reported use here.

The Debtors are trying to read into the

I will also note that the decision surveyed

9

earlier decisions dealing with the topic and that is why,

10

because no earlier decisions dealt with the circumstances

11

here, that there's nothing in Metromedia that deals with our

12

particular circumstances.

13

The Debtors have made the astonishing argument

14

that the central holding in Metromedia is that releases are

15

appropriate as long as they are important to the Debtor's

restructuring.

are important to the Debtor's restructure.

Debtors also argue that payments to be made by the

As a result, the Sacklers are facing exposure to

In short, there are a lot of cases --

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. GOLD:

9

THE COURT:

Can we explore that?
Certainly, Your Honor.
That sounds like you're accepting that

10

they would be liable for the trillions of dollars and that

11

more than, or materially more than the settlement sum would

12

be collected.

13
14

What is your basis for saying that?

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, I am not accepting that.

I

carefully used the word "exposure" --

15

THE COURT:

16

MR. GOLD:

Okay.
-- because there is the potential for

17

that.

We have not asked this Court -- I think all the

18

parties have agreed that it is not for this Court to

19

actually make findings regarding the exact merits of such

20

actions and --

21

THE COURT:

But I'm supposed to consider the risks

22

and the rewards of both alternatives: the alternative of the

23

plan versus the alternative where I deny confirmation of the

24

plan.

25

MR. GOLD:

212-267-6868

Well, Your Honor, your -- I think that

Veritext Legal Solutions

is taken into account in our argument.

2

what you're asking me here.

3

THE COURT:

I'm not sure exactly

I think, again, if you're going to get

4

to that, fine.

5

because they face substantial exposure, they're not paying

6

enough.

7

But I just don't accept the premise that

MR. GOLD:

Well, no, that's not the argument that

8

I'm making, Your Honor.

9

that it's a very good deal from their perspective.

10

I'm simply marking the argument
And that

the --

11

THE COURT:

12

enough means it's a good deal.

13

MR. GOLD:

That's the same point.

Not paying

It's the same point.

That could be.

I'm simply comparing

14

the relative sizes of the two, Your Honor.

15

have certainly not shown any case where a payment that was

16

so trifling in connection with the claims in the case was

17

deemed substantial.

18

Debtors also argue that we are --

19

THE COURT:

But the Debtors

But, again, trifling -- you can define

20

trifling in a couple of different ways, but ultimately, it

21

would seem to me that trifling means, if it really is

22

trifling, that it is not sufficient in terms of the actual

23

legal risk faced by both sides.

24
25

MR. GOLD:

Well, first, Your Honor, we do not

believe that it is for this Court to make an evaluation of

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 193
1

the risks faced by the sovereign states in determining

2

whether or not to accept a settlement or to prosecute claims

3

against the Sacklers.

4

THE COURT:

But you were just telling me under

5

Metromedia this is insufficient.

6

determine sufficiency unless I do that?

7

MR. GOLD:

8

THE COURT:

9

it is sufficient.

So how am I supposed to

What I am saying -There are 38 sovereign states that say

determination as to whether they're right or you're right if

11

I'm going to be applying the Metromedia factors.

12

understood Mr. Goldman that I shouldn't even get there.

13

got that point.

14

one of them is a materially sufficient contribution.

15

don't I have to inquire as to whether it's sufficient or not

16

and just the fact that a state says it isn't shouldn't, end

17

the day there if I'm applying the Metromedia Factors?

18

logically, because 38 states and thousands of governmental

19

entities say it is sufficient.

20
21

I
I

But now we're at applying the factors and
So

And

MR. GOLD: Your Honor, I think we're talking about
two different things here.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. GOLD:

Okay.
The fact that -- we do not dispute that

24

reasonable minds can differ about whether or not the deal

25

that is proposed by the Debtors can be accepted or not be

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 194
1

accepted and the fact that 38 states have decided that they

2

wish to take this deal does not, in our view, mean that the

3

Court can determine that they are being more reasonable than

4

states that are not and therefore, their view should be

5

imposed on them.

6

However, with respect to the substantiality prong,

7

if you will, under Metromedia, we think that that can be

8

measured in a couple different ways.

9

right here was the matter which I think is fairly undisputed

What I was addressing

10

before the Court of comparing the amount of money that is

11

being paid with the amounts of claims in the case.

12

amount of money that's being paid here is a tenth of a cent

13

on payments to Unsecured Creditors in this case.

14

am simply saying is that none of the cases involving an

15

application of the substantiality decision under Metromedia

16

or otherwise have found that a payment was substantial when

17

it was such a tiny percentage of the amounts of claims in

18

the case.

19

THE COURT:

The

And what I

Do you have any cases that talk about

20

a percentage?

21

and in other cases that talk about paying all or

22

substantially all of the claims.

23

language, but I'm also aware of decisions that support a

24

payment and injunction where there is a substantial payment

25

or contribution of consideration.

212-267-6868

I know that there is language in Metromedia

I'm aware of that

So I'm not aware of --

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 195

other than that language that I alluded to -- there being

2

any analysis of a percentage versus the claims.

3

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, I agree with what you have

4

stated.

5

payment of claims, which is certainly not the case there.

6

And other cases, although they did not expressly go through

7

that analysis, we tried to look at what was happening in

8

those cases and we have not found a single case where there

9

was such a disparity between the return to Creditors and the

10

amounts being paid.

11
12

Some cases, yes, have talked about substantial

THE COURT:

Nor I expect have you found an amount

as large as 4.325 billion dollars either.

13

MR. GOLD:

But also not any case where the number

14

of claims were in the trillions, Your Honor.

15

those two are inextricably linked.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. GOLD:

18

We believe

Well, not necessarily.
Okay.

Well, that is at least our

argument, Your Honor.

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. GOLD:

Okay.
The Debtors argue that we are inventing

21

a police powers exception to non-consensual third-party

22

release juris prudence.

23

It is not entirely a blank slate.

First of all, we are not arguing for an exception

24

to Metromedia or carve out from Metromedia.

25

suggesting that Metromedia properly applied would result in

Veritext Legal Solutions

We are

516-608-2400

Page 196
1

no third-party releases being imposed on sovereign states,

2

not that it's an exception to the case.

3

But we also note that there are strong hints, if

4

you will, from related context regarding the importance of

5

claims asserted by governmental entities.

6

THE COURT:

Can I -- I think I'm going to do this

7

and I apologize, but your colleague, Mr. Goldman, really did

8

cover it.

We spent a good 45 minutes on this police power

9

argument.

You've also briefed it.

10

I just don't know if it

really makes sense to spend more time on it.

THE COURT:

They actually did acknowledge the

MR. GOLD:

I agree with Your Honor and clearly, we

are not dealing here with previous injunctions of the sort

15

should not be faulted for not crafting an exception to a

What I'm talking about here is the situation where

full release from the consequences of that action or maybe

10

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, I am not telling you either

of those.

I am just telling you that the Attorney General

making public certain documents and not other documents in a

servants who, while trying to obtain justice and payments

for their states, are mindful of trying to avoid chaotic

situations and are very capable of negotiating with each

other to keep things from devolving into chaos.

20

We submit that if this case does not proceed from

21

the mistaken premise that non-consensual third party

22

releases could be imposed on the states that it is likely

23

that responsible heads would come up with a solution that

24

protected the public interest and achieved some kind of

justice.

Exactly what that would be would have to be

2

But the experience in these other cases suggests

3

that the dismissive comments posed to Washington to say that

4

you just want chaos, you just want to sue, you want

5

everything to go away is far from the truth in that while

6

what happens in one case doesn't necessarily prove what's

7

happening in another case, it certainly gives strong reason

8

to believe that cooler heads will prevail and that the

9

parties, once they understand what the bounds of their

10

jurisdiction and what they can get are, can reach a

11

resolution.

12

Very compelling evidence was presented in the case

by the Sacklers about how much they want the resolution,

about how important it is that they have a resolution, that

they need and want global finality.

what they can achieve, that they will be able to reach a

5

understood that the reach of this Court did not encompass

Reasonable minds can disagree as to what is the best result,

analogy that when someone refers to the tragedy of the

5

commons, that refers to some common asset that is being used

6

by some parties to the detriment of others.

7

perhaps, that some are polluting in so that others cannot

8

use.

9

in this context what is meant by the commons.

I am simply trying to understand the

A lake,

I understand the basic concept, and I'm asking myself

10

What is the commons here that is -- that we are

11

being accused of spoiling for the benefit of others?

12

am suggesting here is that the commons in this context

13

cannot mean the debtors or their estates because we are

14

really not contesting what is happening with the property of

15

the Debtors' estates --

THE COURT:

MR. GOLD:

THE COURT:

-- and what is being done there.
But the record is crystal clear that

19

the current plan at least, and the work that the parties

20

spent for over a year in allocating the value of the

21

Debtors' estates wouldn't survive the collapse of the

settlement with the Sacklers.

argument.

THE COURT:

4

MR. GOLD:

This was the Debtors'

My only point is that the commons here,

5

if I'm understanding the Debtors' analogy, is the money that

the Sacklers are contributing or the assets of the Sacklers

THE COURT:

I guess -- I think they

11

would disagree with you, which is that the commons is the

entire set of agreements that the parties have agreed to,

13

not just the Sackler piece of it.

14

MR. GOLD:

15

THE COURT:

Well, that -And I do understand your point, but

16

we're just coming back to the same point every time, which

17

is that you believe every state needs to agree to this, and

to --

lot of on-point, directly on-point, precedent on that issue.

I'm now ready to move onto new points.

7

8

that we submitted a fair amount of evidence, and the amount

9

of evidence we introduced is very much part of the point.

10

I just note

Our argument, as I said before, is that the

11

conduct of the Sacklers weighs tremendously upon whether or

12

not the leases are proper under Metro Media and under

13

general federal law.

14

Sacklers' conduct renders them undeserving of the benefits,

it is significant that we are not talking about isolated

pieces of evidence.

better suited to answer that particular question than I.

is the balance between being what you just described Miss

Thank you, Your Honor.

In conclusion,

3

I just wish to respond to the question that has been asked

4

by plan proponents:

settlement?

6

Why are estates opposing this

I will simply say that we have not questioned the

7

good faith that states and other parties who've accepted the

8

settlement.

9

recognize it's a difficult decision that involves weighing

I think we've established, Your Honor, that we

10

apples and oranges, and we ask that the decision of the

11

objecting states be respected as well.

12

With respect to respect and good faith, I will not

13

respond specifically to the cruel comments that Mr. Price

14

made regarding the Attorneys' General of several states.

15

will simply say that just speaking for Washington in this

16

regard, we suggest that you look at what Washington has done

17

rather than what anyone might insinuate.

And for instance, the funds that McKinsey -- that

19

Washington received in the McKinsey settlement have gone to

abatement, and that was done by Washington without the need

21

of having the Bankruptcy Court or anyone else direct

22

Washington that that's what they had to do.

Yes, and I can see you and hear you

MR. EDMUNDS:

All right.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Brian Edmunds for the State of Maryland.

6

Let me first of all say that I will adopt for our

7

state the arguments that Mr. Goldman and Mr. Gold have made

8

on behalf of the other states.

9

there are specific points that were assigned to me today.

And I'm going to kind of -I

10

think the Court has gotten into them to some extent in its

11

questions, so I'm just going to try to, at this point,

12

address the questions that I think may be left over that the

13

Court has at this stage of a lengthy argument.

14

I mean, I think the first one that is important

15

and what I was going to talk about anyway, is what it is

16

that we are seeking here to do.

17

It's not.

18

power that we have, and specifically about achieving

19

deterrence and regulating the opioid market.

Is it just about money?

What this is is about implementing the police

20

Money is certainly important, receiving money in

21

the form of compensation, disgorgement, penalties that are

22

authorized under not only the Maryland statutes, but all of

23

the state's statutes that I'm aware of, is important.

24

it's important not just for the purpose of compensation.

25

It's important for the purpose of deterrence, for the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

But

516-608-2400

Page 230
1

purpose of the regulation that it provides to the conduct of

2

businesses in the marketplace, especially in a marketplace

3

as important as the prescription drug marketplace.

4

To that end, the statutes that we proceed under,

5

Maryland's is mentioned in our separate objection, but they

6

give -- ours is called a cease and desist proceeding, and we

7

are authorized in that context incidentally to recover

8

compensatory damages.

9

But the proceeding generally operates for an

10

injunction, which we would I think, you know, certainly, we

11

would seek an expansive one against both Debtors and the

12

Sacklers in the proceeding in Maryland, and it also permits

13

the recovery of disgorgement, of damages as I said, and of

14

civil penalties among other things that the statute provides

15

for.

16

And when I look at this, when we look at this,

17

right, my full-time job is to assist our attorney general in

18

carrying out the police powers that are assigned to him by

19

our Constitution and statutes.

20

he looks at is whether this actually will bring about a

21

change in conduct, and from that standpoint, it's not

22

enough.

23

What I look at here and what

And that, I think, is also the reason why to have

24

our claims sort of brought in the same context -- and

25

everything I heard this morning, you know, relegates us to

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 231
1

the status, I think, of a co-creditor, of a private creditor

2

is the problem that we're dealing with, right.

3

We have a set of responsibilities that is greater

4

than the responsibilities of counsel who appear here for

5

private creditors.

6

public that yet elects our attorney general that instituted

7

our government, for which the protection of which is what we

8

are paid for, to see to it that conduct is changed, and we

9

don't think that this settlement does that.

10

We have a set of responsibilities to the

I think that when you look at it from the ex-ante

11

perspective of somebody who operates within the marketplace,

12

what you see from this is that the Sacklers were able to get

13

away with a majority of the money that they took, both from

14

Purdue and from consumers.

15

full airing of the conduct and the full adjudication of the

16

conduct is what, more than anything else, we seek.

17
18

And that, I think, as well as a

I mean, money is certainly important, Your Honor.
It is.

19

THE COURT:

Can we just stop on that point?

So I

20

have no doubt, Mr. Edmunds, that you're a dedicated public

21

official.

22

of the claims against the Sacklers; is that what you're

23

saying?

24
25

So you're saying that you need a full litigation

MR. EDMUNDS:

I am saying that that is one thing

that we would seek and that is one thing that I think would

2

something we would pursue --

Well, if you're going to seek money --

MR. EDMUNDS:

5

THE COURT:

-- and that in any form other than --

6

if you're seeking money in the form of a settlement, I think

you'd have to agree with me that you wouldn't have a full

what I've said.

State of Maryland.

THE COURT:

But those actions relate to what

they have done in the marketing and sale of OxyContin and

practices in the marketing and sale of dangerous drugs, and

So let me be clear.

When you're

talking about a cease and desist proceeding, you're not

talking about having the Sacklers ceasing and desisting,

Because under this agreement, consistent with their

actions for the last two years, they have ceased and

3

desisted, right?

4

MR. EDMUNDS:

5

THE COURT:

6

I'm not sure that that's true.
You're talking about someone else

ceasing and desisting, not the Sacklers, right?

7

MR. EDMUNDS:

I think that this -- no, I'm talking

8

about direct claims against the Sacklers, Your Honor, and I

9

think it's --

10

THE COURT:

Well, you referred to a cease and

11

desist proceeding, which means stopping something from

12

happening.

13

24

I'm not disputing that you wouldn't have a

4

Sackler family that is at issue here.

5

There is a website that is out there now that

So, I mean, I don't -- you know, stopping -- they

6

have stopped some of the conduct perhaps.

But I still think

7

in a cease and desist order proceeding and a proceeding we

8

would bring under our Consumer Protection Act, we still have

9

the ability to seek a cease and desist order and an

10

injunction that keeps them from restarting the conduct, for

11

example.

12
13

THE COURT:

And isn't this -- doesn't the plan do

that very thing with an injunction?

14

MR. EDMUNDS:

I think that the injunction in the

15

plan would be perhaps broader and have more in it if we were

16

to do it separately.

17

THE COURT:

18

Have you made any suggestions to that

effect on how to make it broader?

19

MR. EDMUNDS:

I have not personally, but I believe

that members of the NCSG have, and I would have to leave it

21

to them to explain because it's been a while since I looked

at it.

the works.

24

that's a part that I have not looked at specifically for

25

purposes of what I would say to Your Honor today.

THE COURT:

2

MR. EDMUNDS:

Okay.
But I do think that there is that

3

issue, right?

4

conduct that relates to opioids.

5

at the state level against the Sacklers, I think we would be

6

looking at more broadly prohibiting them from engaging in

7

future violations in the pharmaceutical space and perhaps

8

just future violations in the sale and marketing of products

9

in the state in general, which I believe that this

10

I mean, we are concerned -- and not just
If we sought an injunction

injunction does not do.

11

So I think that that is the issue here, right?

12

The money is important, but to put it in perspective, Your

13

Honor, I mean, we spend -- the last figure I saw was

14

something close to a billion dollars a year on the opioid

15

crisis.

16

maybe a month, right, by money that we are already spending.

And so, our share of this gets paid out in weeks,

17

And I would note, Mr. Huebner I think erroneously

18

cited the Maryland statute as the example of what states

19

would do with the money were it not for the plan.

20

Mr. Huebner overlooked our 2019 statute that dedicates all

21

money we receive by virtue or settlement or by judgments

22

against opioid industry participants to opioid abatement

23

period.

24
25

In fact,

There's no need for that language in Maryland's
case.

There's no need for the plan to commit it to

2

states, I can't -- I don't have a 50 state survey prepared,

3

but I do know that a lot of others have statutes and the

4

ones that do not have agreed.

5

And so, if that was his example for all of the

THE COURT:

Although the statutes, in some

6

instances, have subsequently been amended as far as other

7

types of settlements, right, and they can be amended.

8
9

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, they can be amended.

But, I mean, I think that they are as committed as they can

10

get when there is a statute that dedicates opioid -- you

11

know, when the legislature enacts, and the governor signs a

12

statute that provides the money from opioid crisis related

13

litigation goes for relief of the opioid crisis and cannot

14

be replaced, I think that that's, you know, maybe the gold

15

standard.

16

But I know that other states, like Washington as

17

Mr. Robinson O'Neill just mentioned, have done it in other

18

ways, not by statute.

19

think the states have worked hard on recovering for

20

themselves and for their citizens that are being spent on

21

abatement without the need to impose a bankruptcy plan of

22

reorganization that, you know, mandates that they do that.

23

But there is a lot of money that I

So I think that -- but I think that, you know,

24

money is important certainly, but the bottom line is that

25

this is conduct that will keep going on and in our judgment

as we look and make decisions about what is necessary to

protect our citizens and what is necessary to kind of avert

each day, almost seven in Maryland dead each day.

Whose conduct are you referring to?

MR. EDMUNDS:

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. EDMUNDS:

The Sacklers here, Your Honor.
All right.
I mean, the particular -- I know

12

that there has been some question as to how broad that

13

category of the Sacklers is and how far into the family it

14

reaches.

15

as directors, their conduct needs to be addressed and they

16

need to --

17

But I would say for at least the ones who served

THE COURT:

Well, listen.

I think if that is your

18

state's issue, that can certainly be address very easily I

19

believe by the Sacklers, consistent with all that has been

20

represented to me during this trial as to their lack of a

21

role going forward.

22

that's fine.

23

So I don't -- I really -- you know, but

MR. EDMUNDS:

But I suppose, Your Honor, it's the

Sacklers plus, right?

4

would use for it, is important too.

5

I think that the deterrent effect, the general

We are worried about the conduct that the Sacklers

6

engaged in here, but we are also worried that it will be

repeated by others.

9

much more and when your conduct has caused so much harm, I

And I think that the idea the amount,

10

think that the amount is insufficient to effectuate that

11

kind of deterrence.

12

It doesn't -- it's our tool to kind of stop bad

13

conduct that we're exercising here.

14

power is, and I think that we don't succeed in doing that

15

from this settlement.

16

That's what the police

Well, do you succeed if the result is

17

years of litigation and, in all likelihood, a lower

18

recovery?

I don't -- I just don't agree with

that.

22

of that.

have introduced what I was saying by saying that.

24
25

I'm just posing you a hypothetical, and I should

hypothesize the outcome that wouldn't be as good but might

be what happened and compare it and you see what the

3

comparison is.

4

know, we can't know and it's our decision to make, right?

5

But I think that the issue is that, you

THE COURT:

Well, I guess that comes back.

You

6

can actually make a fairly well-informed decision on that

point, and that's why we have a six-day trial with, you

witnesses.

23

I believe it's the standard in all

It derives from a case in I think the Seventh

And the standard it sets is that, one, is

obviously direct participation, and I think that there is

Richard Sackler's concession that he engaged in things like

2

the McKinsey marketing, the McKinsey marketing plan, and you

3

know, had by himself a call with McKinsey's -- with the

4

McKinsey employees that were proposing these things, and

5

that the board then subsequently implemented their

6

recommendations and that the board also discussed them, and

7

it certainly didn't change them.

8
9

So I think that -- so the Amy Travel standard is
direct participation, and then there's another prong and it

10

is the right to control the conduct and knowledge or

11

constructive knowledge of what the conduct is.

12

the board members who testified before Your Honor said that

13

they read the board materials, which are in evidence and

14

are, you know, among -- I think there's more, but there are

15

documents that have been presented to the Court.

16

And each of

And each of them made clear that the board

17

discussed and engaged in, you know, the review of proposals

on marketing and sales put forward by management.

19

-- two of the board members who testified have a

20

disagreement as to what their purposes were in doing that,

21

22

had the right to control the conduct and were, on some

23

level, aware of what the conduct was.

participation in sales and marketing that is sufficient to

establish liability under Maryland, and I think, under other

states' law.

So I think that the evidence, just the limited

18

evidence before the Court, which was presented not for the

purposes of establishing these claims, demonstrates that we

have what we need if we were to go forward.

21

Richard Sackler's testimony goes pretty far to establishing

his liability and the liability of others.

mentioned before, which is the need to change conduct, the

That's why --- (indiscernible) the conduct.
-- you were cross-examining him on

Okay, fine.

9

MR. EDMUNDS:

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. EDMUNDS:

That is why I was.
All right.
I mean, the issue there is that they

12

had to guilty pleas, 2007 and 2020, and that they continued

13

after 2007, and to some extent, the conduct in 2018 was

14

repeated with respect to other foreign entities.

15

that was the purpose.

16

to show the documents that the DOJ may have had in its

17

possession when it came up with those allegations and

18

incorporated them into what it did.

19
20

THE COURT:

MR. EDMUNDS:

22

THE COURT:

Are you representing to me that you

I have some of them.

Certainly.

And they were offered to be introduced

ever in this case?

24
25

And so we did not dig underneath that

have those documents?

21

23

I mean,

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, we understood that the

underlying merits of the states' claims were not at issue,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 246

and so limited ourselves to a short cross, short direct,

2

rather, of each of these witnesses.

3

one point I had sent, I think Mr. Joseph said, 6,200 pages

4

for use.

5

documents.

6

And we didn’t do that.

I mean, you know, at

But we had those

The Court received them.
So, I mean, that was the...

You know, we had had

7

before the bankruptcy a much longer trial planned than the

8

State of Maryland.

9

that, I think, would have been necessary to fully present

10

It was on the schedule, I believe.

And

the claims.

11

But in any case, the point is that it's the

12

conduct, right?

And to the extent the states are being

13

treated as if they were -- you know, needed to make

14

decisions in the same way that private creditors do here,

15

which I'm not faulting, that's just not our consideration.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. EDMUNDS:

18

THE COURT:

Okay, well -We have more.
I've heard them from all three

19

lawyers, and I don't need to hear it again, because you guys

20

have made that point and that's fine.

21

MR. EDMUNDS:

Okay.

Your Honor, let me just -- I

22

wanted to talk -- I have one more point, and that is about

23

the third-party -- and I think that maybe this is going to

24

be addressed more in what the parties to over the next night

25

and into Wednesday on the third-party releases, to the

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 247
1

extent they apply to third parties other than the Sacklers.

2

Right?

3

And the issue is just that that -- when Mr.

4

Huebner presented this morning, he referenced some other

5

settlements.

6

this case is broader than any of those that he mentioned.

7

The consultants, advisory board representatives, contract

8

sales representatives of Purdue Pharma, whose conduct is

9

released related to at least Purdue's opioids.

I think that the list of released parties in

10

And I think that that is a broad area, that if

11

changes aren't made we need to talk about, because those

12

releases are so broad as to even further prevent us from

13

changing the conduct here.

14

Purdue and what Purdue did gets out of it.

15

have not contributed a thing to the plan.

16

hope that we are still -- I have received confirmation, but

17

I hope that we are still discussing those issues and can

18

present something different to the Court for its

19

consideration jointly with other parties on Wednesday.

20

Everybody who participated with
Some of them
And, you know, I

And I guess I'll stop at that for now.

I don't

21

think it makes sense to go farther until we know the answer

22

to that.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. EDMUNDS:

25

Okay.
But that is a concern.

And so with

that, yeah, I think that that -- those are the points that I

MR. FOGELMAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

My name is

Larry Fogelman, and I represent the United States of America

3

in these proceedings.

4

three key issues: due process, Metromedia, and subject

5

6

I would like to make a few points on

Your Honor, it would violate the due process

7

clause of the Constitution if this Court strips the rights

8

of sovereign states as to the Sacklers and the rights of

9

individual victims of the opioid crisis due to the Sacklers.

10

The states and individuals must be provided with reasonable

11

notice and an opportunity to be heard before their property

12

interests are taken away.

13

And let's make no mistake.

This third-party

14

release takes away property rights of states and individuals

15

in their causes of actions against the Sacklers.

The

16

release is effectively a judgment on the merits.

It has res

Now, let's talk about notice, Your Honor.

The

2

that there would be a confirmation hearing with disclosure

5

Sacklers are not even debtors, is not a substitute for

7

Rather, it was noticed

But this short

A notice of an impending confirmation hearing does

8

not confer personal jurisdiction over states and individual

9

victims, and their claims against the Sacklers, and it is

10

not sufficient to give the Court power over those claims.

11

Rather, formal service of process is required.

12
13

As Mr. Huebner said this morning regarding the
Sacklers, to sue the Sacklers, you have to sue --

the Metromedia and subject matter jurisdiction points?

And that's --

to hear more on this, Mr. Fogelman.

11
12

Okay.

THE COURT:

Briefly, because it's been covered

already, and again, it's covered in your brief.

15

MR. FOGELMAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

With regard

16

to Metromedia, I'll just make a few quick points.

17

with regard to one of the factors described by the Second

18

Circuit that enjoined claims were channeled to the

19

settlement fund, rather than extinguished.

20

First,

Well, the only settlement fund that's set up here

21

is for the opioid claims relating to Purdue's conduct.

22

the release that's at issue covers a far broader, almost

23

incomprehensible, number of topics for which there is no

24

settlement fund that's set up.

25

the language in the release is, anything based on or

212-267-6868

But

It would cover -- I mean,

relating to or in any manner arising from in whole or in

the petition date, including the Debtors' opioid-related

4

activities, manufacture, marketing and sale of products,

interactions with regulators concerning opioid-related

activities or products, and involvement in the subject

And in fact, some of the testimony by,

21

I believe, the Sacklers who are closest to the issues, have

22

focused on a release related to Purdue's opioid-related

23

activities.

24

then they said, well, we're going to rely on our lawyers.

25

And I think I made it very clear that the lawyers run a real

Although

2

will have the effect of not being approved, as opposed --

3

instead, proposing one that's consistent with the

4

consideration is being paid for.

5

MR. FOGELMAN:

I appreciate that, Your Honor.

And

6

in fact, that language is so broad, as to reach things like

7

workplace safety claims, if they existed, employment packs

8

issues, environmental law, civil fraud, beyond opioids,

9

contracting fraud, state ADA laws, labor laws.

I mean, this

10

list is so broad that it would cover the example Your Honor

11

gave that if somebody ran over a pedestrian while delivering

12

opioids, the Sacklers get a release for that too.

13

it's just an impossibly broad release that shouldn't be

14

approved by the Court.

15

And Your Honor, who does it cover?

contributing something, but it is not the thousand-plus

about throughout this case, that there's -- according to

5

Your Honor, another factor in the Metromedia

just can't...

say that because $4.325 billion won't pay off or resolve the

22

opioid crisis, you shouldn't take it.

23

really analyze what the alternatives are, and of course, how

24

tied in it is to the plan, and who is covered by the

25

release.

212-267-6868

I mean, it just seems really boneheaded to

I think you need to

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 259
1

MR. FOGELMAN:

Understood, Your Honor.

One other

2

factor that the Court in the Second Circuit mentioned was

3

whether the estate receives substantial consideration.

4

address that point in terms of Exhibit H and in terms of

5

very few, if any, individuals providing contribution.

6

We

I want to just point out that Garrett Lynam, the

7

Executor of the Sackler Estate, was asked a question.

"So,

8

for example, all the facts that the release provision -- and

9

I believe it's discussed before -- but it references his

10

financial advisor, his attorneys, accountants, investment

11

bankers, consultants, experts, and other professionals, none

12

of those are giving a financial contribution to the estate,

13

right?:

And he answered, "Correct."

14

Richard Sackler testified that, "Question: I have

15

just one, or expect to have just one question to you, other

16

than members of the Sackler Family or Trust, in which they

17

may be beneficiaries, are you aware of any personal entity

18

that will be contributing monetarily to the more than $4

19

billion in settlement payments that are contemplated by

20

Purdue's plan.

21

Answer: I am not aware of any."

And Your Honor, with regard to the Sacklers

22

themselves, I think there is a really important question

23

here about the use of their trust fund assets as opposed to

24

their personal assets.

25

the Sacklers themselves are actually personally contributing

It's not clear on this record that

shield, Your Honor --

4

MR. FOGELMAN:

It's a sword because they're trying

to use their contribution into the estate by their trust to

release.

Secondly, if in fact their own assets would be

insufficient to make the payments and there is, as I think

the record is clear, at least say an issue as to whether in

24

a contested context, third parties could get at the trust

THE COURT:

10

Okay.

MR. FOGELMAN:

I just wanted to make the point

11

that it's a test of, you know, who's provided substantial

12

contributions.

On this record, it's not clear if the

MR. FOGELMAN:

Yes.

They're

Yes, Your Honor.

On subject

19

matter jurisdiction, Your Honor, I just wanted to briefly

20

touch a couple of points that have been raised.

21

third-party releases do not arise under Title 11.

22

nothing in the lawsuits of the States and individuals

23

against the Sacklers, lawsuits that predated the bankruptcy,

24

that arise under Title 11.

25

State substantive laws cited in those complaints that

212-267-6868

Your Honor,
There's

They instead arose under the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 265
1

alleged causes of actions against the Sacklers.

2

And so, you know, just because there is a plan and

3

releases are included in the plan, does not mean that the

4

settlement agreement -- I'm sorry -- that the litigations

5

themselves arise under the Court's core jurisdiction.

6

The correct question is whether the Court has

7

jurisdiction over the lawsuits filed by the sovereign states

8

and individuals, not whether the Court has subject matter

9

jurisdiction over confirming a plan.

And that issue was

10

addressed in the Ninth Circuit Dunmore v. United States, 358

11

F.3d 1107 (9th Cir. 2004).

12

presented with a mixture of core and non-THE COURT:

13

14

determine whether the Bankruptcy Court could enter a final

15

order for that claim.

16

17

brief as well.

18

The Ninth Circuit said, when
core

And that's a similar holding from the

Judge Bernstein wrote in the Drier case, 429 B.R.

19

112, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), the question is not whether the

20

court has jurisdiction over the settlement, but whether it

21

has jurisdiction over the attempt to enjoin the creditors'

22

unasserted claims against the third party.

You've got to

23

break it down and look at what's at issue.

In this case,

24

it’s the lawsuits themselves, not just the plan.

25

the fact that it's part of a plan, doesn't confer core

Let's move

I disagree with Your Honor's

I don't think that's fair --

15

THE COURT:

Well --

16

MR. FOGELMAN:

-- or correct.

Your Honor, the

17

reason that it has to be the case that Your Honor -- that

18

you can't have core jurisdiction over a lawsuit between

19

third parties that is included in a plan, the reason that

20

has to be true is that it's a bedrock principle of subject

21

matter jurisdiction.

22

The Supreme Court, in Insurance Corporation of

23

Ireland v. Compagnie Des Bauxites, 456 U.S. 694, 702, from

24

1982, wrote, "No action of the parties can confer subject

25

matter jurisdiction upon a federal court."

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 268
1

And so, Your Honor, if the Court doesn't have

2

jurisdiction over the lawsuit from one third party against

3

the Sacklers, then simply by putting it in a plan, if that

4

were permitted, you'd be doing exactly what Insurance Corp.

5

of Ireland said you can't, which is manufactured in

6

jurisdiction.

7

anything you put inside a plan automatically comes within

8

the Court's core jurisdiction.

9

Plans are not magic.

It can't be that

The Johns Manville case also noted it was

10

inappropriate for the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin third-party

11

claims against third-party non-debtors solely on the basis

12

of that third-party's financial contribution to a Debtor's

13

estate.

14

subject matter jurisdiction over any non-debtor third party

15

by structuring a plan in such a way that it depended upon

16

the third-party contributions.

17

If that were possible, a debtor could create

As we have made clear, subject matter jurisdiction

18

cannot be conferred by consent of the parties.

here, Your Honor, again, just by including these releases in

disagreed and you found that because this is a plan, it was

22

core jurisdiction of the Court, it would violate Article 3

23

of the Constitution for a bankruptcy judge to ultimately

24

make the decision on whether the lawsuits filed by sovereign

25

states and individuals against the Sacklers can be released.

10

We want to make clear, first of all, Your Honor,

11

is that Canadian creditors not -- and there's testimony to

12

this -- they were approached.

13

fact -- they were not approached by the Debtors' Special

14

Committee, they were not approached by Debtors' counsel.

15

They did independently try to become involved in this case,

16

but unfortunately it didn't result in -- what they hoped

17

for.

18

Mr. Dubel testified to this

So, the irony here is, Judge, you've got ten

parties that really are trying to figure out whether they

22

that desperately wanted to be a part of this, expected to be

I didn't want to cut you off

I just thought, on this one point, as we got into

8

your argument, it seemed to be covering jurisdiction

9

generally, as opposed to just the release.

But if you could

10

cover both points on Wednesday, that's fine.

11

know if you have any other points on the release?

12

MR. UNDERWOOD:

But I don't

With the respect to the releases,

13

if you'll just give me one very quick comment.

Ultimately,

14

I don't think that there are points that can't be addressed

16

creditors are not beneficiaries of any form of channeling,

17

injunction or trust.

18

two things:

25

against the US entities as opposed to the Canadian entities.

212-267-6868

You're not getting money directly as part of the

But I think the Debtors would say

First, it's far from clear that your clients

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 274
1

And when you read the proofs of claim, I think there is some

2

question as to, you know, how is the claim actually against

3

the US entities?

4

That's point one.

Point two is, I think they would say that the

5

money that is going to unsecured creditors wouldn't go to

6

them but for the release, and but for the Sackler

7

settlement, because the parties that, in essence, would

8

swallow up that money, that would be going to the unsecured

9

creditors, aren't swallowing it up because of the money that

10

the Sacklers are paying, which is supported by the

11

liquidation analysis, which has unsecured creditors getting

12

nothing.

13

So, I think that's their argument.

I would also say, you know, that look, if you look

at the breadth of case law, there are releases, and there

are releases.

4

releases that are related to the Debtors' business and

professionals that are -- and no question -- commonplace.

think that the scope of these releases is something greater,

The UCC letter which was attached to Mr.

7

discovery, the financial information and the analysis of the

Docket Number 3460, among many other things, talks about

That evidence,

10

11

documents produced by the ACs; 40,000 documents produced by

be no assurance that the money will go to abatement if there

are direct recoveries, as opposed to, I think citing

Maryland -- and I apologize again, both to Mr. Edmunds and

are, in essence telling you, is that in their view, 99.999

under, you know, some of the theories we heard today,

including my often very dear friend Mr. Fogelman -- and how

he lives with the dissonance of being one of the hardest

13

But under his theory, defining the governmental

with one lawyer, with a $20 billion asserted claim, says

19

There's no way that anybody actually believes that that can

21

be the right answer.

22

You Honor, with respect to record evidence, sort

23

of, on the direct claims versus estate claims, I would point

24

the Court to paragraph 239 of our brief, where we clearly

state that we believe that the estate claims are very

Because when it comes to invading the corpus of trusts, when

you have a (indiscernible) claim for estate value that was

of your trust.

to the amount alleged.

pretty convincing-looking case law and statutory cites to me

I

turn to Mr. Tobak.

11

When either litigants in this case or those who

12

report on what's happening refer to this plan as the Sackler

13

plan or the Sacklers, you know, exploiting a loophole in the

14

Bankruptcy Code, it's almost impossible to overstate how

15

painful that is, not to me, but to the UCC and the AHC and

16

the MSGE and the Native American tribes and the adult PI

17

victims and the NASPI victims and the MAS medical monitoring

18

claims and the hospitals and the third-party payers and the

19

ratepayers and the schools.

20

Every one of those groups had to look deep inside

21

and figure out whether they would support this plan or not.

22

The Sacklers are the defendants.

23

They're not the voters.

24

They're not the supporters.

25

fact, they didn't even see this plan for months.

212-267-6868

That's all they are.

They're not the proponents.
They're not the craftsmen.

6

But the consensus of everyone in the case, except for ten

7

people basically, is that we're not getting more voluntarily

9

We all wish there was more.

With that, Your Honor, I'll ask Mr. Tobak to

Page 296
1

hearings, the plan treats claims against the Debtors and has

2

refocused at length today on claims against release parties

3

and shareholder release parties that relate to the Debtors.

4

Thus the plan treats Canadian municipal and First Nation

5

creditors' claims against the Debtors or claims against the

6

shareholder release parties that relate to the Debtors.

7

But unlike the domestic federal -- domestic non-

8

federal public claimants, the Canadian municipalities and

9

Canadian First Nations can look to a separate company, to

10

Purdue Canada for recoveries and, to the extent that they

11

have claims against any shareholder release party that

12

relates to the conduct of Purdue Canada and not the conduct

13

of the Debtors, can look to those parties for those non-

14

debtor-related claims.

15

fundamentally different from the claims that are treated

16

through NOAT.

17

That means that they're both

As a consequence of that, they've received

18

different classification and treatment under the plan.

19

They're classified in the class 11-C as a general unsecured

20

creditor and, unlike the participants in NOAT, don’t receive

21

distributions on account of abatement.

22

to the extent that they succeed in proving their claim and

23

withstand the objection that the Debtors would intend to

24

pursue, would receive those recoveries directly in the form

25

of a recovery from the pool of money set aside from those

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

They could however,

516-608-2400

Page 297
1

creditors, unlike NOAT that receive abatement funds which

2

are obviously subject to a great deal of carefully

3

negotiated covenants and promises about how those funds

4

would be used.

5

To the extent that this argument is intended as an

6

argument that the releases -- the fact that these claims

7

would not be channeled matters for the Metromedia analysis,

8

Your Honor, I would say as we sorted out and as Mr.

9

Kaminetzky noted, Metromedia is not a matter of factors and

10

prongs and ultimately turns on the importance of the release

11

to the plan and the fact that these claims, as is

12

appropriate given their different treatment, are not

13

channeled does not matter for the Metromedia analysis of why

14

the third-party release of those claims with respect to

15

claims against or related to the Debtors is appropriate.

16

Finally, to turn to the sovereign immunity

17

argument, I think it's very clear, as we set forth in our

18

brief, that Section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code abrogates

19

sovereign immunity and abrogates the sovereign immunity of a

20

foreign -- of a foreign entity, whether it be a foreign

21

state or one of its instrumentalities.

22

no case that we've been pointed to or evidence that we've

23

been shown that a foreign sovereign immunity has any

24

application here.

25

And there's really

That's I think all we had to say on that argument,

unless Your Honor has any further questions.

THE COURT:

And then you

3

were also going to address the insurance companies'

4

argument.

5

MR. TOBAK:

Yes.

With respect to Gulf

6

Underwriters, ultimately I think the safest thing to point

7

out is that we obviously do not represent the IACs or non-

8

debtor entities that were party to that settlement

9

agreement.

And I think the safest point is to say that that

10

point has been the subject of discussion and I think should

11

be continuing to be the subject of discussion.

hand, to the extent the analysis for the release of those

13

claims is really the same as the analysis for all those

14

which we've discussed.

What I did want to ask, and just to get

confirmation to this point, is that the stipulation that we

516-608-2400

Page 303

release further; secondly, while I believe I fully

2

understand Mr. Huebner's point, that it just can't be the

3

case that one creditor or one public creditor could veto or

4

crater this plan, there is still risk on all sides with

5

respect to the plan and potential appeals of the plan if

6

only insofar as it would pertain to delay and cost and of

7

course the delay here includes not only getting money to

individual personal injury creditors but also in getting

money to governmental entities to abate or help to abate the

opioid crisis.

message in what I've just said, it is that if an agreement

can be reached with the objecting -- remaining objecting

relief in the plan, the parties should focus on that tonight
