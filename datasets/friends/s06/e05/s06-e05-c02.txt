Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Gunther: Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Joey Tribbiani: Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Monica Geller: Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Joey Tribbiani: There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Chandler Bing: You left a shoe here?!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Chandler Bing: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Joey Tribbiani: Great! Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Monica Geller: Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, all right.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Chandler Bing: Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Phoebe Buffay: Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Monica Geller: Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Monica Geller: Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
