Monica Geller: Hey, where is everybody?
Rachel Green: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Monica Geller: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Rachel Green: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Rachel Green: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Monica Geller: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Rachel Green: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica Geller: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Rachel Green: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Monica Geller: Judy.
Rachel Green: Who?
Monica Geller: Julie.
Rachel Green: What?!
Monica Geller: Jody!
Rachel Green: You were with Julie?
Monica Geller: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Rachel Green: Oh. Oh my God.
Monica Geller: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Rachel Green: Yeah, right. Sure!
Monica Geller: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Rachel Green: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Monica Geller: That is not true!
Rachel Green: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Monica Geller: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Rachel Green: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
