Ross Geller: Oh my God, you guys!!
Chandler Bing: Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Ross Geller: Who?
Chandler Bing: Richard!
Ross Geller: What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Chandler Bing: Oh you knew that. Good!
Monica Geller: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Monica Geller: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Ross Geller: Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Monica Geller: Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Ross Geller: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Monica Geller: If the school finds out you're fired.
Ross Geller: Hmm.
Monica Geller: She's leaving for three months.
Chandler Bing: For camp!
Ross Geller: Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Monica Geller: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Ross Geller: No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Monica Geller: Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Ross Geller: I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
