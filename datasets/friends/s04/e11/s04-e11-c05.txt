Phoebe Abbott: It's open! Come in!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Phoebe Abbott: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I'm late.
Phoebe Abbott: Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Phoebe Abbott: No, I was working on my pottery.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Phoebe Abbott: Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, erotiery!
Phoebe Abbott: Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Phoebe Abbott: I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: Why not?
Phoebe Abbott: Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Phoebe Abbott: No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I get a puppy!!
Phoebe Abbott: Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Phoebe Buffay: Why?
Phoebe Abbott: I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Phoebe Abbott: I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, I'm sorry.
