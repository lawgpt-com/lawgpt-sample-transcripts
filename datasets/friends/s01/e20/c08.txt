Rachel Green: Mindy.
Mindy Hunter: Hey, you.
Rachel Green: Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Mindy Hunter: Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Rachel Green: Sure we should... So.
Mindy Hunter: Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Mindy Hunter: Will you be my maid of honour?
Rachel Green: Of course!
Mindy Hunter: Oh that's so great!
Rachel Green: Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Mindy Hunter: That's all!
Rachel Green: Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Mindy Hunter: That's not all.
Rachel Green: Oh sure it is!
Mindy Hunter: Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Rachel Green: Um, what- what would make you think that?
Mindy Hunter: Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Rachel Green: Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Mindy Hunter: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Rachel Green: What? What's what you were afraid of?
Mindy Hunter: Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
Rachel Green: What?
Mindy Hunter: I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Rachel Green: Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Mindy Hunter: What do you mean?
Rachel Green: Smell familiar?
Mindy Hunter: Oh no.
Rachel Green: Oh, I am so sorry.
Mindy Hunter: No me, I am so sorry...
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my.
