Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: What are you doing?
Chandler Bing: Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.
Rachel Green: Oh, anything yet?
Chandler Bing: Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
#ALL#: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
Monica Geller: No, that seems about right.
Joey Tribbiani: Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Rachel Green: Joey, that was formula.
Joey Tribbiani: We gotta get more of that.
Chandler Bing: You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Rachel Green: Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Chandler Bing: Alright I feel youger already!
Chandler Bing: Yah, I think I broke my hip.
