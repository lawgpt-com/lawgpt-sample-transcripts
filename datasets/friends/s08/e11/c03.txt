Doug: Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Chandler Bing: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Monica Geller: Yes, hi.
Doug: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
Chandler Bing: I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
Doug: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
Monica Geller: No leg-chewing for us sir.
Doug: Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
Monica Geller: I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
Doug: Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Monica Geller: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Chandler Bing: No.
Monica Geller: That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
