Phoebe Buffay: Come in.
Ryan: Hey baby, I'm back...
Phoebe Buffay: Hey Ryan, what's up?
Ryan: What's goin' on?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Ryan: Chicken or small?
Phoebe Buffay: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Ryan: Why aren't you at home in bed?
Phoebe Buffay: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Ryan: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, ohh.
Ryan: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Ryan: Can I please see your face?
Phoebe Buffay: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Ryan: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Phoebe Buffay: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Ryan: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
Phoebe Buffay: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Ryan: Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
