Joey Tribbiani: Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Monica Geller: Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Monica Geller: No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Joey Tribbiani: That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Chandler Bing: So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Monica Geller: Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, you wish.
Phoebe Buffay: "You wish."
Monica Geller: Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Chandler Bing: Who?
Phoebe Buffay: Marcia and Chester.
Monica Geller: Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Chandler Bing: Hmm.
Monica Geller: Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Chandler Bing: Oh.
Phoebe Buffay: I see what you're doing!
Monica Geller: Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Chandler Bing: Oh-oh.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
