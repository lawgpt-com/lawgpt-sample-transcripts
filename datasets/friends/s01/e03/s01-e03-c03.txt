Chandler Bing: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Joey Tribbiani: What are you talking about? Keep it!
Phoebe Buffay: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Rachel Green: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Monica Geller: We're with you. We got it.
