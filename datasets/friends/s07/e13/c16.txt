Phoebe Buffay: Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Marge: Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
Earl: I'm right here!!!!
Phoebe Buffay: Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Earl: Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Earl: Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Phoebe Buffay: No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Earl: Why?!
Phoebe Buffay: Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Earl: I thought it was toner.
Phoebe Buffay: No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Earl: Really?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yes.
Earl: How?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Earl: Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
Phoebe Buffay: No, it's fate!
Earl: It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Earl: I'm actually the office manager.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Earl: Well, was there anything else?!
Phoebe Buffay: Sure! Umm, where are you from?
Earl: Philadelphia.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Earl: Really?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Earl: Yeah-yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Earl: Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Earl: Yeah.
