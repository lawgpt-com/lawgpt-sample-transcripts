Ross Geller: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Monica Geller: Yeah! I think that's great!
Ross Geller: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Monica Geller: Oh... How are they?
Ross Geller: Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey Tribbiani: Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
Ross Geller: Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani: That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Ross Geller: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica Geller: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica Geller: Yeah, so?
Ross Geller: Wow!
Joey Tribbiani: Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Monica Geller: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey Tribbiani: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
Ross Geller: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Joey Tribbiani: ...No...

Chandler Bing: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Chandler Bing: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
Monica Geller: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Chandler Bing: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
Monica Geller: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Chandler Bing: What is so funny about that?
Monica Geller: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Chandler Bing: Did you tell her what we talked about?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah....
Chandler Bing: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Monica Geller: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica Geller: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Chandler Bing: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Monica Geller: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
Ross Geller: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Joey Tribbiani: Not knowing when to shut up...
Ross Geller: Yep! That's my thing...
