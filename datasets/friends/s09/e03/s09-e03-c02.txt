Joey Tribbiani: Here you are.
Rachel Green: Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Ross Geller: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Rachel Green: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Joey Tribbiani: nan
Rachel Green: Every time?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhuh.
Ross Geller: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Rachel Green: All right, I trust you.
Ross Geller: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Rachel Green: I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Joey Tribbiani: nan
Phoebe Buffay: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Joey Tribbiani: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
Phoebe Buffay: Look at you all grown up.
Joey Tribbiani: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Phoebe Buffay: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
Joey Tribbiani: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Phoebe Buffay: Done. Oh good, really?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay: Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Joey Tribbiani: Poophack...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller.
Joey Tribbiani: nan
