Joey Tribbiani: So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Dina: I'm 16.
Joey Tribbiani: See you in 2003.
Cecilia: You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Cecilia: Yeah, thanks.
Joey Tribbiani: No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Cecilia: Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Joey Tribbiani: Joey.
Cecilia: Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
The Writer: It wasn't my decision!
Cecilia: I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Cecilia: All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Cecilia: You're so welcome.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Cecilia: Is that supposed to be me?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Cecilia: Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
Joey Tribbiani: I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
