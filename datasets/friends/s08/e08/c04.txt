Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Rachel Green: I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
Phoebe Buffay: It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Rachel Green: All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
Leonard Green: I just called a friend of mine.
Rachel Green: Yeah?
Leonard Green: I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
Rachel Green: Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
Leonard Green: What is it sweetie?
Rachel Green: There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Leonard Green: What?!
Rachel Green: I'm sorry daddy.
Leonard Green: I don't believe this!!
Rachel Green: Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
Leonard Green: Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
Rachel Green: Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
