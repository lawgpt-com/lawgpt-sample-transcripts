Chip Matthews: ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Monica Geller: Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Chip Matthews: You know where I work!
Monica Geller: I do?
Chip Matthews: The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Monica Geller: You still work at the multiplex?
Chip Matthews: Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Monica Geller: Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Chip Matthews: Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
