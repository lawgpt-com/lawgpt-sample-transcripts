Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Wheel!
Chandler Bing: Of!
Joey Tribbiani: Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Chandler Bing: You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Joey Tribbiani: I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Chandler Bing: No, Janice.
Joey Tribbiani: Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Chandler Bing: You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Joey Tribbiani: No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Chandler Bing: Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Joey Tribbiani: Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Chandler Bing: Well, there you go.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, what do you want me to say?
Chandler Bing: I want you to say that you like her!
Joey Tribbiani: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Chandler Bing: Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
