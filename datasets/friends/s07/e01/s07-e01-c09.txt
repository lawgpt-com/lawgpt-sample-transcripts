Ross Geller: Guess who?
Rachel Green: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
Rachel Green: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Ross Geller: Still thinking about it huh?
Rachel Green: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Ross Geller: Oh, who cares?
Rachel Green: I care!
Ross Geller: And so do I.
Rachel Green: Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Ross Geller: Okay. Sure.
Rachel Green: Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Ross Geller: No!
