Joey Tribbiani: Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Molly: You mean, when you were a baby.
Joey Tribbiani: Sure.
Monica Geller: Would you stop staring at her?
Chandler Bing: I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Monica Geller: What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Ross Geller: Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
Chandler Bing: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Monica Geller: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
Molly: I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Ross Geller: Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
Molly: Bye.
Monica Geller: They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Molly: I think it's sweet.
Chandler Bing: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Rachel Green: Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Joey Tribbiani: Why not?
Rachel Green: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
Joey Tribbiani: So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
Ross Geller: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
Ross Geller: What are you, a child?
Joey Tribbiani: Yes!
Ross Geller: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Joey Tribbiani: Fine.
Monica Geller: Take me home!
