Charlton Heston: Hello! Who's in there?
Joey Tribbiani: How ya doin'?
Charlton Heston: Who in the hell are you?
Joey Tribbiani: I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Charlton Heston: Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Charlton Heston: You're in this picture?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Charlton Heston: Joey, right?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Charlton Heston: Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Charlton Heston: Listen to me!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, yeah.
Charlton Heston: I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Charlton Heston: Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
