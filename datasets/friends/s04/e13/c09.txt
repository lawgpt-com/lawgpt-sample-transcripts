Chandler Bing: Did she call?
Phoebe Buffay: No, sorry.
Chandler Bing: All right, maybe I should call her.
Joey Tribbiani: No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Ross Geller: He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
Chandler Bing: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Ross Geller: How might you be wrong?
Chandler Bing: Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Chandler Bing: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Ross Geller: That's all you're basing this on?
Chandler Bing: That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!!
