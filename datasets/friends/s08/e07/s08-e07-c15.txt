Rachel Green: What is this?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
Rachel Green: You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Joey Tribbiani: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
Rachel Green: But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm loud!
Rachel Green: It's gonna be up all night!
Joey Tribbiani: I'm up all night!
Rachel Green: It's gonna poop!
Joey Tribbiani: Hello!
Rachel Green: What about all the women you want to bring home?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Rachel Green: Joey, are you sure?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Rachel Green: I want me to stay too.
Joey Tribbiani: Ohh!
Rachel Green: Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Joey Tribbiani: I know! I found it on the street.
Rachel Green: Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know.
Rachel Green: It's moving.
Joey Tribbiani: Ew.
Rachel Green: It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh! Ah! Okay!
