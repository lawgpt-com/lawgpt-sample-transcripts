Phoebe Buffay: Oh there it is.
Monica Geller: That's not your regular dry cleaners.
Phoebe Buffay: I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
Monica Geller: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
Monica Geller: Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.

Phoebe Buffay: Okay.

Guy: Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s... Wow!
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Guy: I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
Guy: I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
Phoebe Buffay: A little. Now you're talking.
Guy: Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
Phoebe Buffay: I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Monica Geller: Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Phoebe Buffay: She must've left.
