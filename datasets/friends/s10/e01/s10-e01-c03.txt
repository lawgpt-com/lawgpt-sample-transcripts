Joey Tribbiani: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Ross Geller: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Joey Tribbiani: I understand...
Ross Geller: No, I'll do it.
Chandler Bing: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Phoebe Buffay: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Mike Hannigan: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
Phoebe Buffay: Aaah... you're not good at this...
Mike Hannigan: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Phoebe Buffay: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
Mike Hannigan: Oh...
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Mike Hannigan: Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Phoebe Buffay: Why not?
Mike Hannigan: I have a date.
Phoebe Buffay: You have a... You have a date? With who?
Mike Hannigan: Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
Phoebe Buffay: You have... have a girlfriend?
Mike Hannigan: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
Phoebe Buffay: For how long?
Mike Hannigan: Three months.
Phoebe Buffay: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Mike Hannigan: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Mike Hannigan: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
Phoebe Buffay: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Ross Geller: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Charlie Wheeler: Okay... Good luck.
Rachel Green: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Joey Tribbiani: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Rachel Green: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh...
Rachel Green: Still nervous?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Ross Geller: Hey Rach...
Rachel Green: Yeah!
Ross Geller: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Rachel Green: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Ross Geller: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah?
Ross Geller: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Joey Tribbiani: You kissed.
Ross Geller: Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
Joey Tribbiani: I saw you.
Ross Geller: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Ross Geller: What?
Joey Tribbiani: It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
Ross Geller: Are you serious?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah... Now I have something...
Ross Geller: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh... uh... look... before you...
Ross Geller: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
Joey Tribbiani: I am those things, yeah.
Ross Geller: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Joey Tribbiani: Dude!
Ross Geller: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Joey Tribbiani: I can't think of anything.
Ross Geller: Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Rachel Green: So hi!
Ross Geller: Hi!
Rachel Green: So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Ross Geller: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Rachel Green: Oh! That's great!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Rachel Green: Oh, so everything's okay?
Ross Geller: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Rachel Green: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Ross Geller: Well, I'm so excited about this.
Rachel Green: Really? Excited?
Ross Geller: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Rachel Green: Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Joey Tribbiani: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Rachel Green: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
