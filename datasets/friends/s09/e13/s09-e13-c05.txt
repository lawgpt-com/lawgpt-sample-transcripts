Rachel Green: Who is it?
Gavin Mitchell: Gavin! I brought you some soup.
Rachel Green: Why?
Gavin Mitchell: I heard you were sick...
Rachel Green: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.
Gavin Mitchell: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
Rachel Green: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Gavin Mitchell: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
Rachel Green: Oh no no no.
Gavin Mitchell: So I had fun last night.
Rachel Green: So did I.
Gavin Mitchell: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
Rachel Green: It's just a cold.
Gavin Mitchell: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
Rachel Green: What? What's the matter?
Gavin Mitchell: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Rachel Green: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
Gavin Mitchell: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
Rachel Green: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Gavin Mitchell: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
Rachel Green: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Molly: Hi!
Rachel Green: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Molly: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
Rachel Green: Right, right, yes!
Molly: Don't panic!
Rachel Green: What?
Molly: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
Rachel Green: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
Gavin Mitchell: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
Molly: Hello! I just go and get Emma.
Rachel Green: OK.
Gavin Mitchell: So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Rachel Green: I thought it was Ross.
Gavin Mitchell: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
Rachel Green: There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Gavin Mitchell: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
Rachel Green: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
Gavin Mitchell: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
Rachel Green: Yes.
Gavin Mitchell: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
Rachel Green: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
Gavin Mitchell: Don't be. It's just bad timing.
Rachel Green: So seriously...rodeo clown?
Gavin Mitchell: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
