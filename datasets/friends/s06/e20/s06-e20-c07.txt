Chandler Bing: Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Monica Geller: Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Chandler Bing: Am I naked again?!
Monica Geller: We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Chandler Bing: Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Monica Geller: Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Chandler Bing: Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
