Monica Geller: Hey guys!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Monica Geller: That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Rachel Green: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Rachel Green: We're having a party.
Monica Geller: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Ross Geller: No.
Rachel Green: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Chandler Bing: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Ross Geller: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Monica Geller: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Chandler Bing: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Rachel Green: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Ross Geller: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Rachel Green: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Monica Geller: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler Bing: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Monica Geller: Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
