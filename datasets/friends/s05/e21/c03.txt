Chandler Bing: Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Gary: Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Chandler Bing: Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Gary: Yeah?
Chandler Bing: It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Gary: What's up?
Chandler Bing: Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Gary: Sure. Okay.
Chandler Bing: Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Gary: Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Chandler Bing: You mean scared.
Gary: No, I mean happy.
Chandler Bing: Scared? Happy?
Gary: Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Chandler Bing: I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Gary: I know! I can't wait!
Chandler Bing: Were you're parents happy, or something?
Gary: Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Chandler Bing: Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Gary: So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Gary: No, it's too soon for you guys.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, you're right about that.
