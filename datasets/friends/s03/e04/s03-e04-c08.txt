Janice Litman Goralnik: No, thank you. Chandler!
Chandler Bing: Hello, Janice.
Janice Litman Goralnik: What are you doing here?
Chandler Bing: Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Janice Litman Goralnik: Are you being British?!
Chandler Bing: No. Not anymore.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Where is this party?
Chandler Bing: Here in Chelsea.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Who's party is it?
Chandler Bing: A woman's
Janice Litman Goralnik: What woman?!
Chandler Bing: Chelsea.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Chandler Bing: Can I be that guy?
