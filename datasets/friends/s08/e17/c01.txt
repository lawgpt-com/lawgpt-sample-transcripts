Joey Tribbiani: Oh God! That's Rachel!
Monica Geller: Joey, you have to talk to her!
Joey Tribbiani: No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!
Rachel Green: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey Rachel!
Rachel Green: Is Joey here?
Chandler Bing: I don't see him. Do you see him?
Monica Geller: I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Rachel Green: Well, at least you make each other laugh.
Monica Geller: What's up?
Rachel Green: Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
Monica Geller: We were playing a game.
Rachel Green: Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
Monica Geller: Sure.
Chandler Bing: What?! No! No!
Rachel Green: All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
Monica Geller: Okay, did you hear that?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
Monica Geller: Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Joey Tribbiani: I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Chandler Bing: I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Monica Geller: Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
Joey Tribbiani: All right so, so what do I do?
Monica Geller: This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
Chandler Bing: We didn't play it!!
