Dr. Zane: It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Dr. Zane: Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Phoebe Buffay: Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Dr. Zane: Um-hmm, five actually.
Phoebe Buffay: Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Dr. Zane: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Phoebe Buffay: That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Alice Knight: Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Alice Knight: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Phoebe Buffay: Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Dr. Zane: No, I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Frank Buffay Jr.: I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
