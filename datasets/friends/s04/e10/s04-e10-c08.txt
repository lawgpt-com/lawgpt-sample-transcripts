Monica Geller: Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
A Waiter: Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
Joey Tribbiani: There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
The Waiter: Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Monica Geller: Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
The Waiter: Because we can remember them.
Monica Geller: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
The Waiter: Well, sure, that too.
Monica Geller: Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
The Waiter: Can't hear you!
Monica Geller: A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Joey Tribbiani: No ma'am.
The Waiter: Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
