Ross Geller: Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Monica Geller: No, sorry.
Rachel Green: Well where's Amanda?

Rachel Green: I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Monica Geller: Ross, cough drops, please?
Ross Geller: At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Rachel Green: Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Ross Geller: You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Monica Geller: You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Rachel Green: Ohh, that is soo sad.
Monica Geller: And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
