Monica Geller: What uh-What did you-What?!
Richard Burke: I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Monica Geller: Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Richard Burke: Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Monica Geller: Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Richard Burke: I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Monica Geller: What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Richard Burke: Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Monica Geller: What were you doing in Africa?
Richard Burke: Working with blind kids.
Monica Geller: Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Richard Burke: Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Monica Geller: Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Richard Burke: You are?
Monica Geller: Yeah!
Richard Burke: Why?
Monica Geller: Why? Because of the government.
