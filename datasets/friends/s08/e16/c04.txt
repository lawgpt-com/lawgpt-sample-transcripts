Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Hi!
Monica Geller: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Don: Oh, hello. Hello.
Phoebe Buffay: Soul mate.
Chandler Bing: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Soul mate.
Monica Geller: So, what have you guys been doing?
Don: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Monica Geller: I know! What is this, 1985?!
Don: That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
Monica Geller: Not really.
Chandler Bing: What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
Monica Geller: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Don: Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
Don: You're kidding me!
Monica Geller: No!
Don: Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Monica Geller: Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.

Chandler Bing: What are you doing?!
Phoebe Buffay: Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...
Chandler Bing: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Phoebe Buffay: They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, good work.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Monica Geller: Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him.
Phoebe Buffay: Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
