Joey Tribbiani: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.

Joey Tribbiani: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.

Joey Tribbiani: What a phony.
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Joey Tribbiani: Sir.
Mr. Douglas: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Chandler Bing: Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Mr. Douglas: I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Chandler Bing: It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Mr. Douglas: Rough numbers?
Joey Tribbiani: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Douglas: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Chandler Bing: Uh, if you say so sir.
Joey Tribbiani: Joseph's good, isn't he?
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm going to kill you.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Chandler Bing: Why?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
