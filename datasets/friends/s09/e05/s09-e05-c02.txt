Chandler Bing: Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
Ken: That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
Chandler Bing: Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
Claudia: I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Chandler Bing: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Claudia: Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?
Chandler Bing: Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
Ken: That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...
Chandler Bing: Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
Ken: I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?
Chandler Bing: I always liked you, Ken.
