Waiter: I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
Ross Geller: Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Waiter: Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
Ross Geller: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Waiter: Ooh...
Ross Geller: Just the crab cakes.
Waiter #2: What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
Waiter: Just get out of here, okay?
Ross Geller: What's - what's going on?
Waiter: Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
Ross Geller: What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Waiter: Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
Ross Geller: This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
