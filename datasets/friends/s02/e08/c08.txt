Chandler Bing: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Ross Geller: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Chandler Bing: So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Rachel Green: Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Ross Geller: Hi.
Rachel Green: Where you goin'?
Ross Geller: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Rachel Green: Oh.
Ross Geller: No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Rachel Green: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Ross Geller: Well, uh.
Joey Tribbiani: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Rachel Green: Really?
Ross Geller: Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Rachel Green: Oh, god.
Chandler Bing: Ohhh.
Rachel Green: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Ross Geller: I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Rachel Green: Let me get my coat.
Ross Geller: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.

Chandler Bing: No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Rachel Green: Well what is it? Let me see.
Ross Geller: Hey, someone order a coat?
Rachel Green: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Ross Geller: He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Chandler Bing: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Rachel Green: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Chandler Bing: No!
Rachel Green: Come on.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Chandler Bing: Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Ross Geller: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Rachel Green: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Ross Geller: No, you don't.
Rachel Green: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Rachel Green: What is this? Ross, what is this?
Chandler Bing: Good luck.
Ross Geller: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Rachel Green: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Ross Geller: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Rachel Green: Just a waitress?
Ross Geller: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Rachel Green: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Ross Geller: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Rachel Green: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Ross Geller: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
