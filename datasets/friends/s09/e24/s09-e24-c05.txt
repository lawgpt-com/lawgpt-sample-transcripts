Charlie Wheeler: Hey! There you are!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
Charlie Wheeler: I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Charlie Wheeler: You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
Charlie Wheeler: Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Charlie Wheeler: Yeah...
Charlie Wheeler: ... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Charlie Wheeler: I think we need to talk...!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
