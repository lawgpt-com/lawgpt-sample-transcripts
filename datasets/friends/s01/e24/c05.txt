Melanie: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Joey Tribbiani: Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Melanie: Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Joey Tribbiani: Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Melanie: M-Me again?
Joey Tribbiani: Sure! Why not?
Melanie: Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
unknown: nan
Melanie: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Joey Tribbiani: How do you mean?
Melanie: I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
