Monica Geller: Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
The Food Critic: Still?
Monica Geller: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
The Food Critic: I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Joey Tribbiani: Either eat it, or be in it.
Monica Geller: Spoon? So, what do you think?
The Food Critic: I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soup is abysmal.
Joey Tribbiani: Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.

The Cooking Teacher: Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
Monica Geller: I can.
The Cooking Teacher: Okay, go ahead.
Monica Geller: Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
The Cooking Teacher: That's very good, what's your name?
Monica Geller: Monica.
The Cooking Teacher: Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Monica Geller: Okay.
