Phoebe Buffay: Doing it on this table.
Chandler Bing: Wow!
Joey Tribbiani: Exellent dream score.
Ross Geller: Why, why, why would you dream that?
Chandler Bing: More importantly, was I any good?
Rachel Green: Well, you were pretty damn good.
Chandler Bing: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Rachel Green: Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross Geller: I love it, when we share.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: You're okay there?
Ross Geller: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
