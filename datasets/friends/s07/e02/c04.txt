Ross Geller: Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Phoebe Buffay: What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
Ross Geller: And they knew about it?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Ross Geller: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Ross Geller: The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
