Monica Geller: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Rachel Green: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Phoebe Buffay: You are just like Jack.
Rachel Green: ...Jack from downstairs?
Phoebe Buffay: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Monica Geller: Ah, the other Jack.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Rachel Green: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Rachel Green: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Phoebe Buffay: Floopy?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Monica Geller: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, like that's a word.
Rachel Green: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Monica Geller: ...Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Rachel Green: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
