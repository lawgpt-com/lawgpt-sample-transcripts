Janice Litman Goralnik: I brought you something.
Chandler Bing: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Janice Litman Goralnik: I had them made special.
Chandler Bing: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Janice Litman Goralnik: That's fine.
Chandler Bing: It is?
Janice Litman Goralnik: Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Chandler Bing: Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Janice Litman Goralnik: No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Chandler Bing: Oh, no I don't.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Chandler Bing: I did, but...
Janice Litman Goralnik: You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
