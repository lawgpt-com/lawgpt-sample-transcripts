Phoebe Buffay: No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Ross Geller: Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Phoebe Buffay: No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Joey Tribbiani: Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Phoebe Buffay: But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes. Not out loud.
Ross Geller: Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no-no-no.
Phoebe Buffay: Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Joey Tribbiani: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Joey Tribbiani: So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
