Monica Geller: Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
Chandler Bing: I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Monica Geller: Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
Chandler Bing: Really? In front of all this people?
Monica Geller: And they love me!
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, she gives the people what they want.
Monica Geller: All right, watch!
Monica Geller: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
Chandler Bing: Are those my wife's nipples?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Chandler Bing: I gotta stop this.
Monica Geller: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Chandler Bing: You, touching yourself, out!
