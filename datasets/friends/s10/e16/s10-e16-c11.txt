Ross Geller: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Monica Geller: Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Ross Geller: Well, it needs to be plicit.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Ross Geller: No, I don't think so.
Phoebe Buffay: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Monica Geller: Yeah. Mine too.
Chandler Bing: Mine was a humdinger.
Ross Geller: O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
Phoebe Buffay: Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Monica Geller: And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Ross Geller: THE HELL I DO!
Ross Geller: I don't get a goodbye?
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Rachel Green: Ross...
Ross Geller: Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
