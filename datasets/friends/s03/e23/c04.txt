Dr. Rhodes: Well that's not a third nipple.
Ross Geller: No?
Dr. Rhodes: First of all, it's on your ass.
Ross Geller: Well then, what is it?!
Dr. Rhodes: Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Dr. Johnson: I'm with Hamilton!
Dr. Rhodes: He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
