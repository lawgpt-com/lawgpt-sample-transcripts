P R O C E E D I N G S

2

THE COURT:

Good afternoon, everyone.

We are here

3

in In re Purdue Pharma L.P., et al on a status conference

4

that I scheduled pertaining to the issue of a motion or

5

motions to come for a stay pending appeal of my order

6

confirming the Chapter 11 plan in this case from September

7

17th.

8
9

The last day I believe to file an appeal is
tomorrow.

So I guess it’s conceivable there would be

10

someone who would not be participating today.

11

purpose of this conference is to put some structure around

12

the process of considering motions for a stay pending appeal

13

of the confirmation order.

14

But the

There were some appeals filed before the order was

15

even entered.

16

motion for a stay pending appeal before the order was

17

entered.

18

this is borne out by the facts of the case, that the plan

19

could not go effective for a considerable time.

20

somewhat unclear to me whether that time runs out in

21

November or some period in December.

22

that rather than rushing ahead and dealing with piecemeal

23

motions for a stay pending appeal, we should have this

24

conference and set a reasonable date for the parties to put

25

something before the Court on a basis that is not rushed.

212-267-6868

And, somewhat surprisingly, at least one

I have been assured by the Debtors, and I believe

It’s

But it seemed to me

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 9
1

So I guess the first question is one for the

2

Debtors, which is to ask them to go through the timing on

3

when at the earliest the Chapter 11 plan could go effective.

4
5

MR. HUEBNER:

Sure, Your Honor.

Can I be heard

clearly in the court?

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. HUEBNER:

Yes.
Okay.

Your Honor, for the record,

8

Marshall Huebner of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP on behalf of

9

the Debtors.

10

Your Honor, the way that the DOJ settlement works

11

is that there is to be a sentencing hearing scheduled --

12

there is a lot of feedback.

13

from.

14
15

THE COURT:

I’m not sure where it’s coming

I can hear you clearly, but it may be

coming separately from someone.

16

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

There is a hearing on the

17

sentencing to be held not earlier than 75 days from the day

18

the Court confirms the plan.

19

confirmation order or doesn’t say anything like it.

20

says the day the Court confirms the plan.

21

(indiscernible) whether we have a shared view about that.

22

Obviously one possible date is September 1st when Your Honor

23

said I am confirming the plan and then gave us a six-and-a-

24

half-hour oral ruling.

25

September 17th, when the amended bench order and the

212-267-6868

It doesn’t say entry of the
It just

We’re talking

Another possibility is obviously

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 10
1

findings of facts and conclusions of law were entered.

2

in any event, it’s many weeks away and so I think it’s not

3

really relevant most likely for today’s purposes because

4

first, there is a sentencing and then there is another brief

5

period before the Debtors can emerge.

6

put into the DOJ settlement by the Debtors for the Debtors

7

because we need time to get ready to emerge and obviously

8

didn’t want to be sentenced until essentially the eve of

9

emergence.

10

But

That structure was

So it’s there really for our purposes, and I’m

11

sure we’ll figure out where the other -- whether it’s

12

November 22nd or I think December 8th is the alternative

13

date.

14

out here, the parties have had hours of calls and emails and

15

things like that about the right schedule for this.

16

think that there is universal agreement that we would like a

17

stay hearing if it is possible before this Court which all

18

parties are willing to agree to, most likely in the middle

19

of October.

20

evidence that came up on a call earlier today which I am

21

happy to explain, that might need to slip a little bit.

22

in any event, several to many weeks before the earliest

23

possible emergence date, which I think is far more than

24

enough time to let people have a hearing on a stay and

25

potentially further.

But in any event, just to get ahead to help everybody

212-267-6868

And I

And depending on some things that relate to

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

But

516-608-2400

Page 11
1

If it would be useful to the Court, I’m happy to

2

explain why there might be presently unknowable arbitrage in

3

the actual hearing date based on what essentially

4

(indiscernible) to a very large two-hour meet and confer we

5

had earlier today if that would be useful.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.
So, simply stated, Your Honor, but

8

for one issue, I think the core parties, and many of them

9

were on the call -- I think there were 60 people on the

10

email -- are by and large agreeable to the reply papers of

11

appellees and parties supporting the appellees being filed

12

on October 7th and then the hearing either being held

13

October 14th if that’s the date that the Court can make it,

14

or, because Mr. Eckstein is very important and without,

15

unfortunately, giving too much of a shoutout, he is just not

16

available that day, some other day very soon thereafter.

17

are not in any way, shape, or form trying to slow things

18

down.

We

We are happy to move very quickly.

19

The reason that date might not work is because the

20

movants -- and I think we got the latest stay motion only

21

very late last night from Maryland.

22

kind of coming in piecemeal on a rolling basis.

23

stay motions I believe had evidence attached to them.

24

They’re just legal briefs.

25

is a balancing of the harms, which in fact I think two of

212-267-6868

And so they’re still
One of the

But of course the stay inquiry

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 12
1

the four prongs in fact relate to facts about where the

2

harms are both from granting a stay and from not granting a

3

stay.

4

the tiny number of objectors and appellants take

5

extraordinarily strong issue with the lawyers’ claims about

6

where harm is and is not.

And suffice it to say that many parties other than

7

And so at a minimum, the Debtors, the AHC, the

8

UCC, and the MSGE all plan to have declarations attached to

9

their reply briefs providing facts for the Court to have in

10

front of it with respect to our view of harms from a stay,

11

facts that were not adduced at trial which have nothing to

12

do with harm from the timing or a delay in effectiveness,

13

but rather more about the propriety and legality of the

14

plan.

15

different motion, it’s a different legal standard, it’s a

16

different inquiry.

So this is actually a different issue.

17

It’s a

And as Your Honor has heard me say many times, at

18

the end of the day, maybe it’s simplistic, but I believe

19

that our job is to present facts that support law and lead

20

to a conclusion.

21

when we make motions, which is why the debtors invariably

22

do.

23

And I think we’re supposed to have both

And so the (indiscernible) arbitrage comes in the

24

fact that if the movants for the stay decide they don’t want

25

to depose our witnesses and they are happy to cross-examine

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 13
1

them sort of live at the hearing and they’re not putting in

2

any witnesses of their own on rebuttal, which at this point

3

(indiscernible) fairly allowed because everybody filed their

4

motions and they chose not to put in evidence, that was

5

their choice.

6

improper ambush, they should be limited to rebuttal.

7

maybe we can still proceed on the 14th.

At this point that other than I think an
Then

8

But if they say oh, wait a minute, there are now

9

going to be four or five witnesses, we want to depose them

10

all and then we want to reserve the right to put in rebuttal

11

witnesses of our own, then this turns into a factually

12

contested matter, and obviously we will need time -- you

13

know, the same seven days I assume that they got at a

14

minimum with our stuff to see what facts they have at least

15

decided to put in sometime in late October and probably

16

depose their witnesses and then have a hearing sometime

17

later.

18

So the short answer is if they want to move very

19

quickly, we’re totally game for that.

20

proceed as early on or after the 14th and as makes sense.

21

But obviously if they would like time to depose our

22

witnesses, because it’s certainly our due process and

23

constitutional right to supply facts along with our legal

24

pleadings, then obviously at their election, they are

25

welcome to slow things down.

And we’re ready to

And we have no objection to

that, either.

2

whatever way seems sensible based on what the movants want

3

to do in response to what we intend to do in our objections.

4

We are in essence happy to proceed in

Paul Schwartzberg from the U.S. Trustee’s

I also just wanted to bring the Court’s attention

Your Honor, the U.S. Trustee believes that a stay

21

is necessary to ensure an appropriate review of important

22

constitutional rights of victims by an Article 3 court.

23

as Mr. Huebner said, we do believe a hearing should go

24

forward on October 14th.

25

the stay hearing at that time.

And

We are prepared to go forward with

Your Honor.

perhaps a delaying tactic to try to get us beyond the

We believe that all the facts

We believe that perhaps the seeking of adding

And in fact, Your Honor, although Mr. Huebner
indicated that effective date could be as early as November

10

11

weeks from now, would be the date of a possible sentencing

12

hearing.

13

14

So a lot of eggs could be scrambled on the

But back to the hearing, Your Honor.

I do also

15

note that just last night we did also receive a notice of

16

deposition from one of the appellees seeking a deposition of

17

the U.S. Trustee, which we believe is also once again trying

18

to delay the matter and put us beyond the effective date.

19

But we are trying to move as expeditiously as possible.

20

In fact, we’ve received a notice of approval from

21

the Solicitor General to try to seek a direct appeal to the

22

Second Circuit in this case.

23

also think we can go on a dual track and try to deal with

24

the appeal on the merits in the district court on an

25

expedited basis.

212-267-6868

But while we’re doing that, we

Your Honor, just so the point is not

The position I talked about before is about the

MR. HUEBNER:

And that’s actually not an issue

I understand.
Okay.

I just want to make sure

there’s no confusion.

16

THE COURT:

What I’m leading up to -- and I think

17

it probably isn’t that big an issue given what I’ve just

18

heard -- is that it would seem to me that the appellants’

19

willingness, as well as the appellees’ willingness to have

20

an expedited appeal, whether it’s to the district court or a

21

direct appeal to the circuit, but in any event seeking

22

expedition, is an important factor that I’ll take into

23

account on the request for a stay.

THE COURT:

As far as the timing is concerned,

October 14th is the Purdue omnibus day for October.

It’s

not that far off.

parties don’t engage in any material discovery before that

hearing.

We can move things that are on the calendar for each of

those days to the other day.

be ready to go effective.

13

That’s well before I believe the

15

the Judge says that he is going to enter an order.

clearly is in any event, whether that more likely scenario

17

applies or the less likely one, gives parties plenty of

time, having gotten their whole record in the lower court,

there is still plenty of time to address it at a higher

MR. GOLD:

MR. GOLD:

So

But I’m not prepared to do that yet
It’s not an

Your Honor, may I be heard?
Sure.
Matthew Gold.

I recognize that Your

13

Honor’s calendar is one that I have not looked at

14

extensively, but I just wish to ask whether it’s possible

15

from the Court’s perspective that there could be a hearing

16

date the week following the 14th just because --

THE COURT:

Well, you can check with Ms. Li on

that.

19

MR. GOLD:

20

THE COURT:

Okay, thank you.
I’m giving you the dates that I

21

thought were free.

22

it’s certainly not unheard of for a bankruptcy judge, even

23

if it denies a stay or if it grants a stay, one way or the

24

other, but it would really only apply if I denied the

25

request for a stay, nevertheless to grant a sufficient stay

And given again the timing here -- and

so that the district court could decide that issue.

a feeling that that would be unnecessary here, whether it’s

the 14th or the 9th.

4

denied a stay, I would nevertheless require the Debtors for

5

example to provide notice to all the appellants several

6

days, perhaps as much as two weeks in advance of their going

8

assessment of when they would go effective is just

inaccurate.

I have

And it’s certainly the case that if I

either date.

11

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Your Honor, Paul Schwartzberg.

12

I just wanted to point out that the sentencing date, at

13

least under the Debtor’s calculation, would be just a few

14

days after the 9th.

15

THE COURT:

So -What did I just say, Mr. Schwartzberg?

16

I said that if I denied a stay, I would probably

17

nevertheless stay it so that a district court could rule.

18

would expect that at that point you would have engaged with

19

the district court, you would have gotten a timeline for

20

when that judge is free.

21

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

THE COURT:

Your Honor, let me give all parties

15

Because the thing that they’re concerned about and
Let

Our sentencing hearing is going to be a very

16

public hearing before the district court in New Jersey, of

17

which everyone in this case and many other people will get

18

clear notice.

19

exactly when our sentencing hearing is scheduled.

20

There is no question that people will know

Under the DOJ settlement agreement, we cannot

21

emerge prior to seven days after the sentencing hearing.

22

there is going to be plenty of notice and plenty of time

23

about the earliest possible confirmation date.

24

frankly, I actually don’t think that a temporary stay might

25

even be needed then.

212-267-6868

So

And,

Because if you rule on date X and our

sentencing hearing is scheduled for day Y and then it’s T

2

plus seven, that could easily be a sufficient period.

3

In any event, we’ve explained to people again and

4

again -- and it’s all in the public documents that were

5

actually approved after an extensive hearing -- the earliest

6

possible emergence dates are utterly, completely knowable

7

and known by all parties because they are keyed off of

8

another hearing in another federal court whose date will be

9

very open and public.

10

So I think there really is neither a concern that

11

the ministerial things happening before sentencing could

12

ever constitute mootness, as we’ve also told the parties

13

about a hundred times.

14

be some prized emergency.

2

to provide advanced notice as I’ve described it of an

3

effective date.

4

MR. HUEBNER:

5

THE COURT:

Thank you, Your Honor.
So, look, I think I can’t set the 14th

today because you don’t have that agreement with the

7

appellants and appellees about discovery.

In fact, it’s

16

19

And we won’t be

So I think that probably is enough for today.

20

Although I do want to say to me, given the timing here and

7

encouraged that the parties are in agreement on moving

10

The judges in this building really do

And I think certainly in this case they

And I think that’s in all likelihood the

MR. HUEBNER:

So I am

Your Honor, assuming for a minute

11

that the evidentiary issues as requested by the appellants

12

don’t delay the hearing, it sounds to me like we should

13

still be shooting for filing our briefs and declarations by

14

October 7th.

15

them at the hearing, we choose speed over a slower discovery

16

period.

17

I want to be clear about that.

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. HUEBNER:

So if people decide we’ll just cross-examine

In other words, we’re giving them the choice.

And

Right.
Obviously we need to have our briefs

20

so we can go forward with the hearing to have that be fair.

21

So we’re still willing I think to be held until October 7th.

22

THE COURT:

That’s fine.

A week in advance of the

23

hearing with three days before the hearing for reply briefs,

24

that’s fine.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Right.

But I should just ask, because

Veritext Legal Solutions

1

I’m very nervous, as I’m normally not a litigator, I’m

2

certainly not an appellant litigator.

3

the UCC, the AHC, the MSGE, or the PIs if I have sort of

4

gotten something wrong or if there is some other deadline.

5

Because, for example, the fact that we’re still getting new

6

stay motions right now -- obviously we got one very late

7

last night.

8

this, if this calendar holds, that we want to make sure that

9

we sort of lay out right now so we’re not surprised by

And if I could ask

Are there any other deadlines that as part of

10

filings.

11

parties on sort of our side of the V as it were, to please

12

jump in if I’ve missed something that’s important that we

13

all agree and lock down publicly and firmly on the record.

14

Mr. Shore and Mr. Preis, Mr. Maclay, Mr. Eckstein, please

15

supplement if I’ve gotten something not complete.

16
17

So I would ask someone from one of the other

MR. PREIS:

Your Honor, this is Arik Preis with

Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &

Feld.

Can you hear me?

18

THE COURT:

Yes.

Fine, thanks.

19

MR. PREIS:

Good afternoon.

I did want to ask one

20

question.

Because you correctly pointed out at the

21

beginning that there are motion or motions to come seeking a

22

stay.

23

this hearing on October 14th or November 9th, how does the

24

Court (indiscernible) deal with the late (indiscernible) who

25

are appealing today, but then they make final their motion

Given that and given that you’re either going to have

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 28
1

for stay next week?

2

THE COURT:

How do we deal with that?
Right.

Well, I think they have to fit

3

into the same schedule.

It’s a good question, but I think

4

they have to fit into the same schedule.

5

waited -- they will have waited obviously until the last day

6

to file an appeal and the 14-day stay will have passed then.

7

Because of that choice, I think they really need to be

8

prepared, and they’ve had time to be prepared to make a stay

9

motion.

I mean, look, they

And they’ll just have to fit into the schedule that

10

is adopted.

11

everyone else that they don’t need discovery on your

12

witnesses.

13

motion say on October 3rd or whenever, you know, before the

14

hearing.

15

And that includes if there is an agreement by

That would apply to someone who files a stay

MR. PREIS:

Well, that’s understood.

And I

16

appreciate that.

17

would come in October 7th.

18

something that comes in October 7th if it comes in

19

(indiscernible).

20

But Mr. Huebner just said our replies

THE COURT:

We can’t very well reply to

Well, I guess that’s fair.

On the

21

other hand, there are plenty of motions for stays pending

22

appeal where it’s just heard orally by the judge.

23

think, look, I think the issues on appeal are going to be

24

pretty standard.

25

something that really comes in from left field and it’s not

212-267-6868

So I’m not bothered by that.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And I

If there’s

516-608-2400

Page 29
1

some that you can dispose of easily at oral argument, then

2

maybe I’ll hear that a couple days later.

3

to suggest that that would happen because I don’t think it

4

will.

5

MR. PREIS:

But I don’t want

Is there a way -- I take your point.

6

But is there any way to set a deadline for motions for stay

7

pending appeal (indiscernible) on October 15th?

8
9

THE COURT:

I think the deadline is just the fact

that they have to be ready for the hearing then.

And I

10

appreciate that puts some pressure on you, but I think the

11

allies of the appellee debtor are up to him on that.

12

MR. PREIS:

Okay.

13

THE COURT:

Again, with the caveat if something

14

truly comes out of left field that isn’t bizarrely out of

15

left field -- and I think it would be unfair to give you

16

just a day or so to respond, then I may hear that particular

17

issue later.

18

MR. PREIS:

Okay.

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

20

MR. ECKSTEIN:

21

Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, good afternoon.

It’s

Kenneth Eckstein of Kramer Levin, if I can briefly be heard.

22

THE COURT:

Sure.

23

MR. ECKSTEIN:

First, as Mr. Huebner indicated,

24

from a personal standpoint, I would prefer the 9th.

25

the hearing needs to go forward on October 14th, my

But if

2

I actually do believe that November 9th is a more organized

3

date to do this because (indiscernible) pleadings on the

4

5

We do intend to put in declarations (indiscernible)

9
10

I happen agree with Your Honor, between now and
the effective date, we don’t see the urgency because
(indiscernible) a couple of weeks.

11
12

THE COURT:

Well, the urgency is getting it in

front of the appellate court.

13

MR. ECKSTEIN:

That’s the urgency.

Right.

And I recognize that.

And

14

I think that we’re all willing to work to make sure that

15

that gets accomplished.

16

But in any event, it’s a bit I think disjointed if

17

we’re going to find out two days in advance of the court

18

date that there’s either going to need to be depositions or

19

there’s going to be rebuttal witnesses or if there’s even

20

going to be cross-examination and the like.

21

compels in favor of a more organized date.

22

we will work with either and we’ll be prepared

23

(indiscernible) to put in a pleading and a declaration in

24

opposition to a post effective date (indiscernible).

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Okay.

So that to me
But as I said,

I mean, coming into this

conference, it seemed to me that November 9th might be also

a more organized date for all of this.

on this.

case, someone on some side will be unhappy with my ruling

8

about a stay.

9

speed on the underlying issues might be helpful when they

But if the parties

One benefit of doing it on the 9th is that you do

And just based on the nature of this chapter 11

And having the appellate court be more up to

hear a request for a stay, or more likely, an appeal from my

ruling on the stay.

12

mind too as far as picking a date

13

MR. ECKSTEIN:

So I’d like the parties to keep that in

I think that is (indiscernible),

14

Your Honor.

15

significantly, there’s no question.

16

And I think that they’re going to overlap quite

THE COURT:

Right.

I mean, look, I think one of

17

the reasons that the law on equitable mootness is so diverse

18

throughout the country and even within circuits is because

19

there are times when an appellate court just wants to rule.

20

You know?

21

needs to be addressed in the lower court’s order, and

22

they’re going to find a way to do it.

23

really don’t want to rule.

24

instead of affirming or reversing, simply say it’s moot.

25

The more that the appellate court is informed, the better as

212-267-6868

They want to address something that they see that

And other times, they

And sometimes, therefore,

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 32

far as the consideration of these types of issues at that

2

level.

3

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:
I apologize.

Your Honor, Paul Schwartzberg

4

again.

5

whether it be the 14th or the 9th, should we just contact

6

chambers?

7

THE COURT:

When the parties coalesce on a date,

Yes.

Again, yes, definitely.

And in

8

the meantime, we won’t add anything to either the 9th or the

9

10th.

So you can coalesce on that date.

And in the

10

meantime of course we have the 14th because it’s a Purdue

11

omnibus day.

12

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

13

THE COURT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

But in each case, any objections to

14

the stay motions would be due a week in advance unless

15

someone files a stay motion.

16

that -- you know, someone else other than the people here.

17

And any replies three days before the hearing.

18

reiterate what I told Mr. Preis, but that’s also applicable.

19

Mr. Fogelman --

20

MR. HUEBNER:

21

Honor.

22
23

25

And I won’t

Your Honor, one -- I’m sorry, Your

I apologize.
THE COURT:

Mr. Fogelman, I think you’ve been

trying to say something.

24

You know, but you can’t do

MR. FOGELMAN:

Or maybe not.
Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

I

just wanted to address the point that Mr. Huebner raised

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 33
1

before when he said the issue of whether the Debtor

2

(indiscernible) or not, it’s not before the Court today.

3

While that may literally true on the calendar, it’s clear

4

today that all appellants have expressed a willingness to

5

brief the merits on an expedited schedule and

6

(indiscernible) direct certification to the Second Circuit.

7

Frankly, Your Honor, it makes sense for the Second

8

Circuit to have the opportunity to review these important

9

issues before the plan goes effective.

And in order to

10

facilitate the process, it would be helpful to hear from the

11

Debtors as quickly as possible regarding whether they

12

consent to (indiscernible) certification as they are the

13

only appellee here, that they agree to certification

14

(indiscernible) have the right to go to the Second Circuit

15

on petition without further action of the bankruptcy court.

16

And I think it makes sense first to determine

17

(indiscernible) briefing schedule as soon as possible and

18

well in advance (indiscernible).

19

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

THE COURT:

21

That’s a fair point.

I’m sure the

parties are focusing on that, and that’s important.

22

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, two quick points.

23

One thing I realize may not have been what the Court

24

intended, which is I don’t think it would be remotely fair -

25

- and I hope it’s not what anybody intended -- that we file

good with November 9th and we’re not filing anything for a

3

month until November 6th, including witness declarations --

4

THE COURT:

No, no.

You should work it -- well

5

before the briefs, well before the objections are filed, the

6

parties need to work out whether it’s the 14th or the 9th.

7

MR. HUEBNER:

Exactly.

And I assume that we’ll

8

have a different schedule if there are going to be

9

evidentiary submissions by the appellants, which would be

10

well before three days before the hearing in November.

11

THE COURT:

The best way to describe it is it

12

should be -- any replies are three days before the hearing

13

and any briefs are seven days before the hearing, whichever

14

hearing it’s going to be, the 14th or the 9th.

15
16

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

So we’ll figure that out in a

way that’s fair.

17

With respect to Mr. Fogelman’s point, I just want

18

to note it’s a little bit bizarre that Department of Justice

19

itself filed the first (indiscernible) of appeal, it listed

20

both sides of the Sackler families as appellees.

21

it’s a little bit strategic to say the least because they

22

did not list all the other plan supporters who actually in

in fact I think are the actual appellees.

It’s ultimately for the appellate

And, frankly, this

sort of jockeying before the trial court, including who the

2

appellees are, is (indiscernible).

3

Fogelman on behalf of the DOJ saying the only appellees are

4

the debtor while another part of the DOJ listed only the

5

debtors and the Sacklers, truly could create a terrible

6

misimpression up above that this is the Debtors and the

7

Sacklers versus the U.S. Government, when as everybody

8

knows, the Sacklers did not vote on the plan, did not draft

9

the plan, did not see the plan until it was public.

But again, to have Mr.

Rather,

10

this is the creditors’ and the stakeholders’ plan.

11

Your Honor, I think that many of our core constituencies

12

absolutely positively and passionately believe that they are

13

appellees, and I think they will be seeking to be made

14

appellees.

15

conversations are going on about right now.

And,

And those are the kinds of things that lots of

5

6

THE COURT:

We’re working as quickly as we can

But I think that -- okay, fine.

7

Although that’s really more of an issue for the appellate

8

court, including identifying who they need to check into and

9

make sure that they are aware of their interests in the

10

case.

11

But as far as the decision on whether they agree

12

to a direct appeal or not, that really should be made

13

promptly.

14

substantial amount of work for one of the judges in this

building.

Ironically, we actually think we can get to a much

22

faster hearing on the merits before the district court

23

because it saves probably two rounds of briefing before the

merits.

Just to raise the related topic that

we’ve all been discussing partially.

agreement, as I said before, that we should be moving

2

promptly to try to get a certification, but I would request

3

to the Court that perhaps we can also -- if Your Honor is

4

agreeable, file a formal motion to be heard on the 14th so

5

that if the parties are still having a discussion, it

So we are trying to be

We just want to be able to move that

THE COURT:

I haven’t really looked at that issue.

15

I know there is a scheduling order in place in the case

16

which might require you to file the motion by tomorrow.

17

think if you file it within a reasonable time, I would be

18

willing to modify that order so that it could be heard on

19

the 14th.

20

although it’s based on looking at these issues several years

21

ago, is that ultimately it’s up to the Second Circuit

22

whether they take it or not.

On the other hand, my distinct impression,

23

MR. GOLD:

necessarily that important.

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, we’re happy to look

at that just so that we’re all clear (indiscernible).

not believe I was on any call where anyone said you haven’t

7

THE COURT:

Well, it doesn’t matter.

I do

I mean, Mr.

8

Gold has a legitimate concern that under the scheduling

9

order in the case generally if he doesn’t file it by

10

tomorrow, someone -- not necessarily you -- may raise their

11

hand and say, well, it’s too late for the judge to hear it

12

on the 14th.

13

the 14th, Mr. Gold, I will probably hear it.

14

If you file it within a reasonable time before

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah.

And, Your Honor, that’s where

15

I was going to go next, which is, like everything else we

16

keep saying, we actually believe in due process.

people need to make a motion to protect their rights, we

That’s fair.

I don’t see why people

10

need to be flat-out rushing to get briefs in if they can

11

reach consensus, you know, by end of the day Tuesday.

12

That’s fair.

13

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah.

And then if it’s the 9th,

14

we’ll just try to agree on an appropriate briefing schedule

15

if they’re going to be putting in witnesses and declaration

16

and discovery, it then becomes a contested evidentiary

17

matter, and presumably we should be able to be on a schedule

18

cruising towards the 9th.

thought?

it’s just to help perhaps guide all the parties’ thinking on

The

idea is I would like to accommodate those who believe -- and

close to the sweet spot where at least you can reasonably

predict that there will be appellate review by date X, I

think you might well consider coming together on an order
