Ross Geller: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Joey Tribbiani: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Phoebe Buffay: Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Chandler Bing: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Ross Geller: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Rachel Green: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
Monica Geller: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Rachel Green: Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
