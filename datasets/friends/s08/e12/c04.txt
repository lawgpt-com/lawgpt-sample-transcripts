Rachel Green: Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Joey Tribbiani: No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Rachel Green: Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani: And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so...
Rachel Green: Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Rachel Green: Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
Joey Tribbiani: I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Rachel Green: Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?
Rachel Green: Hm-mmm.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Rachel Green: Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
