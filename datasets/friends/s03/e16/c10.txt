Ross Geller: Chloe? Hi..
Chloe: Is this about me taking your watch?
Ross Geller: You took my watch?
Chloe: I'm sorry, I do that.
Ross Geller: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Chloe: Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Ross Geller: Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Chloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Ross Geller: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Issac: You dog!
Ross Geller: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Issac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Ross Geller: Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Issac: Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Ross Geller: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Issac: Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
Ross Geller: Actually, no, we're not.
Issac: Yeah, we are.
Ross Geller: No, we're not.
Issac: Yeah, we are.
Ross Geller: No, we're not!!
Issac: Okay, we're not.
Ross Geller: Right.
Issac: But, we are.
Ross Geller: Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Issac: I can promise not to tell her again.
