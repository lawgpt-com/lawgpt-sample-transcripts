Monica Geller: Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Ross Geller: All right. I think it was a mouse.

Jack Geller: How are you honey?
Monica Geller: How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!

Jack Geller: Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
Monica Geller: What's this?
Jack Geller: It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Monica Geller: What?!
Ross Geller: What?!!!
Jack Geller: I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
Monica Geller: Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Ross Geller: Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Jack Geller: Why don't we take it for a spin?
Monica Geller: All right!
Ross Geller: Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
