Phoebe Buffay: We're back!
Charity Guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
Mike Hannigan: No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
Phoebe Buffay: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!
Charity Guy: If I haven't said so already sir, congratulations!
Mike Hannigan: Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?
Charity Guy: You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
Mike Hannigan: What?
Charity Guy: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
Phoebe Buffay: But... but... but we're giving you this!
Charity Guy: Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, this is very generous!
Charity Guy: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
Mike Hannigan: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Charity Guy: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, is that you?
Charity Guy: No!
