Ross Geller: Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Chandler Bing: Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Ross Geller: Sure, do whatever you want.

Monica Geller: Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Monica Geller: Look at this.
Ross Geller: Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Phoebe Buffay: What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Monica Geller: I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Ross Geller: I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
Phoebe Buffay: I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!

Ross Geller: Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Chandler Bing: Sorry!
