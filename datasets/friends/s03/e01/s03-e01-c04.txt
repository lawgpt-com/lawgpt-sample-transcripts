Monica Geller: God, look what I found in the drain.
Rachel Green: What?!
Monica Geller: It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Ross Geller: Getting it away from me would be job one.
Monica Geller: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Monica Geller: God, what is wrong with me.
Ross Geller: You need to get some sleep.
Monica Geller: I need to get some Richard.
Rachel Green: Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Monica Geller: I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe, because you told him not to.
Monica Geller: What are you the memory woman?
Joey Tribbiani: Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Rachel Green: Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Joey Tribbiani: Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Rachel Green: Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Joey Tribbiani: There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross Geller: Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
