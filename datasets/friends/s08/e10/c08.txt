Chandler Bing: Y'know, that party wasn't bad.
Monica Geller: Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
Chandler Bing: I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Monica Geller: Oh no, we can't walk!
Chandler Bing: What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
Monica Geller: Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Chandler Bing: What's going on?
Monica Geller: I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
Chandler Bing: So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
Monica Geller: How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Chandler Bing: Hop on.
Monica Geller: Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...
Chandler Bing: Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
