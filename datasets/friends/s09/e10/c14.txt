Monica Geller: Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Chandler Bing: Ehh.
Monica Geller: Eh, you work for that.
Chandler Bing: Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica Geller: You do?!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Monica Geller: Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Chandler Bing: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica Geller: You thought about that?
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Monica Geller: How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler Bing: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Monica Geller: What else did you think about?
Chandler Bing: Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Monica Geller: Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Chandler Bing: Sure you do.
Monica Geller: No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler Bing: You sure?
Monica Geller: Uh-hmm.
Chandler Bing: I love you so much.
Monica Geller: I love you.
