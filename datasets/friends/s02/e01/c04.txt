Rachel Green: Did you talk to him?
Chandler Bing: Not yet.
Rachel Green: Then, no.
Chandler Bing: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Ross Geller: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Chandler Bing: God?
Ross Geller: It was you, pal.
Chandler Bing: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Ross Geller: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Chandler Bing: Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Rachel Green: Here's your lemonade.
Ross Geller: I didn't order lemonade.
Rachel Green: Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.

Chandler Bing: He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
Rachel Green: How is that the silver lining?
Chandler Bing: You have to really wanna see it.
