Phoebe Buffay: Ooh Monica!
Monica Geller: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
Monica Geller: I...I have to fire him.
Phoebe Buffay: But why?!
Monica Geller: Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Phoebe Buffay: Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Monica Geller: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
Phoebe Buffay: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Monica Geller: All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
Phoebe Buffay: That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Monica Geller: I paid to have this done.
Phoebe Buffay: Love it!
