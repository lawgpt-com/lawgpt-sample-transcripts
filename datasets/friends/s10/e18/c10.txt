Rachel Green: Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
Ross Geller: Oh my God!
Rachel Green: Excuse me?
Air Stewardess: Miss? Please, sit down!
Rachel Green: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Air Stewardess: Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Ross Geller: Let her off the plane!
Air Stewardess: I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
Rachel Green: Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
Ross Geller: Try to understand!
Rachel Green: Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
Ross Geller: No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
Rachel Green: I got off the plane.
Ross Geller: You got off the plane.
Rachel Green: I do love you.
Ross Geller: I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Rachel Green: Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Ross Geller: Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Rachel Green: Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
Ross Geller: This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Ross Geller: Don't make jokes now.
