Joey Tribbiani: PBS Telethon.
Phoebe Buffay: Hi Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Joey Tribbiani: $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Joey Tribbiani: And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Phoebe Buffay: No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Joey Tribbiani: A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Gary Collins: It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
