Phoebe Buffay: I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.

Chandler Bing: Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Mike Hannigan: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
Mike Hannigan: Yes dear.

Phoebe Buffay: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Ross Geller: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Phoebe Buffay: I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
Mike Hannigan: You ready to go?
