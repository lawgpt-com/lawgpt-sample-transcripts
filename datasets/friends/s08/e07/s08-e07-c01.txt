Monica Geller: Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Chandler Bing: Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
Monica Geller: Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Chandler Bing: No, it wasn't you.
Monica Geller: Well then who?
Chandler Bing: I got a maid. Yay!
Monica Geller: I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...
Chandler Bing: Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...
Monica Geller: Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Chandler Bing: Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Monica Geller: Did she really say that?
Chandler Bing: Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
Monica Geller: Fine, I can do it. Whew.
Chandler Bing: What's the matter?
Monica Geller: Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
