Phoebe Buffay: Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
Monica Geller: Oh, my!
Rachel Green: Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
Monica Geller: I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Rachel Green: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
Monica Geller: I like that poster!
Phoebe Buffay: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Rachel Green: Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Monica Geller: Are you still here?
