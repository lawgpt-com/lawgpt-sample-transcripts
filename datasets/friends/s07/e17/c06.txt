Chandler Bing: So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?

Ross Geller: Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Chandler!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Chandler Bing: Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Joey Tribbiani: Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!

Ross Geller: Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Chandler Bing: Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Ross Geller: Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Chandler Bing: So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Joey Tribbiani: Kristen Lang.
Chandler Bing: Bye!
