Charlie Wheeler: Thanks!
Ross Geller: Hi.
Charlie Wheeler: Are they still looking for us?
Ross Geller: Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Ross Geller: I don't think they saw us.
Charlie Wheeler: I don't think they did.
Charlie Wheeler: Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
Ross Geller: Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Charlie Wheeler: I think you know.
Ross Geller: I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Ross Geller: I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Charlie Wheeler: All right, all right.
Ross Geller: I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
