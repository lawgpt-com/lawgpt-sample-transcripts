Joey Tribbiani: Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Ross Geller: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Monica Geller: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Ross Geller: Must pee.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Rachel Green: You're twins?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Chandler Bing: What does she do?
Phoebe Buffay: She's a waitress.
Rachel Green: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Monica Geller: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Chandler Bing: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Rachel Green: The lights, please..
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: ...How long was I in there?
Rachel Green: I'm just cleaning up.
Ross Geller: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Rachel Green: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Ross Geller: Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Rachel Green: Oh.. a little..
Ross Geller: Mm-hmm..
Rachel Green: A lot.
Ross Geller: Mm.
Rachel Green: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Ross Geller: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Rachel Green: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Ross Geller: Got me.
Rachel Green: Remember when we were in high school together?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Ross Geller: Yes, yes!
Rachel Green: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Ross Geller: Me either...
