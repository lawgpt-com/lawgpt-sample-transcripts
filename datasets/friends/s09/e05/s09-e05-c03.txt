Phoebe Buffay: Trick or treat!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, and treat it is.
Monica Geller: Hmhmm.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
Monica Geller: This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
Monica Geller: Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
Phoebe Buffay: 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Chandler Bing: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Phoebe Buffay: You smoked!

Phoebe Buffay: Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Chandler Bing: Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Phoebe Buffay: Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Chandler Bing: Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm gonna go.
Chandler Bing: Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
Monica Geller: Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Chandler Bing: No thanks, I'm good.
Monica Geller: O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Chandler Bing: Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Monica Geller: You don't need a shower.
Chandler Bing: Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Monica Geller: What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
Chandler Bing: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
Monica Geller: nan
Chandler Bing: But, those are for you.
