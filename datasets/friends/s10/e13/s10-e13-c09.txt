Ross Geller: Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Rachel Green: Sure.
Ross Geller: You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Rachel Green: Hmm-hmm.
Ross Geller: You sure you're alright?
Rachel Green: Yep.
Ross Geller: O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
Rachel Green: FYI..
Ross Geller: There it is...
Rachel Green: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Ross Geller: Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Rachel Green: Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Ross Geller: Well...
Rachel Green: Oh stop that!
Ross Geller: I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Rachel Green: Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Ross Geller: Hey, I was looking out for you.
Rachel Green: Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Ross Geller: I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Rachel Green: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Ross Geller: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
