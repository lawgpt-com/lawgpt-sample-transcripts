Phoebe Buffay: Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Monica Geller: Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Rachel Green: You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Phoebe Buffay: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Rachel Green: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Monica Geller: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Ross Geller: Hiii.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no, what happened?
Ross Geller: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.

Rachel Green: Well I've had it.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I've had it.
Monica Geller: Had it.
Chandler Bing: Had it.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
