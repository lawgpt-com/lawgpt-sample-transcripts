Monica Geller: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Rachel Green: What's that?
Monica Geller: Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Rachel Green: Okay.
Monica Geller: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Monica Geller: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Rachel Green: Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Monica Geller: Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Rachel Green: But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Monica Geller: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Rachel Green: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Monica Geller: Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Rachel Green: Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
