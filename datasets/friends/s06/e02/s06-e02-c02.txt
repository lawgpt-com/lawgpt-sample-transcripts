Chandler Bing: Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Monica Geller: Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Chandler Bing: No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Monica Geller: Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Chandler Bing: No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Monica Geller: Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Chandler Bing: Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Monica Geller: Pretty much.
Chandler Bing: All right.

Monica Geller: Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Chandler Bing: Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
