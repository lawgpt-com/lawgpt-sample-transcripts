Joey Tribbiani: Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Phoebe Buffay: Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Joey Tribbiani: Then don't go!
Phoebe Buffay: Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Phoebe Buffay: You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
