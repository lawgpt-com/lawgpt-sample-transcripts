Phoebe Buffay: Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Joey Tribbiani: Thursday? But that's Halloween.
Phoebe Buffay: So?
Joey Tribbiani: So spooky, that's all.
Ross Geller: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
Phoebe Buffay: No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
Rachel Green: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Rachel!
Ross Geller: Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yay!
Ross Geller: Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Phoebe Buffay: Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
Monica Geller: What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Rachel Green: Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
Monica Geller: Oh, dear god!
