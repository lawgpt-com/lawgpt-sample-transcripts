Joey Tribbiani: Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Chandler Bing: For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Rachel Green: Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Chandler Bing: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Rachel Green: No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Chandler Bing: No, because you're not a grandmother!
Rachel Green: No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Monica Geller: All you had to do was buy the card!
