Housekeeper: The Waltham Residence.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Housekeeper: This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you saying?!
Housekeeper: Now, let us try that again, shall we?
unknown: nan
Phoebe Buffay: No! Ooh! Oh my god!
Housekeeper: The Waltham Residence.
Phoebe Buffay: Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Housekeeper: Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Phoebe Buffay: No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Housekeeper: I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Housekeeper: Hangs up.
Phoebe Buffay: Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
