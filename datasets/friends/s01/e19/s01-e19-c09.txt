Monica Geller: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Phoebe Buffay: Nope.
Monica Geller: That's because I'm in front of them.
Chandler Bing: Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Monica Geller: Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Joey Tribbiani: I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.

Monica Geller: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
