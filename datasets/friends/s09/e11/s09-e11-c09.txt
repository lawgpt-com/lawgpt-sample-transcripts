Rachel Green: Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Ross Geller: What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Rachel Green: Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
Ross Geller: What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Rachel Green: I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
Ross Geller: Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Rachel Green: Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Ross Geller: Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
Rachel Green: Ross?
Ross Geller: Huh?
Rachel Green: You're pretty.
