Casey: Here you go.
Joey Tribbiani: Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Casey: Great!
Chandler Bing: Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey Tribbiani: That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Chandler Bing: Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Joey Tribbiani: No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Chandler Bing: Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler Bing: Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Joey Tribbiani: What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Chandler Bing: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Joey Tribbiani: You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler Bing: All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Joey Tribbiani: Who's Elaine?
