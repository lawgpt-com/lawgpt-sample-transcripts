Chandler Bing: Hey!
Ross Geller: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Chandler Bing: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Ross Geller: OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Chandler Bing: No!
Ross Geller: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Chandler Bing: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
Ross Geller: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Chandler Bing: So are you gonna...talk to her?
Ross Geller: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
Chandler Bing: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
Ross Geller: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
Chandler Bing: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Ross Geller: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Chandler Bing: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Ross Geller: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
Chandler Bing: Why did I get married?!
