Ross Geller: C'mon.
Rachel Green: Joey.
Ross Geller: Open up. We want to talk to you.
Joey Tribbiani: I don't feel like talkin.
Rachel Green: Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
Chandler Bing: We're worried about you.
Monica Geller: And some of us really have to pee.
Monica Geller: Sorry Joey
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Chandler Bing: We came over as soon as we saw.
Ross Geller: How could you not tell us?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Rachel Green: Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Joey Tribbiani: Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Phoebe Buffay: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Joey Tribbiani: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Monica Geller: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Chandler Bing: It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Joey Tribbiani: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry man.
Rachel Green: Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Joey Tribbiani: No, that means nothin to me.
