Joey Tribbiani: Hey Rach.
Rachel Green: Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Rachel Green: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Rachel Green: Well no, I don't smell anything.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Ross Geller: Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Rachel Green: Nothing!
Ross Geller: Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Rachel Green: Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Ross Geller: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Rachel Green: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Ross Geller: Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Phoebe Buffay: Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Ross Geller: Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Phoebe Buffay: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ross Geller: I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Phoebe Buffay: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Ross Geller: Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Ross Geller: Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Ross Geller: He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Ross Geller: His daughter was hot.
Joey Tribbiani: Gotcha.
