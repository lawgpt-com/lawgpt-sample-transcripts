Chandler Bing: Oh my God.
Ross Geller: You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Chandler Bing: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ross Geller: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Chandler Bing: What?
Ross Geller: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Chandler Bing: You knew about this?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Chandler Bing: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Ross Geller: Thanks, man, big help.
Chandler Bing: I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Ross Geller: I wasn't- I mean, I-
Chandler Bing: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Ross Geller: I know-
Chandler Bing: I can't believe you did this.
Ross Geller: Chandler-
Joey Tribbiani: Me neither, y'know what-
Chandler Bing: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Joey Tribbiani: What are you mad at me for?!
Ross Geller: Chandler-
Chandler Bing: You gotta let me slam the door!
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Ross Geller: Joey-
Joey Tribbiani: Ah! Huh?
