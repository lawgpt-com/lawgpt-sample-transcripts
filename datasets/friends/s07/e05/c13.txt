Phoebe Buffay: Hi.
Ross Geller: Hi.
Phoebe Buffay: So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Ross Geller: Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Ross Geller: Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Phoebe Buffay: You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Ross Geller: I think he can be.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Ross Geller: Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Ross Geller: I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Phoebe Buffay: We want the last six years back!!
Ross Geller: So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
