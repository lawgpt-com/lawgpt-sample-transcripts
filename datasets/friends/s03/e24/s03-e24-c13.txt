Peter Becker: It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Monica Geller: Please tell me you're stopping now.
Peter Becker: I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Monica Geller: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Peter Becker: I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Monica Geller: Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Peter Becker: Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Monica Geller: Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Peter Becker: Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Monica Geller: Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Peter Becker: Mon-Monica?
Monica Geller: Yes?
Peter Becker: Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
