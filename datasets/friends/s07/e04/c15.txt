Rachel Green: Hi!
Tag Jones: Do you have a minute?
Rachel Green: Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Tag Jones: I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Rachel Green: Oh really?!
Tag Jones: Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Rachel Green: Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Tag Jones: But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Rachel Green: Why's that?
Tag Jones: I don't think I should say.
Rachel Green: Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Tag Jones: Okay.
Rachel Green: 'Kay.
Tag Jones: Well...
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Tag Jones: I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Rachel Green: Yeah, she's gay.
