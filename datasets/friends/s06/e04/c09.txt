Chandler Bing: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Joey Tribbiani: Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Chandler Bing: I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.

Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: What's going on?
Chandler Bing: Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Joey Tribbiani: Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Joey Tribbiani: Sure, now I'm scared.
Phoebe Buffay: No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Phoebe Buffay: No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
