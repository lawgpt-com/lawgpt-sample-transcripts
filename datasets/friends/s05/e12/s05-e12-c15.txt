Ross Geller: Dude, we got to talk.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Ross Geller: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Chandler Bing: Why would I be mad?
Ross Geller: Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Chandler Bing: I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Ross Geller: Okay.
Chandler Bing: I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Ross Geller: All right.
Chandler Bing: And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
