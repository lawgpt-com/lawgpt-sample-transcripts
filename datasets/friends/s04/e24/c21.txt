Monica Geller: You really think this is okay?
Chandler Bing: Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Monica Geller: Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Chandler Bing: Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Monica Geller: Okay!
Chandler Bing: Okay!

Ross Geller: Emily?!
Chandler Bing: Nope, not under here!
Monica Geller: You didn't find her?
Ross Geller: No, I've looked everywhere!
Chandler Bing: Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Monica Geller: Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Monica Geller: Or 45.
Chandler Bing: Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Ross Geller: No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Monica Geller: Well, it's getting late.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, we're gonna go.
Ross Geller: Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Monica Geller: Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Ross Geller: That's cool.
Chandler Bing: But, we'll stay here with you.
Ross Geller: Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
