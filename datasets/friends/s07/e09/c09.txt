Ross Geller: Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Phoebe Buffay: Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Ross Geller: Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Phoebe Buffay: Why? Why do I have to learn?
Ross Geller: Well...In-in case of emergency.
Phoebe Buffay: What kind of an emergency?
Ross Geller: Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Ross Geller: Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Phoebe Buffay: You won't let go?
Ross Geller: No!
Phoebe Buffay: Swear?!
Ross Geller: I swear!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Ross Geller: Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
Phoebe Buffay: All right.
Ross Geller: All right. Feel good?
Phoebe Buffay: Well...
Ross Geller: All right, try pedaling.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Ross Geller: That's it, your doing great.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Ross Geller: Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Phoebe Buffay: Weee!!!
Ross Geller: Yes!! Yes!!!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Ross Geller: I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Phoebe Buffay: I am shocked! Shocked!!
Ross Geller: It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
