Doug: But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
Kara: So how do you kids like your coffee?
Monica Geller: Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Chandler Bing: Just a little bit of sugar.
Doug: Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?

Monica Geller: How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Chandler Bing: Oh, you get used to it.
Monica Geller: Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Chandler Bing: So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Monica Geller: I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Chandler Bing: Oh.
Doug: Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Chandler Bing: What?
Doug: The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Chandler Bing: Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Doug: Excuse me?
Chandler Bing: Well, I just...
Monica Geller: Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Chandler Bing: Really?
Monica Geller: Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Chandler Bing: I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Monica Geller: I thought you could use the help.
Chandler Bing: Coffee in a fight!
