The Doctor: Hi Rachel!
Rachel Green: Hey!
The Doctor: I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Rachel Green: So were done then!
Dr. Miller: Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Dr. Miller: This is a glaucoma test.
Rachel Green: Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller: Sit down.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Dr. Miller: But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Rachel Green: What?!
Monica Geller: A small puff of air, now come on!
Dr. Miller: Here we go.
Rachel Green: All right.
Dr. Miller: 1...2...3!
Rachel Green: I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
Dr. Miller: Ready?
Rachel Green: Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller: 1...2...
Monica Geller: Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Dr. Miller: That's okay.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Rachel Green: Okay. Okay!
Dr. Miller: 1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Rachel Green: Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Dr. Miller: Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Rachel Green: Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Dr. Miller: Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Rachel Green: Great!
Dr. Miller: And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Rachel Green: Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Monica Geller: Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Dr. Miller: Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Monica Geller: I sure do! And you don't get one!
