Monica Geller: Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Ross Geller: What-why?
Monica Geller: Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.

Chandler Bing: I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.

Monica Geller: She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler Bing: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Monica Geller: Wafer thin ice!
