Zack: Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks!
Chandler Bing: So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Monica Geller: Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Chandler Bing: You don't like him.
Monica Geller: I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Chandler Bing: Alright! Just follow my lead!
Zack: You guys have such a great place here.
Chandler Bing: Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Zack: Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
Chandler Bing: That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Zack: Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Monica Geller: Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Zack: No...
Monica Geller: Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Zack: You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
Monica Geller: We're just making conversation.
Zack: Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Chandler Bing: You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
Zack: Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Chandler Bing: Sure! Alright...
Zack: Ravioli's delicious!
Chandler Bing: I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Zack: No I didn't.
Monica Geller: Yess!!
Chandler Bing: We're teeth people Zack!
