Joey Tribbiani: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!

Krista: Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Danny: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Krista: Here, I'll get it.
Krista: We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Danny: Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Rachel Green: Oh, great!
