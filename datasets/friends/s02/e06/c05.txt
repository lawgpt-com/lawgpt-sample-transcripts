Rachel Green: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hi.
Rachel Green: Here. I thought you might be cold.
Phoebe Buffay: Thank you.
Rachel Green: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Phoebe Buffay: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Rachel Green: Do you?
Phoebe Buffay: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Rachel Green: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Phoebe Buffay: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Rachel Green: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Phoebe Buffay: Really? From who?
Rachel Green: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Kid: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Here you go.
Kid: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
