Ross Geller: Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica Geller: Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler Bing: I kissed Kathy.
Ross Geller: What?
Monica Geller: Are you serious?
Phoebe Buffay: Does Joey know?
Chandler Bing: No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Monica Geller: You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Ross Geller: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
Chandler Bing: Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Phoebe Buffay: I think maybe, yeah.
Monica Geller: He loves you.
Chandler Bing: Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Ross Geller: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Rachel Green: I know, I remember that!
Monica Geller: I remember you did.
Chandler Bing: God!! What am I gonna do?!
Rachel Green: Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Chandler Bing: Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel Green: Because you do.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I know.
Ross Geller: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
