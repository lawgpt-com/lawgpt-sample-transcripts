Rachel Green: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Monica Geller: Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you doing?
Monica Geller: Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Rachel Green: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Monica Geller: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Rachel Green: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Phoebe Buffay: This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
