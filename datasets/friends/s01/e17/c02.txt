Ross Geller: I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Chandler Bing: That's nice.
Ross Geller: No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Joey Tribbiani: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Ross Geller: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Chandler Bing: What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Joey Tribbiani: He should take the sack?
Ross Geller: Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.

Joey Tribbiani: Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Chandler Bing: Well, only if you order stuff.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Ross Geller: Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Joey Tribbiani: When's that?
Ross Geller: Tonight.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: You take your time.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani: What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Chandler Bing: And your friend Phoebe?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Chandler Bing: Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
