Mr. Treeger: Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Mr. Treeger: And tell him what?
Joey Tribbiani: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Mr. Treeger: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
Joey Tribbiani: I have actually not heard of that.
Mr. Treeger: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Joey Tribbiani: Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
