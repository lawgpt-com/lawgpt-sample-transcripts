Rachel Green: Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Mr. Burgin: Hi.
Rachel Green: Hello.
Mrs. Burgin: Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Rachel Green: What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Mrs. Burgin: Maybe in L.A?
Rachel Green: Yes!
Joshua Burgin: There you go.
Mr. Burgin: So, have you kids eaten yet?
Rachel Green: Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Mr. Burgin: Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Rachel Green: Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Mr. Burgin: So... We go eat.
Rachel Green: Yes.
Mr. Burgin: You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
