Rachel Green: Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Joey Tribbiani: All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Rachel Green: Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Really? A purse?
Rachel Green: It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Joey Tribbiani: It looks like a women's purse.
Rachel Green: No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Joey Tribbiani: See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Rachel Green: Exactly! Unisex!
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Rachel Green: No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
