Chandler Bing: Hi, honey! I'm home!
Monica Geller: Don't come in here!
Chandler Bing: Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Monica Geller: No! We only mess around at his place!
Chandler Bing: Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Monica Geller: No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Chandler Bing: Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Monica Geller: Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Chandler Bing: Well then why can't I see it?
Monica Geller: Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Chandler Bing: Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Monica Geller: Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Chandler Bing: Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Monica Geller: Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Chandler Bing: Okay!
