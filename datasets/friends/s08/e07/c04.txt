Brenda: Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where'd you get it?
Monica Geller: Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
Brenda: Okay. Uhh, I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
Monica Geller: I love her.
Brenda: I'll be back in a minute.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Chandler Bing: See? I told you.
Monica Geller: She stole my jeans!
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Chandler Bing: So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Monica Geller: Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
Chandler Bing: She must've been planning this for years!
Monica Geller: I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Chandler Bing: Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
Monica Geller: I guess.
Chandler Bing: So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
Monica Geller: Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
Chandler Bing: Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Monica Geller: Yeah!
