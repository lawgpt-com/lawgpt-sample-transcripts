Joey Tribbiani Sr.: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Joey Tribbiani: Since then?!
Joey Tribbiani Sr.: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
Joey Tribbiani: ...I d'know.
Joey Tribbiani Sr.: Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Joey Tribbiani: You're one to talk.
Joey Tribbiani Sr.: Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
