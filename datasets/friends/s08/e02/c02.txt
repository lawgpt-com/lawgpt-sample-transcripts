Ross Geller: Hi.
Chandler Bing: Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Ross Geller: Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Chandler Bing: Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
Ross Geller: Thread!
Chandler Bing: Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Ross Geller: What disposable cameras?
Chandler Bing: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Ross Geller: No you didn't.
Chandler Bing: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
Ross Geller: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that.
Chandler Bing: So you don't have the cameras?!
Ross Geller: No. Sorry man.
Chandler Bing: So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Ross Geller: Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
Chandler Bing: Great.
Ross Geller: In-in three minutes.
