Monica Geller: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
Chandler Bing: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Monica Geller: Yeah!
Chandler Bing: So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Monica Geller: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
Chandler Bing: What are you singing?
Monica Geller: It's "Bolero" from "10".
Chandler Bing: It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
Monica Geller: You what? You said you liked them.
Chandler Bing: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Monica Geller: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Chandler Bing: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Monica Geller: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
Chandler Bing: Hit yourself in the tooth?
Monica Geller: And the eye!
