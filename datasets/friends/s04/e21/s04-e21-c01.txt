Chandler Bing: Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Joey Tribbiani: I know. Ross is getting married.
Chandler Bing: Phoebe is, making people.
Joey Tribbiani: Everybody's doing stuff!
Chandler Bing: And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Joey Tribbiani: We could climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler Bing: No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Chandler Bing: Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Chandler Bing: We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: What-what's up?
Joey Tribbiani: We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler Bing: Yeah baby!
Phoebe Buffay: Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well...
Joey Tribbiani: We could get that Everest video though.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Joey Tribbiani: And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Chandler Bing: Oh, well...
Phoebe Buffay: So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Chandler Bing: Yeeeeahhhh.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Yeah.
Chandler Bing: But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah we are!
