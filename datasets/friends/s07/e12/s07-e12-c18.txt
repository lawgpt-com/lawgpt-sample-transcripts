Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
A Disembodied Voice: Phoebe Buffay?!
Phoebe Buffay: Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
The Fireman: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Phoebe Buffay: That's not mine.
The Fireman: Yes it is.
Phoebe Buffay: How do you know?
The Fireman: The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Phoebe Buffay: Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
The Fireman: Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Phoebe Buffay: Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
The Fireman: There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
Phoebe Buffay: There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
