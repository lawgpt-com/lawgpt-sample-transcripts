Chandler Bing: Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, 10:30.
Chandler Bing: What time is it now?
Joey Tribbiani: 4:30.
Chandler Bing: Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Chandler Bing: Yes. Vividly.
Joey Tribbiani: She was kidding about that right?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Joey Tribbiani: God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Chandler Bing: Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, I don't know.
Chandler Bing: She was kidding.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Chandler Bing: Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Joey Tribbiani: Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Chandler Bing: Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Chandler Bing: Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
