Rachel Green: Hi Ross!
Ross Geller: Hey Rachel.
Rachel Green: Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Ross Geller: Umm, no.
Rachel Green: Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Ross Geller: That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Rachel Green: Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Sit down!
Ross Geller: Okay.
Rachel Green: Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
Ross Geller: We're sorry.
Rachel Green: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Ross Geller: Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Rachel Green: Aw what are you?! A detective?
Ross Geller: Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Rachel Green: Oh.
Ross Geller: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Rachel Green: Who are these men?
Ross Geller: Men. I guy I know.
Rachel Green: Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Ross Geller: She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Rachel Green: Good day for married people huh?
Ross Geller: I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Rachel Green: I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Ross Geller: Try telling my wife that.
