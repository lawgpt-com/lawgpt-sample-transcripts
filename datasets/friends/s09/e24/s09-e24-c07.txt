Rachel Green: What, is everything ok?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Rachel Green: Nooooo, why?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Rachel Green: Oh, that's crazy!
Joey Tribbiani: No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Rachel Green: ... yeah, it's true.
Joey Tribbiani: I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Rachel Green: What, hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Ok, Rach!
Joey Tribbiani: I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?

Joey Tribbiani: Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
Rachel Green: Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Joey Tribbiani: I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Rachel Green: Yeah, I'm not talking about her...

Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Rachel Green: No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Joey Tribbiani: Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Rachel Green: Yeah, sure!
