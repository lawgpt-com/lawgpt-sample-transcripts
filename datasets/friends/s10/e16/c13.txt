Rachel Green: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross Geller: That's what it seemed like.
Rachel Green: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Ross Geller: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Rachel Green: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Ross Geller: Rach!
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: You keep, you keep... You can't...
Rachel Green: WHAT?
