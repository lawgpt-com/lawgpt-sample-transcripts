Ross Geller: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
Rachel Green: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Ross Geller: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Joey Tribbiani: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Ross Geller: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
Rachel Green: No awareness.
Ross Geller: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
Ross Geller: My fajitas!!
Rachel Green: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Charlie Wheeler: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
Charlie Wheeler: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Ross Geller: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Rachel Green: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Ross Geller: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
