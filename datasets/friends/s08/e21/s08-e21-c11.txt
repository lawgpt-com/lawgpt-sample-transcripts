Chandler Bing: ...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
Phoebe Buffay: Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
Chandler Bing: What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Phoebe Buffay: I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Chandler Bing: Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Phoebe Buffay: You gotta go!
Chandler Bing: Oh!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
Chandler Bing: Really?
Phoebe Buffay: Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
