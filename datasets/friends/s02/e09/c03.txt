Grandmother: Esther Livingston. Gone.
Grandmother: Hi, Phoe.
Phoebe Buffay: Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Grandmother: Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Phoebe Buffay: Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Grandmother: Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Phoebe Buffay: Just, you know, to see... um.
Grandmother: Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
Phoebe Buffay: OK, is this really my father?
Grandmother: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Phoebe Buffay: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Grandmother: Look, I. . .
Phoebe Buffay: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Grandmother: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh God.
Grandmother: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Phoebe Buffay: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Grandmother: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
Phoebe Buffay: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Grandmother: Honey.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Grandmother: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
