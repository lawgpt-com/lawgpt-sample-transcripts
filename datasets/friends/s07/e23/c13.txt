Rachel Green: Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh man.
Rachel Green: Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Well there's one down.
Monica Geller: I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Monica Geller: I'm gonna start getting ready!
Rachel Green: God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Phoebe Buffay: Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Rachel Green: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Rachel Green: I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Rachel Green: Oh!
Phoebe Buffay: No-no! I-I...I found one.
Rachel Green: Okay.

Rachel Green: Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Phoebe Buffay: Sure. Do you need some floss?
Rachel Green: Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh here's a whole bunch.
Rachel Green: Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God!
Rachel Green: What?
Phoebe Buffay: There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
