Joey Tribbiani: Thank you!
Phoebe Buffay: Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani: : Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
Joey Tribbiani: If you want I could loan you some money?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Phoebe Buffay: You could do that?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, really?
Joey Tribbiani: No it is awesome!

Phoebe Buffay: Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Ross Geller: Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Joey Tribbiani: She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Rachel Green: Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
Ross Geller: I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
