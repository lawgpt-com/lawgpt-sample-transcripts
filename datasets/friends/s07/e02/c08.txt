Monica Geller: I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Judy Geller: We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Monica Geller: You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Jack Geller: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Judy Geller: We really do feel bad about this though.
Jack Geller: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Monica Geller: What about when I started dating Chandler?
Judy Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Chandler Bing: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Monica Geller: I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Judy Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Jack Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.
Judy Geller: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
Jack Geller: All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
