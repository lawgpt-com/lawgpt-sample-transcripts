Joey Tribbiani: Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Director: Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.
Joey Tribbiani: Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
Phoebe Buffay: I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Joey Tribbiani: You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
