Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Monica Geller: Oh boy me too!
Chandler Bing: Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Monica Geller: Yeah?
Chandler Bing: Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Monica Geller: The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Chandler Bing: That's me! Come on!
Monica Geller: Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Chandler Bing: Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Monica Geller: Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
