Both: Hey, buddy.
Ross Geller: Hi.

Ross Geller: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, ah- the kid has it.
Ross Geller: The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Kid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Chandler Bing: You gotta do it, man.
Ross Geller: Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Kid: No.
Ross Geller: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
Kid: No! No!
