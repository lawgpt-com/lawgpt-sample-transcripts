Doug: Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
Chandler Bing: Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
Doug: Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Chandler Bing: Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
Doug: Oh? Why not?
Chandler Bing: It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
Doug: What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
Chandler Bing: Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
Doug: So why can't the three of us go out together?
Chandler Bing: Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Doug: Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
Chandler Bing: Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Doug: Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
Chandler Bing: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
