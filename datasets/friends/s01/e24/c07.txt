Chandler Bing: Hey, big...
Joey Tribbiani: Shhhh!
Chandler Bing: ...spender.
Joey Tribbiani: She's still asleep.
Chandler Bing: So how'd it go?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler Bing: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler Bing: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Joey Tribbiani: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Chandler Bing: I didn't know you had another level.
Joey Tribbiani: I know! Neither did I!
