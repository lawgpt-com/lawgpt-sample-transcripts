Joey Tribbiani: All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Phoebe Buffay: You know he's gay?
Ross Geller: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle: Chandler?
Chandler Bing: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
#ALL#: Hi. Hi.
Chandler Bing: What are you doing here?
Danielle: Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Chandler Bing: ...I'm, I'm okay.
Danielle: Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Chandler Bing: That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Danielle: You got it.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Danielle: G'bye, everybody.
#ALL#: Bye.
Phoebe Buffay: Whoo-hoo!
Monica Geller: Yeah, there you go!
Ross Geller: Second date!
Chandler Bing: ...I dunno.
Rachel Green: You don't know?!
Chandler Bing: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
