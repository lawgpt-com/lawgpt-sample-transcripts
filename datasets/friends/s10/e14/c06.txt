Monica Geller: Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Chandler Bing: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Realtor: Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
Monica Geller: Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Joey Tribbiani: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Monica Geller: No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Monica Geller: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
Monica Geller: No it's not!
Joey Tribbiani: Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Chandler Bing: When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
Monica Geller: Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Joey Tribbiani: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Monica Geller: Joey, we know that's you.
Joey Tribbiani: no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
