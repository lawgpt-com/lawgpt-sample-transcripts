Rachel Green: I'm unpacking!
Monica Geller: What?!
Rachel Green: I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Monica Geller: It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Rachel Green: Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Monica Geller: Because it's my apartment!
Rachel Green: Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Monica Geller: How about, you're moving!!
Rachel Green: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, how are you guys doing?
Rachel Green: Great! Monica's moving!
Monica Geller: I am not!
Rachel Green: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Monica Geller: No Phoebe I am mad!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Rachel Green: Yeah, I'm just mad!
Phoebe Buffay: Then keep running.
