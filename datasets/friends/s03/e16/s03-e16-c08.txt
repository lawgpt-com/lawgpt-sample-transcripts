Chandler Bing: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Ross Geller: You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Chandler Bing: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Ross Geller: What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Chandler Bing: He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Ross Geller: Yeah, but don't you think....
Chandler Bing: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Ross Geller: Yeah, okay.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Ross Geller: What trail?
Joey Tribbiani: The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Ross Geller: Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Chandler Bing: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
