Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Ross Geller: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Phoebe Buffay: You didn't tell her did you?
Ross Geller: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Ross Geller: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Phoebe Buffay: What do you mean, comforted her?
Ross Geller: It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Phoebe Buffay: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Ross Geller: It's also a sign of friendship.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
Ross Geller: It was a hug!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Ross Geller: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Phoebe Buffay: Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Ross Geller: I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Ross Geller: If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
