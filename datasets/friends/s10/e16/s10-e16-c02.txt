Monica Geller: Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
Erica: I know.
Monica Geller: You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Erica: No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Ross Geller: Hey!
Erica: Hi.
Ross Geller: Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
Erica: That's because I'm pregnant!
Ross Geller: Right, no, I understand.
Erica: Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
Ross Geller: No, no, I knew .
Monica Geller: Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Ross Geller: She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Erica: Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Monica Geller: Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Ross Geller: Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Monica Geller: Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Erica: Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Ross Geller: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Monica Geller: Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Erica: I'll be right back.
Ross Geller: Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Monica Geller: Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Ross Geller: No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Monica Geller: Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Ross Geller: Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Monica Geller: Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Ross Geller: Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Monica Geller: Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
