Chandler Bing: Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Chandler Bing: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Rachel Green: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Monica Geller: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Rachel Green: What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Monica Geller: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Rachel Green: Well, what about my stuff?
Monica Geller: You don't have any stuff.
Rachel Green: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Monica Geller: No.
Rachel Green: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Monica Geller: Mmmmm.
Rachel Green: Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
