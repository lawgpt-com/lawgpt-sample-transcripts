Cashier: Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
Rachel Green: Oh.
Ross Geller: Oh.
Rachel Green: No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
Ross Geller: We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
Cashier: Why don't you fill out this address card.
Ross Geller: Oh, okay.
Cashier: I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
Ross Geller: I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
Cashier: Really?! That is so cool!
Rachel Green: Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
Cashier: Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
Ross Geller: Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
Cashier: Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
Ross Geller: That's my gym.
Cashier: I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones.
Ross Geller: I am like Indiana Jones.
