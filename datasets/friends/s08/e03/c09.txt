Front Desk Clerk: As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
Monica Geller: No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Man: Who are you?
Chandler Bing: We're you just ten seconds later!
Monica Geller: Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Woman: Well you can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay. We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
Chandler Bing: We need the stuff.
