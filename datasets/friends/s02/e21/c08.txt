Chandler Bing: Your cappucino sir.
Ross Geller: Thank you.
Chandler Bing: Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Ross Geller: Absolutely.
Ross Geller: How come it's not mixing with the water?
Chandler Bing: Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Chandler Bing: Ok.
Ross Geller: No.
Chandler Bing: No?
Ross Geller: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Chandler Bing: Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Ross Geller: Yeah, sure.
Joey Tribbiani: By someone besides Monica?
Ross Geller: No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Chandler Bing: Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
