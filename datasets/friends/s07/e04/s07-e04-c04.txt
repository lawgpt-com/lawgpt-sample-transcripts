Chandler Bing: No-no-no-no. Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Monica Geller: Hey sweetie.
Chandler Bing: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Monica Geller: I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Chandler Bing: Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Monica Geller: Awww. But still no.
Chandler Bing: No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Monica Geller: Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Chandler Bing: Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Monica Geller: If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Chandler Bing: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Monica Geller: Oh my God. He threw up?
Chandler Bing: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Monica Geller: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Chandler Bing: That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Monica Geller: That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
