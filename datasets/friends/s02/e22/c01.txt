Monica Geller: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
#ALL#: Ohhh.
Monica Geller: What?
Ross Geller: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Monica Geller: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Ross Geller: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Joey Tribbiani: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Monica Geller: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Monica Geller: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Chandler Bing: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
