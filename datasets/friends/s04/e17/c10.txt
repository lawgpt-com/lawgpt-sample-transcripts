Ross Geller: She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Monica Geller: This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Ross Geller: Well...
Monica Geller: Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Ross Geller: I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Chandler Bing: You put your fist through the wall?
Ross Geller: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Monica Geller: You have to go to London!
Ross Geller: What?
Monica Geller: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Monica Geller: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Ross Geller: I made fun of his accent.
Monica Geller: You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross Geller: No.
Monica Geller: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Ross Geller: Really?
Monica Geller: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Ross Geller: All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Monica Geller: All right.
Ross Geller: I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Monica Geller: Okay, good luck!

Joey Tribbiani: Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
