Monica Geller: Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Peter Becker: It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
Monica Geller: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Peter Becker: What, look back?
Monica Geller: Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Peter Becker: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Monica Geller: Well, no. But...
Peter Becker: Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Monica Geller: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Peter Becker: Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Monica Geller: You didn't know that already?
Peter Becker: Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Monica Geller: Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Peter Becker: Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Monica Geller: Yeah. That-that was the problem.
