Ross Geller: I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Monica Geller: Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Ross Geller: They kept your room for a while.
Monica Geller: Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Ross Geller: Come on, you know they love you.
Monica Geller: As much as they love you?
Ross Geller: I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey.
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Ugh, I hate this year!
Ross Geller: What's wrong with this year?
Phoebe Buffay: Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Monica Geller: That was me and Ross.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh that's right!
Ross Geller: Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Monica Geller: Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Ross Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah, like you never called!
