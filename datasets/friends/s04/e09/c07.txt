Allesandro: I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Monica Geller: I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Allesandro: Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Monica Geller: The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Allesandro: Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Monica Geller: All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Allesandro: Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Allesandro: Lebanon.
Monica Geller: Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Allesandro: How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
