Emily Waltham: Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Monica Geller: Nooo!
Rachel Green: I know!
Monica Geller: Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Rachel Green: What?! We can't do that!
Monica Geller: We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Rachel Green: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Monica Geller: I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Rachel Green: I don't think he's the one who needs help.

Monica Geller: No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Rachel Green: Ugh!
Monica Geller: Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Rachel Green: Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Answering Machine: Your messages have been erased.
Rachel Green: Noooooooo!
