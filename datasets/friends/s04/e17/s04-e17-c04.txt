The Doctor: Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Phoebe Buffay: Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
The Doctor: No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Phoebe Buffay: Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
The Doctor: Doctors are wrong all the time.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, yeah.
Rachel Green: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
The Doctor: Definitely.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
The Doctor: Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
Phoebe Buffay: What do you know?!
