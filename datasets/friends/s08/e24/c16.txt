Joey Tribbiani: Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
Rachel Green: Nothing.
Joey Tribbiani: What is it? Hey!
Rachel Green: Really it's nothing. I'm just...
Joey Tribbiani: Rach come on, what?
Rachel Green: I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Joey Tribbiani: What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Rachel Green: Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Rachel Green: I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I guess so.
Rachel Green: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
Rachel Green: Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
