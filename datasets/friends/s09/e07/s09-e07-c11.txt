Monica Geller: So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Chandler Bing: Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Monica Geller: That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Joey Tribbiani: Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
Monica Geller: Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Chandler Bing: Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Monica Geller: Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Chandler Bing: This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Monica Geller: Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Monica Geller: Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Monica Geller: Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Chandler Bing: Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Monica Geller: THAT'S NOT ME!
Chandler Bing: What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Monica Geller: That bastard taped over me!
Chandler Bing: Is that a problem?
Monica Geller: I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
