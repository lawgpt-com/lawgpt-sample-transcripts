Joey Tribbiani: Of course it was a line!
Monica Geller: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Ross Geller: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Monica Geller: I hate men! I hate men!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Monica Geller: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Phoebe Buffay: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
Monica Geller: I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Joey Tribbiani: I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: Guess what?
Ross Geller: You got a job?
Rachel Green: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Chandler Bing: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Rachel Green: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Chandler Bing: Oh, how well you know me...
Rachel Green: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Monica Geller: How'd you pay for them?
Rachel Green: Uh, credit card.
Monica Geller: And who pays for that?
Rachel Green: Um... my... father.
