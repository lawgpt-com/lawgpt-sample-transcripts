Chandler Bing: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Rachel Green: Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: So, um, did she...
Ross Geller: Twice.
Joey Tribbiani: Twice?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, that sucks!
Joey Tribbiani: You guys okay?
Ross Geller: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Ross Geller: Nono, she's gone.
Monica Geller: We checked. A lot.
Phoebe Buffay: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Rachel Green: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Phoebe Buffay: Thanks!
Rachel Green: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Joey Tribbiani: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
