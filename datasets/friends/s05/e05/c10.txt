Rachel Green: Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Phoebe Buffay: Come where?
Rachel Green: Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Ross Geller: Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Ross Geller: Hi.
Rachel Green: Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Ross Geller: I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Rachel Green: Oh, Ross...
Ross Geller: No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Rachel Green: No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Ross Geller: Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Rachel Green: Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Ross Geller: I can't believe this is happening.
Rachel Green: I know.
Ross Geller: I am so sorry.
Rachel Green: I know that too.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
