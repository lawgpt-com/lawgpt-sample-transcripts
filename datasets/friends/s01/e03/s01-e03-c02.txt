Chandler Bing: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Joey Tribbiani: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Chandler Bing: Hey, that was really good!
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks! Let's keep going.
Chandler Bing: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Chandler Bing: "Smoke away."
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: Relax your hand!
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Not so much!
Joey Tribbiani: Whoah!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Alright, now try taking a puff.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Joey Tribbiani: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Chandler Bing: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Joey Tribbiani: Y'miss it?
Chandler Bing: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
