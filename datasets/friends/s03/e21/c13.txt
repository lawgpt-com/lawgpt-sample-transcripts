Chandler Bing: I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.

Chandler Bing: If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Chandler Bing: Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
