Rachel Green: Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Rachel Green: What? What!?! You kissed him?
Phoebe Buffay: Totally.
Rachel Green: Phoebe are you serious?

Phoebe Buffay: No!
Rachel Green: Phoebe...
Phoebe Buffay: What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
