Ross Geller: It's your turn.
Chandler Bing: Oh, are we playing this?!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Chandler Bing: Hey! How'd the audition go?
Joey Tribbiani: Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Ross Geller: Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, did I fool ya?
Ross Geller: Totally!
Chandler Bing: So it did go well.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, it went amazingly well!
Ross Geller: Great!
Chandler Bing: Oh that's great!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!
Ross Geller: Wow!
Joey Tribbiani: And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Ross Geller: Oh, I love that guy!
Chandler Bing: Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Ross Geller: What am I doing?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Chandler Bing: Well, it is overdue.
Ross Geller: Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Joey Tribbiani: There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Ross Geller: Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
