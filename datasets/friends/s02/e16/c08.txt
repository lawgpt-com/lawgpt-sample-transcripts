Richard Burke: How ya doin'?
Monica Geller: I'm a twinkie.
Richard Burke: Really? I'm a hero.
Monica Geller: Oh, this is so hard.
Richard Burke: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Monica Geller: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Richard Burke: My parents are dead.
Monica Geller: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Richard Burke: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
Monica Geller: Alright.
Richard Burke: Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
Judy Geller: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Ross Geller: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
Judy Geller: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Ross Geller: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Judy Geller: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Ross Geller: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Judy Geller: Really.
Ross Geller: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
Judy Geller: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Ross Geller: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Judy Geller: Oh Jack stop.
Ross Geller: C'mon, it's my birthday.
