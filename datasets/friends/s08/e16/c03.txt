Monica Geller: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey.
Monica Geller: I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
Ross Geller: Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
Monica Geller: All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
Ross Geller: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.
Monica Geller: Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
Ross Geller: Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
Monica Geller: Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Ross Geller: He's not?
Monica Geller: No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
Ross Geller: Why?
Monica Geller: He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
Ross Geller: Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
Monica Geller: Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
Ross Geller: Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.
Monica Geller: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
