Joey Tribbiani: Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Chandler Bing: Really?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Chandler Bing: Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Joey Tribbiani: All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Chandler Bing: Whoa!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Chandler Bing: Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Joey Tribbiani: Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Chandler Bing: Good luck!
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Chandler Bing: I see.
