Rachel Green: So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Elizabeth Stevens: What a nice story!
Paul Stevens: So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Rachel Green: Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Ross Geller: Yeah, take your time.

Ross Geller: Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Paul Stevens: Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Ross Geller: Not all bad.
Paul Stevens: And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Ross Geller: Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Paul Stevens: I beg your pardon?
Ross Geller: No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Paul Stevens: You have a son?
Ross Geller: Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Paul Stevens: Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Rachel Green: Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Ross Geller: You're back.
Paul Stevens: You two were married?!
Rachel Green: Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
