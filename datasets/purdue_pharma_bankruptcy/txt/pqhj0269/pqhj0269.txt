THE COURT:

Okay.

Good morning, everyone.

This

3

is Judge Drain, and we're here in In re Purdue Pharma, LP,

4

et al, on the Debtor's request for approval of confirmation

5

of their amended plan.

6

to proceed along the order that's set forth in that witness

7

list.

8
9

I have the witness list and prepared

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Good morning, Your Honor.

Benjamin Kaminetzky of Davis Polk for the Debtors.

Welcome

10

to the confirmation hearing.

11

matters that -- along those lines that Your Honor said we

12

should convey to the Court in real time.

13

matters I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Huebner.

14

We have a few housekeeping

The first few

Then I have a few stipulations to -- the parties

15

have reached that should be able to streamline the

16

proceedings and the testimony, which I think we should do

17

first, and then proceed to the witnesses if that works for

18

the Court.

19

to start us off with the first, like, administrative stuff.

So if I could just turn it over to Mr. Huebner

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. HUEBNER:

Okay.

That's fine.

Thanks.

Good morning, Your Honor.

Marshall

22

Huebner of Davis, Polk, and Wardwell on behalf of the

23

Debtors.

24

there is a microphone on somewhere where someone is banging

25

a lot of books and papers.

212-267-6868

One initial housekeeping point.

It sounds like

And so if there is someone other

than the Court who is not on mute, if they could go on mute

2

I think it would be very helpful to the hundred or more

3

people who are listening in.

4

Your Honor, four essentially housekeeping matters

5

on my end.

6

a work.

7

having been brought to this juncture out of respect to the

8

fairness and rights to all parties, so let me deal with

9

mechanics.

10

There are no opening statements.

I will not say

There are many things I would like to say about

Number one, just as a reminder to all people and

11

persons who are interested, the Court has taken

12

extraordinary steps to ensure the most possible public

13

access to this hearing as well as predecessor hearings.

14

There is both a toll free line that people can dial into to

15

listen to every minute of these proceedings.

16

two rooms set up in the courthouse so that anybody who also

17

wants to view the video aid and whatever exhibits you'll put

18

up on the screen and the like, that's available as well.

19

There are also

One is sort of a COVID protocol room for people

20

who either are not vaccinated with more social distancing,

21

and the other is for people that prove their vaccination

22

(indiscernible) make sure that members of the public and

23

others knew that all these steps have been taken to make the

24

proceedings as public and transparent and available as

25

possible.

THE COURT:

Can I interrupt you on that point?

2

Because I want to make sure people have the right address.

When you say these rooms are available at the court, they're

4

available at the Bankruptcy Court at 1 Bowling Green in

MR. HUEBNER:

Correct.

Correct, Your Honor.

I

7

should've said that.

For ease of travel for many people and

8

for logistics, that was what the court was able to set up.

9

Number two, Your Honor, you had asked at a recent

10

status conference, and we wanted to confirm for everybody's

11

benefit, what has happened with respect to the schedule of

12

matters that, in fact, were previously scheduled to be heard

13

in one case on August 16th and August 19th.

14

explain for everybody's benefit.

15

Let me just

On August 16th, there are several pro se matters

16

on, six in total.

17

that are not.

18

(indiscernible).

19

reschedule pro se things because people who are pro se often

20

have, you know, difficulty arranging for attendance, have to

21

take time off from work.

22

Four of them are fully consensual, two

We are (indiscernible) with a similar
We have worked very hard never to

Some as we know are incarcerated, and so we will

23

proceed -- we will deal with all six of those the morning of

24

the 16th, but we think that can go very quickly.

25

thing that we're going to keep on the docket for the 16th is

212-267-6868

being in fact that there are fully resolved with the field

2

examiner appointed by the court in the case, fee

3

applications, we would propose to move forward with those as

4

well.

5

scheduled for thee 16th will take under an hour.

And our hope is that the entire docket previously

6

We have a very different view with respect to the

7

19th because those are larger matters that are sort of, you

8

know, law-firm related.

9

of which is the Debtor's -- well, which are two of the

And so for those three matters, one

10

Debtor's motions, and one of which is the motion by the Ad

11

Hoc Individual Victims Committee perspective.

12

we propose to adjourn all of those until essentially

13

immediately after the conclusion of the confirmation

14

hearing.

15

And that is

We don't want to burden the many parties dialing

16

in for confirmation, and certainly not run the meter with

17

the many parties who are billing time for confirmation.

18

to sit there and watch an omnibus hearing go on, it could

19

take a little bit more time.

20

Hoc Committee of Individual Victims has consented to the

21

adjournment at the end of the confirmation.

22

play it by ear.

23

So

The individual committee -- Ad

So we'll just

If the end of confirmation (indiscernible) and the

24

lawyers (indiscernible) 3:00, great.

25

the answer is we will see you all in the morning, you know,

212-267-6868

If we end at 3:00 and

if it's a relatively smaller number of parties, and for all

2

-- obviously, if we book all the days of next week and the

3

week after other than the 24th, and we'll just be flexible

4

and play it by ear.

Item number three, Your Honor --

5

THE COURT:

Can I just interrupt you again.

6

Mr. Troop, did you have something to say on that?

7

MR. TROOP:

Yes, Your Honor.

Because these

8

hearings were originally scheduled for the 19th, today would

9

otherwise be the deadline for filing objections to those

10

pending motions, and there's still some blowbacks going on

11

with respect to them and the like.

12

Debtor's desire to be able to play it by ear, but I'm also

13

hopeful that we will be able to pick an objection deadline

14

that is at least a week from today so that we can have some

15

control over schedule timing and responses.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. HUEBNER:

18

THE COURT:

I understand the

That's fine.
Yeah.

Your Honor, that --

I think you could work that out among

19

yourselves.

20

generically describe the adjourned date, can also state the

21

objection deadline.

22

And the notice of adjournment, which would just

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah.

Your Honor, we'll work with

23

Mr. Troop.

24

to set an objection deadline for him.

25

will object, but if somebody does it will probably be one of

212-267-6868

And of course, he's totally right.

We do need

And we'll figure out an objection to find that

And Mr. Troop, thank you for raising the issue.
You're, of course, correct.

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. HUEBNER:

People know the time.

Okay.
Your Honor, with respect to

7

overnight filings, I do want to be clear for the benefit of

8

all parties.

9

literally around the clock as -- personally on hours of

You know, we have been working like literally,

10

conference calls with Sackler who represented us yesterday,

11

and those were just conference calls.

12

Overnight we did file two very important

13

documents.

14

(indiscernible).

15

people can review them as (indiscernible).

16

not super duper material.

17

probably self-explanatory.

18

through those changes, but I believe at some point during

19

the hearing if that proves (indiscernible) appropriate, we

20

will of course do so.

21

Number 1 is we did file a seventh amended
I think that on the whole, paper changes,
I think they're

In most cases, I think they're
I'm not proposing to walk

We've also filed further kind of supplemental

22

documents with further amended (indiscernible) with

23

(indiscernible) documents will be negotiated, not only

24

entirely really by the Debtors, but really by the ad hoc

25

committee and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors

2

negotiating parties.

3

very close to done.

4

Both documents are now very, very,

You know, we don't know within sort of a football

5

metaphor whether I'd describe this as the one-third of the

6

yard line or the one-eighth of a yard line.

7

that there are really at this point largely only

8

(indiscernible), that we will be very soon filing absolutely

9

unexecuted finished copies, but I think that there are then,

But I think

10

you know, issues that are truly lawyer issues.

But in many

11

cases, while important, are highly technical in terms of

12

how, you know, remedies work, expirations, and the like.

13

I think there are people there -- it's already

14

been a while since there were sort of level 1 material

15

business points that we're still moving.

16

we're lawyers and it's a multi-billion dollar deal and we're

17

taking several years, obviously, (indiscernible) the risk.

18

And so representatives of multiple law firms of the AHC, as

19

well as obviously the UCC, as well as the Debtors, the

20

Sacklers, are working very hard to make sure that we can

21

button up all the risks and have things be in the most

22

comfortable way.

23

But you know,

Your Honor, one last point, I do see that Mr.

24

Andino has sent out a new audio bridge.

It may be that

25

there was a problem with the other one.

I'm not positive,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 43
1

but if the Court would like, I could read that out loud.

2

if anybody wants access, the number that was just sent at

3

10:16 a.m. 120 seconds ago, they can have it and write it

4

down (indiscernible) or I'm happy to do that.

5
6

THE COURT:

So

Why don't you just say that -- the

number if you can?

7

MR. HUEBNER:

Sure.

So the new -- the -- I don't

8

know if this is new or amended, but it does look like it's

9

new because it says "correction" on the telephone dial-in.

10

The correct audio bridge for the general public is 844-867-

11

6163, and the access code is 9263332 and then you hit pound.

12

With that, Your Honor, my sort of, you know, housekeeping in

13

print matters are concluded.

14

go get the witnesses, and I go back on mute, and turn it

15

over back to Mr. Kaminetzky.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

17

MR. KAMINETZKY:

And as the Court requested, we

Thank you.
Your Honor, there are two

18

stipulations that the Debtor would like to put into the

19

record.

20

party interest requested that the Debtors stipulate on the

21

record that no party will be prejudiced by relying on the

22

testimony elicited by others during cross.

23

First, the United States Trustee and one other

We understand that the U.S. Trustee wants to have

24

his stipulation on the record because the U.S. Trustee

25

believes this this would obviate the need for parties to ask

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 44
1

duplicative questions or to speak at the close of other

2

parties' cross-examinations simply to put their reservations

3

or joinders on the record.

4

obviously point that you don't have to ask the same

5

questions and elicit the same testimony, but we were asked

6

to put that on the record.

7

fine with that.

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. KAMINETZKY:

I think this is a kind of

And of course, the Debtors are

Okay.
Of course, (indiscernible) more

10

sense to me.

The second is a little bit more involved.

11

It's taking to heart Your Honor's comments at the final pre-

12

trial conference about using the evidentiary portion of this

13

hearing efficiently.

14

Sackler families, both side A and side B, reached agreement

15

on the terms of the stipulation that is intended to ensure

16

that no party would be prejudiced by a decision to limit or

17

forego presentation of evidence at the confirmation hearing.

18

To be clear, this is not a stipulation that's been

agreed to by the Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, or

Maryland states.

The Daubert Motion filed by side A of William

permission, Mr. Lee, who represents -- from Milbank who

3

Court of an update with respect to an agreement between the

4

families and certain of this case.

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. LEES:

Okay.
Good morning, Your Honor.

Alex Lees of

7

Milbank for the Raymond Sackler family.

As Mr. Kaminetzky

8

alluded to, following the final pre-trial conference before

9

Your Honor on Monday, we took to heart Your Honor's

10

suggestion that we meet and confer and try to find a way to

11

streamline evidentiary issues at trial, and I'm happy to

12

report we had a very good outcome.

13

I will read a stipulation into the record that is

14

among the Raymond Sackler family, the Mortimer Sackler

15

family, and the States of Washington, Connecticut, and

16

Oregon, who, for purposes of the stipulation, I will refer

17

to as the objecting states.

clarification because Maryland is not joining the

19

stipulation.

20

context for what that means for the hearing.

I have to make that

And after I read this, I will provide some

21

THE COURT:

22

MR. LEES:

Okay.
One, no party will ask the Court to

23

make a finding or conclusion at the confirmation hearing on

24

the ultimate merits of any underlying opioid claim against

25

the Debtors or the Sackler families.

Two, the Raymond

Three, the documents on the Raymond Sackler

6

8

clarity, that also means that the expert reports of Mr.

9

Hrycay and Mr. Kane would be admitted into evidence subject

10

For

to cross-examination of those witnesses.

11

Four, the fact that a party did not present

12

evidence or take testimony other than in accordance with

13

this stipulation at the confirmation hearing concerning the

14

merits of underlying opioid claims against the Debtors or

15

the Sackler families, or defenses thereto, shall not have

16

any affect or bearing on any future litigation of the merits

17

of such claims, including if there is a snapback in

18

litigation against the snapback.

19

That is the stipulation, Your Honor.

I think this

20

is a good development, as I mentioned, because the vast

21

majority of the objections to the families' proposed

22

exhibits were from the states who were parties to the

23

stipulation.

As I mentioned --

24

THE COURT:

25

MR. LEES:

212-267-6868

So -As I mentioned --

THE COURT:

2

MR. LEES:

3

THE COURT:

-- can I just -Yes.
-- before you get to the next point in

4

which you were going to say, are you going to file this on

5

the docket and send a copy to chambers so we can focus our

6

preparation on -- I think I understood what you said and

7

people have been taking notes, but I just want to make sure

8

what's agreed so that I can prepare for that portion of the

9

hearing.

10

MR. LEES:

Of course, Your Honor.

We're more than

11

happy to do so, and I can do that as soon as I finish here

12

and sit down at my computer.

13

We -- the context that I wanted to give Your Honor

14

is that the vast majority of the objections to the family's

15

proposed evidentiary presentation came from the parties --

16

the states that are parties to this stipulation.

17

is an exception, but the reason why I think this is still

18

going to resolve substantially all of the evidentiary issues

19

is that Maryland's objections to the family's exhibit lists

20

were quite narrow based on the master exhibit lists that the

21

Debtors have been circulating among the parties that

22

compiles the objections.

23

Maryland

And based on the correspondence we have seen as

24

well, we understand that at least for the B side, the only

25

extant objection is to the expert opinions of Professor

Larry Hamermesh, and that is the subject of a Daubert Motion

2

that was filed, we believe in an untimely manner.

3

any event, that is still the subject of the Daubert Motion

4

that Your Honor will get to in due course.

5

But in

But other than that, because no other objections

6

were raised to the evidentiary portion of the Sackler

7

family's -- sorry, the documentary evidence on the Sackler

8

family's list.

adversary process.

And we've been engaged in discussions

2

with them for weeks now saying just that, but they seem to

3

insist on presenting these documents and evidence that is

4

not relevant to the issues before the Court.

5

THE COURT:

Well, look, I'm not sure what

THE COURT:

All right.

MS. PULLO:

Correct.

Ms. Pullo, you submitted a declaration

that declaration is updated and corrected by your second

declaration submitted in this matter, which is dated August

that you'd like to change knowing it would be your direct

testimony?

MS. PULLO:

And let me ask you, except as

No, there is not.

It's just entirely

superseded by the final one that was filed on August 2nd.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

And then let me ask you then,

11

as far as the August 2, 2021 final declaration is concerned,

12

knowing that it would be your direct testimony in this

13

matter under my order establishing procedures for the

14

matter, is there anything in it that you would wish to

15

change?

16

MS. PULLO:

No, there is not.

17

THE COURT:

Okay.

Very well.

All right.

So it

was intended to be Ms. Pullo's direct testimony, and does

anyone have any objection to its admission as Ms. Pullo's

will admit it then.

with cross.

MR. HIGGINS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

And

actually, but before that, we have one limited preliminary

matter based on our conversation with the debtors.

20

Pullo's -- Exhibit B to Ms. Pullo's declaration states that

21

ten states voted no, but they're not specifically

identified, and we ask the debtors whether or not the states

that voted no are set forth in the record anywhere.

ask Ms. Pullo directly, but we thought it'd be easier to get

it in by means of a stipulation, Your Honor.

So we just want to make sure the

Assuming that the states agree, we understand that the

Yes.

Thank you.

regarding the Debtor's Chapter 11 plan; is that correct?

That is correct.

And also in Paragraph 8, you list a chart that sets

7

forth the number of claims classified within each voting

8

class; is that right?

9

A

Yes.

10

Q

And it doesn't have the total here in the chart, but if

11

you were to add up those claims, it would add up to 618,194

claims; is that right?

13

A

I believe that is correct.

Thank you.

Yes.

Yes, that is right.

It's about a

MR. HIGGINS:

THE COURT:

4

MR. HIGGINS:

5

No, Your Honor.
All right.
Your Honor, the Debtors have argued,

and several parties have argued --

6

THE COURT:

No, no, I just wanted to get that on

7

the record because not everyone that listens to this

8

understands the requirements that Congress puts in for

9

voting in the Bankruptcy Code, although the U.S. Trustee

10

does.

So I really wanted to understand the U.S. Trustee's

11

understanding of the Bankruptcy Code, and I think you do

12

acknowledge that Congress says you count those who vote,

13

both in terms of percentage and number, correct?

14

MR. HIGGINS:

I've seen ballots that do not have that.

Yes, I do.

And even if those lists were not provided, were the

THE COURT:

Ms. Finegan.

Throughout your declaration, you refer to

various numbers of impressions or media impressions.

15

THE WITNESS:

16

THE COURT:

Yes.
You know, 2.6 billion media

17

THE WITNESS:

What is an impression, just so

occurrence of an ad.

THE WITNESS:

The impression will be delivered to

4

you on your device, whether that is a laptop, a mobile

5

device, or desktop, and that is specific to you.

THE COURT:

Well, so I guess that's my question

7

would be questions that would not call for a legal

8

conclusion, and there are ways that you could ask them where

9

that would be true, it's really not appropriate for this

I do see that, yes.

2

Q

And (indiscernible) testimony that in February 2018,

3

Purdue Pharma voluntarily ceased promoting opioid

4

medications through a sales force; is that right?

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

Does that mean that Purdue Pharma got rid of the sales

7

force that it had used to call on healthcare providers who

8

prescribed opioids?

9

A

I think it -- what it means and what I recall from

10

early 2018, is we eliminated our sales force in two

11

tranches.

12

that called on prescribers specifically related to opioids.

13

We had a second product that we discontinued, and I think a

14

few months later, we eliminated the remainder of ours sales

15

force that called upon that non-opioid product.

Q

17

product.

18

February 2018, did Purdue Pharma stop having its sales force

19

call upon healthcare providers who prescribed opioids?

20

A

21

that called on a non-opioid product, but not to promote

22

opioids.

23

Q

Okay.

24

A

Yeah, but the --

Q

Right.

The first was, we eliminated the sales forces

Okay.

Well, let me ask you about that non-opioid
Well, first, let's go back.

My question was, in

A

That's correct.

Q

Well, what is Symproic?

It was a product indicated for opioid-induced

And what was that other

And what kinds of doctors did -- well, there was a

11

A

Yes, there was.

12

Q

And what sort of doctors did they call upon?

13

A

I would imagine that they called on doctors that

14

prescribed opioids.

15

finance guy, but I would imagine that's the type of

16

prescribers they would call upon.

17

Q

18

you knew that, in fact, Symproic representatives called upon

19

the same doctors after February 2018 who prescribed opioids

20

to promote Symproic from them.

A

not know, but I would -- I would -- to the best of my

23

belief, many of those same doctors who prescribed opioids,

24

they would have called upon since they were the likely

prescribers of a product that treats opioid-induced

2

Q

3

February 2018, Purdue ceased promoting its opioid medication

4

for its sales force, Purdue continued to promote opioid and

5

opioid-induced constipation drug through a sales force to

6

the same doctors; isn't that true?

7

A

I would agree with that.

8

Q

Okay.

9

in your declaration, paragraph 9.

Okay.

And so, not withstanding your statement that in

Thank you.

I'm going to turn you also back to
I'm sorry.

It's fine

10

it's in there.

But let me just ask, the announcement, the -

11

- what you mentioned, the decision to -- in February 2018 to

12

discontinue part of the sales force, that was announced

13

publicly; was it not?

14

A

15

publicly or not.

16

Q

Okay.

17

A

I know it's been -- it's probably been in many filings

18

we've made; I just don't recall whether it was public.

19

sorry.

Q

21

you -- that Purdue made?

A

23

documents that we've had in the past.

Q

25

that right?

I honestly don't recall whether it was announced

Okay.

I'm

But you do recall it was made in filings that

I'm sure it has been represented as a date in -- in

4

suggest that its opioid sales force stopped calling on

5

healthcare providers regarding opioids in February 2018,

right?

Yes.

8

Q

And then, in fact --

So, Purdue has -- just to catch up here, Purdue

But we distinguish between --

MR. HIGGINS:

Your Honor.

Q

And in fact, it continued to call on the same doctors

11

after February 2018 despite the public announcements; that's

12

your testimony, right?

medication, so we were calling on opioid --

Well, my testimony is, I mean, Symproic is a non-opioid

16

MR. HIGGINS:

Move to strike, Your

Honor.

Objection.

THE COURT:

Sorry?

That's a perfectly responsive

answer.

19

MR. HIGGINS:

20

THE COURT:

Okay.
The way you've asked the question, it

21

would be that they would somehow -- linking opioid products

22

with products that address opioids, right?

23

responded to that, to clarify your question.

24
25

MR. HIGGINS:

All right.

So, Mr. Lowne's

Q

Mr. Lowne, what were the -- are you familiar with the

2

instructions that were given to sales representatives who

3

can -- who marketed Symproic to opioid prescribers following

4

February 2018?

5

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Object, Your Honor.

Again, I

6

don't know exactly where this is going.

I think the direct

7

examination, you know, as set out in the -- in the

8

declaration is very limited in its scope, and the use of,

9

you know, this information in connection with the arguments

10

made, in connection with, you know, future claims here,

11

which I'm not understanding that the State of Maryland has

12

objected to.

13

again, just cognizant of obviously, the number of witnesses

14

that we have and trying keep at the most -- within a

15

reasonable universe, I think I have to object, Your Honor.

16
17

I'm not sure exactly where this is going.

THE COURT:

But

Well, no, you can answer that question

Mr. Lowne, if you know the answer.

18

THE WITNESS:

So, to the best of my knowledge, I

19

mean, we made announcements to our -- all of our employees

20

that we'd ceased to promote our branded opioid products, and

21

our sales force that remained was limited to promoting

22

Symproic, which is a non-opioid product.

23

finance organization and not the commercial organization, I

24

don't know the exact instructions that were given to the

25

remaining sales representatives in terms of the promotion of

that that was the decision we'd made.

3

MR. HIGGINS:
Okay, Mr. Lowne.

Okay, Your Honor, but --

Q

I'm sorry.

But the answer is you

5

don't know the specific instructions that were given; it

that --

7

A

No.

8

Q

Okay.

9

A

No.

10

Q

Thank you.

11

little bit -- but can I turn you to Paragraph 9 of your

12

declaration?

13

A

Sure.

14

Q

And I'll refer you to the very last sentence of your

15

declaration -- of Paragraph 9 of your declaration, and it

16

says "These discussions covered matters" -- maybe I should

17

back up -- "You and other members of Management met with

18

teams in business to discuss their forecast.

19

discussions covered matters including sales projections for

nonopioid and over-the-counter products, research and

A

Yes, it is.

3

Q

And I want to refer you just to Medical Affairs.

4

is Medical Affairs?

A

6

for example, execute on post-marketing commitments that we

7

have for some of our products.

8
9

What

What are Medical Affairs expenses?

Medical Affairs Department does many things, but they,

So, for example, we have requirements to do a pediatric
study for our Adhansia products.

We have -- we had certain

10

remaining post-marketing commitments related to our opioid

11

products, which I believe for oxycontin are now complete.

12

They also have a group of individuals that are medical

13

professionals that answer questions on any our prescription

14

products.

15

Medical Affairs Department would do.

16

Q

17

include a position, multiple positions of medical affairs

18

liaison?

19

A

There is a position called a medical liaison, yes.

20

Q

And those medial liaisons, those are the people who, in

21

your testimony, answer questions of doctors, right?

22

A

23

the name of the job title -- that answers questions about

24

the products, but a medical liaison for Adhansia, not for

25

our opioid products, would maybe answer questions related to

Okay.

So they're some of the activities that the

And so the Medical Affairs Department, does that

Is that a position at Purdue?

We have a slightly different position -- I don't know

company that might be interested in putting Adhansia on

their drug formulary, which is what provides coverages to

patients in the pharmacy when they're looking to buy

5

Adhansia.

6

Q

7

they communicate with healthcare providers who prescribe

8

Purdue's products?

9

A

Okay.

Well, did Medical Affairs medical liaisons, do

To the best of my knowledge, if a healthcare provider

10

had a question on a prescription product, they are able to

11

call a person in our Medical Affairs group who is a

12

medically trained individual who would be able to answer a

13

question related to the prescribing of one of our products.

14

Q

15

providers who prescribe products for Purdue?

16

A

Are you -- yes, that's my understanding.

17

Q

And do they also conduct -- I believe you referenced

18

post-marketing, fulfillment of post-marketing requirements

19

under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act?

20

A

21

for any post-marketing requirements by the FDA.

Q

Purdue's obligations with respect to post-marketing

requirements by contacting and working with healthcare

my understanding is the persons in the Medical Affairs

The post-marketing requirements, to the extent there is

Department would work with a third-party contract research

11

organization that performs the clinical study.

12

are people that enroll patients within that clinical study.

13

Honestly, I'm not expert to know whether our people in

14

Medical Affairs are having direct contact with the people

15

that are contracted through the CRO with regard to the

16

progress of those clinical studies that are required by the

FDA.

MR. EDMUNDS:

And there

Your Honor, I briefly lost the feed for a second.

know -- can the answer be read back?

21

THE WITNESS:

22

THE COURT:

I don't

Sure.
No, but I think I can repeat it was

23

that Mr. Lowne wasn't sure whether the people that work in

24

this area do more than interact with the people who are

25

conducting studies in connection with the FDA or whether

they reach past them to patients that are in those studies.

2

He wasn't sure.

3

Is that a fair summary, Mr. Lowne?

THE WITNESS:

That's a fair summary related to the

4

FDA requirement question, yes.

5

BY MR. EDMUNDS:

6

Q

7

requirement that we are discussing, is that sometimes

8

referred to as investigator-initiated trials?

9

A

No, it's not.

10

Q

I'm sorry.

11

think you mentioned this -- is the idea at Purdue that the

12

liaison signs up the patients that a particular prescriber

13

is prescribing to in -- for purposes of post-marketing

14

studies?

15

A

16

that's any part of their role.

17

Affairs that, for example, not all of Medical Affairs

18

studies are clinical studies.

19

studies where they're looking at prescribing behaviors as I

20

understand it, but the actual clinical studies, we would

21

engage a third-party contract research organization to work

22

with different clinical sites that enroll the patients that

23

are required to be enrolled as part of the clinical study.

24

So there is certainly an individual within Medical Affairs

25

that works with that third-party contract research

And is the FDA requirement, post-marketing

Q

mentioned, is it one or is it multiple organizations?

contract research organizations because we have a pipeline

I would say it's -- I mean we do work with multiple

to is my -- the State of Maryland has objected to the third-

I think you've established that

Where there contractors that Purdue Pharma used to

understand your question.

6

Q

7

the subject of the guilty plea that Purdue entered earlier

8

this year?

9

A

That's correct.

Q

And just -- there's also -- the Speaker Program implies

11

that there are speakers; is that right?

There were actual speakers, yes.

That's my understanding.

They received fees or honoraria; is that right?

Collura's August 5th, 2021, declaration as his direct

8

All right.

And I take it that includes no one is

10

objecting to Mr. Collura's admission as an expert witness

11

with regard to his report, which is attached to his

12

declaration and incorporated in it.

note that Mr. Collura is testifying as an expert with

15

respect to the forensic accounting and related to materials

16

that are addressed in his expert report.

running this down.

6

THE COURT:

Well, he may have thought his

colleague, Mr. Collura, might have taken longer.

8

have the clerk's office contact him too?

9

MR. DUGGAN:

Can you

Your Honor, we have been in touch

him at the moment.

13

THE COURT:

I don't know if you want to

move onto Mr. DeRamus and then come back to him?

14
15

Okay.

MR. DUGGAN:

MR. DERAMUS:

THE COURT:

That's correct.
Okay.

Mr. DeRamus, you submitted a

declaration, which then attached your expert report.

12

dated June 15, 20201.

13

procedures for this hearing, you understood that this would

14

be your direct testimony in this hearing.

15

sitting here today on the 12th of August, is there anything

16

in your declaration or your expert report that you wish to

17

change?

18

MR. DERAMUS:

THE COURT:

The expert report is

Under my order establishing

Knowing that and

No, there's not.
Okay.

Does anyone object to the

20

introduction of Mr. DeRamus' declaration and expert report

21

as his direct testimony?

22

the exhibit, which is the expert report and I also gather no

23

one is objecting to Mr. DeRamus testifying as an expert

24

witness including with respect to the matters covered by his

25

expert report, including transfer pricing analysis and the

212-267-6868

Okay.

I will admit it, including

So I will admit the declaration

7

All right.

Does anyone wish to cross-examine Mr.

No?
All right.

I reviewed the report, as I did Mr.

Collura's report, and I don't have any questions on it.

10

hearing from no one else who wishes to cross-examine, you

11

can be excused, Mr. DeRamus.

12

MR. DERAMUS:

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. DUGGAN:

15

Thank you, Your Honor.
All right.

Has Mr. Rule been located?

Your Honor, I'm checking on this

right now.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. DUGGAN:

18

So

Okay.
I understand, Your Honor that Mr.

Rule should be logging in momentarily.

19

THE COURT:

Okay.

I think, while we're waiting

20

for him, it probably makes sense after his testimony to

21

break for lunch and then come back to deal with Mr. Dubel

22

and the other witnesses, unless I missing something.

23

MR. DUGGAN:

24

THE COURT:

25

MR. DUGGAN:

212-267-6868

No.

Very good, Your Honor.

Okay.
Your Honor, he is trying to log in.

We don't have him yet, but he's trying to log in.

2

apparently having a little difficulty.

3

THE COURT:

Right.

He's

If he wants someone from the

4

clerk's office to walk him through it, he's free to let you

5

know that so we can have someone do that.

6

MR. DUGGAN:

7

THE COURT:

8

Thank you, Your Honor.
Sometimes, it's case sensitive.

Sometimes there's 0 and O that can get mixed up.

9

MAN 1:

Mr. Duggan, do we know if anyone wants to

10

cross-examine Mr. Rule?

Because if nobody wants to cross-

11

examine him, it's possible we're all sitting here in a way

12

that could be short circuited.

13

I'm just tossing out a question to try to help.

14

MR. DUGGAN:

15

considering examining Mr. Rule.

16

continue to intend to do so.

THE COURT:

Forgive me for not knowing.

Some parties indicated that they were

Alternatively, we could just break for

18

lunch now and have him be ready at 2:15 and we'll pick up

19

then.

I think that's probably what we ought to do.

20

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, Brian Edmunds.

I would

21

just say that I have no intention of cross-examining him.

22

think we had put time down in case.

23
24

THE COURT:

Okay.

I

Was Mr. Edmunds the person you

were thinking of who might want to cross-examine?

25

MR. DUGGAN:

212-267-6868

Your Honor, he was one of several

parties that expressed a possibility.

2

THE COURT:

All right.

So why don't we just break

-- this is a good enough time to break for lunch as any.

24

MR. RULE:

25

THE COURT:

That’s correct.
Okay.

So, Mr. Rule, you submitted a

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 140
1

declaration dated August 5, 2021 to which your expert report

2

dated June 15, 2021 was attached.

3

submitted under my order establishing a confirmation

4

schedule and hearing protocols for this hearing knowing it

5

would be your direct testimony in this matter.

6

today on August 12th, is there anything in your expert

7

report that you would wish to change?

8

MR. RULE:

9

THE COURT:

10

That declaration was

Sitting here

No, Your Honor.
And, therefore, nothing in your

declaration that you wish to change?

11

MR. RULE:

12

THE COURT:

That’s correct.
Okay.

All right, does anyone object

13

to the admission of Mr. Rule’s declaration and the attached

14

expert report as his testimony regarding the expert analysis

15

of the so-called intercompany and noncash transfers?

16

All right, hearing no one, I will admit the

17

declaration and expert report and note that Mr. Rule is

18

therefore qualified as an expert in the accounting matters

19

detailed in his expert report.

20

Does anyone want to cross-examine Mr. Rule?

21

All right.

22

Underwood, did you want to?

23
24

No?

Mr. Rule, I’ve read your -- oh, I’m sorry, Mr.

Canadian -- Canadian entity’s website, they describe

themselves as being a part of the Mundipharma network of

A

Q

Sure.

ascertain whether it was conducted on an arm’s length basis?

5

simply to identify, quantify, and document the transfer.

8

not any third party would pay the sums exchanged between the

parties for the sale of that asset?

Are you aware of any reason for the transfer based upon

I don’t know exactly when they began.

Could you just repeat your question,

10

please?

11

Q

12

March of 2019?

13

A

I believe that they had been going back prior to that.

14

Q

And with whom were those discussions taking place?

15

A

There were groups -- besides the company and the

16

Sacklers -- and I’m going to refer to the Sackler Family and

17

the Sackler entities, which have been defined as the

18

Sacklers, if that’s okay for ease and convenience.

19

were also groups -- I think there was a -- the various

20

parties in the MDL litigation and others that had sub --

21

subgroups that were negotiating with the Debtors and the

22

Sacklers prior to the Chapter 11 filing.

23

Q

Were any of the states involved in those discussions?

24

A

It’s my understanding that they were part of those

25

groups that were involved in the discussions.

Certainly.

in your declaration, include the concept of the third party

release for the Sacklers of claims that the states and

4

others were starting or (indiscernible) against them?

5

A

I believe it did.

6

Q

And did the special -- the answer to this is probably

7

obvious, but did the special committee endorse pursuing the

8

settlement framework as a means of potentially resolving the

9

Chapter 11 cases?

10

A

I’m sorry, again, sir, you cut out in the middle.

17

all of the various claimants into one group under -- under

18

the auspices of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.

19

-- you know, when you say endorse, it was a -- a component

20

that helped us get that process started and a framework, but

it was by no means something that we said had to be done.

it was the framework that would help us continue to bring

all of the various creditor groups towards a decision as to

whether it was better to litigate against the Sacklers or

attempt to come up with a settlement that would be fair and

equitable for all the creditors of the Debtor’s estates.

The third party releases that you said were

contemplated to be part of the settlement framework, were

they contemplated to be just consensual releases?

contemplated in it.

15

third party releases were going to be considered as part of

that.

reorganization ready to be filed.

Sacklers that if they were going to post up X amount of

2

dollars -- and I believe at the time, the settlement

3

framework was somewhere around $3 billion or so -- that they

4

were going to seek broad third party releases, and releases

5

from the Debtors, releases of all the estate claims, etc.,

6

so that they could be able to put all of that -- all of the

I’m sorry, Mr. Goldman, could you repeat the question?

Yes.

say it was pretty obvious to us that those presentations

21

given by the Sackler Family advisers were very one-sided,

22

and we gave it, you know, the weight that it deserved,

23

which, in my opinion, was it was a very one-sided

24

presentation.

It was -- it was included, as I explained earlier in

And in Paragraph 33, you characterize those

determination was that the 4.275 billion that we would

go to the Sackler Families and Entities were part of that --

19

that it was still the settlement that is incorporated in the

So I would say it this way.

The -- as I mentioned

10

of advice every step of the process through this Chapter 11.

11

It has included discussions about this particular -- you

12

know, the issues you're talking about and it was all

factored into whether or not we felt the filing of a plan of

14

reorganization which would in essence take all of the value

15

of Purdue along with the settlement with the Sacklers and

16

turn it over to creditors for the benefit of all these

creditors was fair and equitable, and we believed that is

the case.

-- a creditor of the estate, they would have their

proportionate share of the value of this Chapter 11

considering whether to approve a settlement agreement,

right?

A

Yes, sir.

And as you sit here today, you don't recall, you know,

as one of those factors in this particular consideration,

I guess what I'm getting at is this.

MR. KAMINETZKY:

That's where I think the

22

confusion is, Your Honor, that settlement agreement -- Mr.

23

Dubel, he's -- you're talking about the plan settlement

agreement and I think counsel is referring to something

25

else.

I didn't mean to -- but I really -- that's why

THE COURT:

So, Mr. Dubel, what Mr. Ozment is

4

talking about is the DOJ settlement agreement/criminal plea

5

agreement -- that agreement -- that settlement.

6

question is, is the possibility of a restitution obligation

7

to victims of the criminal conduct that that agreement pleas

8

to -- was that possibility or that issue one of the issues

9

that was considered when the board considered agreeing to

10

And his

the DOJ plea agreement?

11

THE WITNESS:

Your Honor, I think -- the best way

12

I can answer is this, that to the extent that there were

13

creditors who might have claims against the company that are

14

being referenced by Mr. Ozment, that they would be part and

15

parcel of the overall plan of reorganization process and

16

part and parcel of the overall plan of reorganization

17

process was getting to be able to turn over the value of

18

Purdue -- the entity of Purdue -- along with the settlement

19

from the Sacklers for the benefit of all creditors and that

20

-- how that got divvied up was something that had been part

21

of the phase one mediation and, I think, you know,

22

ultimately, through the phase two mediation.

23

sure if that answers his question, but that -- I think I'm

24

trying to answer -- I'm trying to answer his question.

presumably if the U.S. Debtor is sued in Canada with regard

to actions that are taking place in Canada, based upon this

definition of the responsibilities of the special committee,

I would think that they would have to consider whether they

needed to bring a separate claim against this separate

What I'm talking about is the legal decisions that

were made here with regard to Purdue Canada insofar as there

is seemingly a determination -- and maybe not, maybe this

5

was seemingly a legal determination not to pursue indemnity

from Purdue Canada, but that's really the question, meaning

there were actions in Canada.

So to the extent that there

were any entities that are Sackler entities, which would be

IACs, et cetera, and to the extent that the entities that

Mr. Underwood is referring to are part of that, then it was

all considered as part of the overall settlement with the

what you considered with respect to the settlement, and you

described in the NOAT Trust and some of the private

Q

3

are called positive spillover effects of these abatement

4

programs.

5

A

Yes, I do.

6

Q

And by that, you mean investment in abatement programs

7

may have effects in other areas of each of the states in

8

their public and healthcare settings; is that right?

9

A

That's not right exactly.

10

Q

Okay.

11

A

So a positive spillover, as a general concept, really

12

relates to the concept of a public good being non-

13

excludable.

14

-- then there will be benefits to others.

15

I identified three sources of positive spillovers that can

16

result from this, abatement programs.

In Paragraph 52, which is on Page 22, you describe what

17

Do you see that?

Could you explain it to me?

That if one person consumes it, then that will

One of those sources is that if the abatement

18

programs, to the extent that they reduce opioid use

19

disorder, that may help other individuals who are also

20

struggling with opioid use disorder.

21

Another positive spillover is to the extent that

22

the abatement programs help medical providers, such as

23

physicians, in learning how to treat opioid use disorder,

24

this may help other medical providers because they might

25

learn from each other through (indiscernible) conferences or

1

informal settings.

2

And a third positive spillover that I identified

3

is that to the extent that these programs reduce the amount

4

that state governments, for instance, might have to spend on

5

treatment of OUD, or treatment of substance use disorder

6

more generally, or abatement of these conditions, that might

7

free up some state budgets, which might also generate

8

spillovers, for instance to other entities that a state

9

might help support, such as municipalities within the state.

10

Q

As a general matter, would you agree with me that the

11

investment in public abatement programs described by this

12

plan would have a benefit to the members of the public in

13

general, as well as to the constituent recipients of the

14

money?

15

A

16

the abatement programs that are proposed under the plan

17

would have benefits that would extend well beyond the

18

recipients of payouts under the plan.

argument.

21

can turn to that?

22

A

Almost.

Yes, I'm there.

about a lot of measures constituting public goods.

you've used it in your report?

So payments to states and municipalities to support

have aspects of the public good, as I discussed in my

had other things that fell under that rubric of public good.

Is that fair?

just to be clear, I investigated overall whether these

that in fact they do.

This is a deposition.

Let me ask this question.

Are the

I think what you're saying is that this question

10

has no bearing on the objection by Mr. Underwood's clients

11

to the plan< and therefore should be cut short.

12

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, that's also true.

We

13

made that point at the outset, that his objection is

14

entirely legal, and we've no sat here as he's questioned

15

witness after witness, and we haven't said a word.

16

know, the cost to abatement of this trial occasionally

17

necessitates an expression of our views about the propriety

18

of the examination.

19

But, you

These witnesses were all available to be deposed,

20

et cetera, and this is just -- you know, it's becoming a

21

little burdensome.

I don't mean to say more than that.

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

23

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I guess...

Your Honor, if I may, the

24

objection is based upon the categorization and the

25

classification of Canadian Municipal and First Nation's

creditors under this plan, and ultimately how they'll be

2

treated.

3

to no funding that is going to end up going to the creditors

4

I represent, and that they are not treated under the NOAT.

5

My understanding is right now that there's little

I think it's fair to ask the witness, who is

6

sitting on the stand, how there could possibly be spillover

7

into Canada from the -- and abatement that will be

8

effectuated in the U.S., but frankly, as far as I know, not

9

for municipalities or First Nations of Canada.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

11

MR. UNDERWOOD:

12

THE COURT:

That's a fair question --

And that's what my question --

That's a fair question to ask.

Sir,

13

are you aware of ways that there would be spillover benefit

14

to Canadian Municipalities, now knowing what you weren't

15

told before, that they would not be participating in the

16

NOAT Trust?

17

THE WITNESS:

18

THE COURT:

19

THE WITNESS:

20

THE COURT:

21

THE WITNESS:

Yes, I am.
Okay.
Should I answer how, or -Yes.
-- Your Honor -- yeah.

So one

22

example of this is that if there are -- part of the plans

23

include money that will go to providers to help them in

24

learning how to better treat opioid use disorder.

25

in Canada, physicians in Canada, often train in the United

3

Canada and the U.S. is very, very harmonized and common.

4

They go to medical conferences that
Medical licensing between

So, for those reasons, medical providers in Canada

5

would also learn through spillovers from conferences and

6

interactions with their colleagues in the United States

7

about how to better treat OUD as a result of (indiscernible)

8

programs.

9

Another example is that -- I had mentioned that

10

people are in networks and that if there is lower OUD

11

through abatement, or better uses of this, or better

12

treatment, better protocols to make sure that people do not

13

become -- do not contract opioid use disorder, then those

14

programs will also have spillovers.

15

United States often know people and our friends with people

16

in Canada.

17

People who live in the

The United States and Canada share an enormously

18

long border, the longest in the world.

And so that will

19

also create spillovers to Canadian Municipalities and First

20

Nations creditors.

had a couple questions for Mr. Gowrisankaran.

describe your understanding of the abatement procedures

under the NOAT in Paragraph 20 and Paragraph 21 of your

declaration.

25

with respect to the other trusts that deal with abatement,

Sir, you

Then you describe the procedures for abatement

like the NAS monitoring trust distribution, the Tribe trust

2

3

procedures, the TPP trust distribution procedures, the

4

donation to Truth Initiative Foundation.

5

descriptions in your declaration, correct?

6

THE WITNESS:

Yes, Your Honor.

You see all those

That's correct,

7

except Paragraph 20 is, I think, about the approved uses of

8

the trusts, not about the trust distribution procedures

9

themselves.

10

THE COURT:

That's fair.

So in one paragraph talk

11

about the uses, and then you talk about the procedures in

12

the other one, or the programs in the next paragraph.

13
14

THE WITNESS:

It's in the next

subsection under Page 10, on the top of this.

15

THE COURT:

about tribes.

18

You're correct.

19
20

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, actually -- sorry.

That's

I do talk about them in the next paragraph.

THE COURT:

Do you know who designed these

procedures and uses for the trusts?

21

THE WITNESS:

22

THE COURT:

I'm not aware who designed them, no.
Okay.

Would you think that they were

23

designed by bankruptcy professionals, as opposed to people

24

concerned with public health?

25

THE WITNESS:

212-267-6868

I wouldn't -- first of all, I don't

2

and industrial organization economist.

3

that the procedures look consistent with a design that

4

considers public health law.

5

consistent with how bankruptcy professionals would design

6

it.

7

THE COURT:

Okay.

I'm a healthcare economist,
So I can tell you

I really don't know if it's

And you used as a comparator,

8

expert reports from the litigations that you already

9

discussed during cross-examination in Washington and Ohio by

10

public health experts that also discussed opioid programs

11

and procedures?

12

There was a comparison to these?

THE WITNESS:

Well, that was -- I used them

13

specifically to say that there is supporting evidence that

14

the creditors in this matter value these programs.

15

THE COURT:

Okay.

And then, this is maybe a

16

broader question.

17

different ways that -- and these are my words, not yours --

18

the money that is spent on these programs and procedures and

19

policies has a multiplier factor, because of spillover and

20

because of public good, et cetera.

21

quantified that factor.

22

And if so, why were you not -- why did you quantify it?

23

Your declaration lists a number of

THE WITNESS:

Yet, you've not

Was that part of your assignment?

Oh.

So, Your Honor, first of all,

24

those are your words, but I would agree with them that the

25

programs have a multiplier factor.

212-267-6868

I think that's a fair

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 241
1

way of putting it.

2

I was asked, as my assignment, to understand

3

whether the programs, first of all, created value, and

4

second, whether the value extended beyond the creditors that

5

would directly receive payouts from the programs.

6

It was not part of my assignment to quantify how

7

big that multiplier was or how much value would be received

8

by any individual creditor or an aggregate, like creditors

9

who did not receive payouts, but rather just to opine on

10

whether there was a positive value beyond -- a positive

11

value in general and a positive value beyond the creditors

12

who will receive payouts from the programs.

13

THE COURT:

Okay.

Is that an exercise that can be

14

done, or is it in the development of public health economics

15

still too early to be able to do that type of calculation?

16

THE WITNESS:

I think it would be difficult to

17

quantify how much spillovers there are two other

18

individuals.

19

sources of spillovers that I discussed in response to the

20

first attorney who asked me questions.

21

types of spillovers are definitely there; they're present.

22

That would require quantifying these three

And those three

But understanding, for instance, how much a state

23

government would be able to contribute more money to

24

municipalities and if some of its budget were freed up

25

because of the NOAT trust, seems to be fairly difficult to

she'll be connecting shortly.

We will...

She's trying desperately to get in.

MS. MARKMAN GOSTIN:

I'm from Wilmer Hale, on

Right.
As the Debtors said, we are

15

indeed working on a stipulation to hopefully resolve our

motion in limine with respect to Mr. DelConte.

17

just ask that if he does take the stand today, our rights to

18

address our motion in limine at a later time be reserved.

THE COURT:

Yeah, that's fine.

That's fine.

That's where I was headed.

My question was, what role, if any,

did Ms. Greenspan have in the creation of the trust

None.

MR. TOBAK:

I don't want to say any more, but yes.

THE COURT:

Well, I

would like to get her under oath, but that could wait until

tomorrow, if you want to move to Mr. DelConte instead.

MR. TOBAK:

Your Honor, just -- would you want us

to -- pursuant to your procedures, if there's a technical

breakdown, we're allowed to -- you're allowed to do this by

MR. DELCONTE:

MR. TOBAK:

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Mr. DelConte --

Yeah.

-- please drop.
Your Honor, just for the -- one

8

second.

For the benefit of others, just so the public is

9

aware, we're sequestering each witness.

And the reason for

10

these complexities is that for sort of having the most clean

11

and appropriate process, no witness is allowed to listen --

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. HUEBNER:

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. HUEBNER:

Right.
-- to any other witness's testimony.
Right.
And they have to be sort of locked

16

away somewhere until out of the blue recalled and say, right

17

now dial in, which is also why Mr. DelConte is dropping.

18

we are obviously very sorry about this, but it is actually

19

necessitated by --

MR. HUEBNER:

22

Right.
-- trying to ensure and unusually

clean process --

It is 5:20, and hopefully, the DelConte issues can get

resolved overnight.

either have witnesses where we can in a different location,

4

and frankly, just suboptimal.

5

We just don't understand why this is

Obviously, the witnesses have all the

So I think if it meets with the Court's approval,

6

I think probably, unless we can find Ms. Greenspan in the

7

next two minutes, let's just call it a day.

technologically, and hopefully, today will be the only day

10

We will work

where we keep having these complexities.

11

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Well, that's fine.

12

I mean, we could go with Mr. DelConte too, but I don't know

13

whether there's going to be extensive cross of him or not.

14

So we could pick up tomorrow morning at 10:00 with both of

15

them.
