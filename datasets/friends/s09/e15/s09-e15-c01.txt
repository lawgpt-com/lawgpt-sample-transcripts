Chandler Bing: Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Monica Geller: Really? Let's get past the moment.
Phoebe Buffay: What's your news?
Chandler Bing: Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
Monica Geller: Oh, honey, that's incredible!
Phoebe Buffay: Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
Chandler Bing: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Chandler Bing: Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
Ross Geller: So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Chandler Bing: Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
Phoebe Buffay: That's great.

Monica Geller: Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Ross Geller: Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!
