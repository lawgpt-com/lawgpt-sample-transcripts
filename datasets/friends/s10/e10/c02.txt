Rachel Green: You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, how cute!
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Rachel Green: Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
Rachel Green: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
Phoebe Buffay: OH! He's having an affair.
Rachel Green: He's not having an affair!
Phoebe Buffay: You know, I'm always right about these things.
Rachel Green: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Rachel Green: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
Chandler Bing: Hello.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Chandler Bing: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Chandler Bing: Those are all really old!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Rachel Green: "Dude, Where's My Car?"
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Rachel Green: They're in a caaar...
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Rachel Green: Geez!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Rachel Green: Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
Phoebe Buffay: I got them!
