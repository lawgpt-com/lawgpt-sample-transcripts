Rachel Green: Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Do you remember where the duck food is?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Rachel Green: Because I'm going to London.
Phoebe Buffay: What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Rachel Green: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Phoebe Buffay: But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Rachel Green: Yeah, that didn't work.
Phoebe Buffay: I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Rachel Green: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Phoebe Buffay: That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Rachel Green: Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Phoebe Buffay: No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Rachel Green: Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Phoebe Buffay: I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
