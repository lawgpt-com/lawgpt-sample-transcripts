Monica Geller: So to get this part you can't be?
Joey Tribbiani: Nope.
Monica Geller: But you are?
Joey Tribbiani: Yep.
Monica Geller: But you told them you weren't?
Joey Tribbiani: That's right.
Monica Geller: Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Monica Geller: Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Joey Tribbiani: I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Monica Geller: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Joey Tribbiani: I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Monica Geller: Unless!
Joey Tribbiani: Unless what?
Monica Geller: Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Joey Tribbiani: Like what?
Monica Geller: Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
