Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no, not you too!
Phoebe Buffay: No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Joey Tribbiani: Nice!
Phoebe Buffay: Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Joey Tribbiani: That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Joey Tribbiani: You do?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
