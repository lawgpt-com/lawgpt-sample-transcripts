Chandler Bing: Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
Wendy: Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
Chandler Bing: Ah. Thanks.
Wendy: Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Chandler Bing: Ah. Chandler Bing.
