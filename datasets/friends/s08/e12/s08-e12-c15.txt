Rachel Green: Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Joey Tribbiani: Alone?!
Rachel Green: Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
Rachel Green: No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh uh, it didn't work out.
Rachel Green: Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Rachel Green: Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh sure, yeah, why not?
Rachel Green: Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
Joey Tribbiani: All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
Rachel Green: Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
Joey Tribbiani: Terrified.
