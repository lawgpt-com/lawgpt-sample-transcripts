Ross Geller: So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Ross Geller: Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay: But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Ross Geller: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ross Geller: Ohh, this cake is really good!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!

Guest #3: Yeah, leave!
#ALL#: Yeah, get out! Now!
Steve Cera: Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Phoebe Buffay: All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
