Woman: Comin' through. Move, move.
Rachel Green: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Woman: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Rachel Green: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Woman: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Rachel Green: What?
Woman: No suds, no save. Ok?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: What's goin' on?
Rachel Green: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Ross Geller: Was your basket on top?
Rachel Green: Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Ross Geller: So?
Rachel Green: Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Ross Geller: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Woman: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Ross Geller: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Rachel Green: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Ross Geller: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: What's that?
Ross Geller: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Rachel Green: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Ross Geller: Rach, have you never done this before?
Rachel Green: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Ross Geller: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Rachel Green: Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Ross Geller: Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
