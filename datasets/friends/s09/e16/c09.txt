Phoebe Buffay: Hi.
Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Ross Geller: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Phoebe Buffay: No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Ross Geller: Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Ross Geller: Never?
Phoebe Buffay: Never.
Ross Geller: wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Phoebe Buffay: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
Ross Geller: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Phoebe Buffay: That's not how you really feel is it?
Ross Geller: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Phoebe Buffay: Seriously? You divorce-o?
Ross Geller: If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay: It's ok that's how you feel.
Ross Geller: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
Phoebe Buffay: I do love Mike.
Ross Geller: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Ross Geller: The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Phoebe Buffay: It's not cooler.
Ross Geller: Yeah I just hurt it.
