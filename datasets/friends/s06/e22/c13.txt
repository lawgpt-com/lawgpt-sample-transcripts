Rachel Green: Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Ross Geller: And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Paul Stevens: Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Elizabeth Stevens: Daddy!
Paul Stevens: You're next!!
Elizabeth Stevens: Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Paul Stevens: Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Ross Geller: Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
Paul Stevens: No, let me explain! Fired!!
Ross Geller: All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Paul Stevens: What?
Ross Geller: And I too am just a love machine.
Paul Stevens: Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
