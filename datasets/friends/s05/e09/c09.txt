Chandler Bing: Ross?
Ross Geller: Hey Chandler. Monica!
Monica Geller: Ross, are you okay?
Ross Geller: I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Monica Geller: Why?!
Ross Geller: On account of my rage.
Chandler Bing: Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Ross Geller: He gave me a pill for it.
Monica Geller: A pill?
Ross Geller: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Monica Geller: Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Chandler Bing: And you're okay with that?
Ross Geller: I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
