Joey Tribbiani: This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Chandler Bing: It's 6:00.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, well...
Rachel Green: Hi!
Chandler Bing: Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Rachel Green: Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Chandler Bing: What?
Rachel Green: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Rachel Green: Why not?
Chandler Bing: Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Ross Geller: Hey man.
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Ross Geller: So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Chandler Bing: Nothing.
Rachel Green: Nothing.
Joey Tribbiani: I am... free!
Ross Geller: Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Chandler Bing: What?!
Ross Geller: Yep!
Rachel Green: In a month?
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Rachel Green: You mean, you mean 30 days?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: From now?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Well, that's great.
Ross Geller: Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
