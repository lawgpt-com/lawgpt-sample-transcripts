Monica Geller: Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Chandler Bing: I know.
Monica Geller: You gave my father a lap dance!
Chandler Bing: Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ross Geller: 'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Chandler Bing: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Phoebe Buffay: Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Chandler Bing: Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Ross Geller: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Monica Geller: Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Chandler Bing: I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Ross Geller: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Monica Geller: I wasn't escaping.
Ross Geller: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Monica Geller: I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Ross Geller: You were trying to eat it!
