Ross Geller: Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
Gunther: Diapers huh?
Ross Geller: Yep.
Gunther: So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Ross Geller: Yep, can you believe it?
Gunther: Nope! I still can't believe she slept with you in the first place.
Ross Geller: Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
Ross Geller: Ah actually we don't.
Joey Tribbiani: Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
Ross Geller: What! You didn't do anything wrong?!
Joey Tribbiani: I said I didn't technically.
Ross Geller: Okay let's put aside that you "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
Ross Geller: And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
Joey Tribbiani: I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
Ross Geller: Not using it right, Joe.
Ross Geller: I'm gonna go.
Joey Tribbiani: No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
Ross Geller: Give me the bag.
Joey Tribbiani: No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
Ross Geller: Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Ross Geller: I'm not gonna hit you.
Joey Tribbiani: Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Ross Geller: No I don't.
Joey Tribbiani: A little bit.
Ross Geller: No.
Joey Tribbiani: Little bit.
Ross Geller: No!
Joey Tribbiani: A little bit more.
Ross Geller: Give me the bag.
Joey Tribbiani: No, hit me.
Ross Geller: Give me the bag.
Joey Tribbiani: Hit me.
Ross Geller: Joey, give me the bag.
Joey Tribbiani: Hit me!
Ross Geller: Joe I'm not kidding.
Joey Tribbiani: Hit me, hit me.
Ross Geller: No!
Joey Tribbiani: Hit me! Hit me!
Ross Geller: You ducked!!
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
Ross Geller: Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Joey Tribbiani: I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Ross Geller: What is the matter with you?!?
Joey Tribbiani: You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
Ross Geller: Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Joey Tribbiani: Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
