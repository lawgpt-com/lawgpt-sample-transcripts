Chandler Bing: Hey.
Ross Geller: Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Chandler Bing: What?!
Ross Geller: Unagi. I'm always aware.
Chandler Bing: Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Ross Geller: What's up?
Chandler Bing: I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Ross Geller: Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Chandler Bing: I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Ross Geller: Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Ross Geller: Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Chandler Bing: Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Ross Geller: Why not?
Chandler Bing: Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Ross Geller: Oh.
