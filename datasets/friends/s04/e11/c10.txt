Phoebe Buffay: My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Rachel Green: Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Monica Geller: Y'know, I never saw that.
Rachel Green: Ooh, it was only okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Alice Knight: Hi!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Hi!
Alice Knight: Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
Alice Knight: None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, who's this little guy?!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Alice Knight: You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, why don't you?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Are you serious?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh, yeah!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, thanks.
Monica Geller: What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay: No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Alice Knight: Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
Monica Geller: It's gonna be so great.
Phoebe Abbott: Hi! What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Phoebe Abbott: But Phoebe...
Phoebe Buffay: No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Phoebe Abbott: Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh!
