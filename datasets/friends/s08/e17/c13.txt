Rachel Green: Hi.
Joey Tribbiani: So? What-what-what happened?
Rachel Green: It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
Chandler Bing: Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
Rachel Green: Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Chandler Bing: Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: I'll be in there.
Rachel Green: Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...
Joey Tribbiani: I know. I know.
Rachel Green: It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
Rachel Green: Yeah I know! I miss that.
Joey Tribbiani: Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
