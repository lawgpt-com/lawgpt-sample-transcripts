Monica Geller: You're kidding?! That's great!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Monica Geller: Oh my.
Joey Tribbiani: Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Chandler Bing: I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Rachel Green: Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Chandler Bing: That's what you say at the end of a date.
Rachel Green: You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Chandler Bing: To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Monica Geller: Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Rachel Green: Well, they always called.
Monica Geller: Hmm, bite me.
