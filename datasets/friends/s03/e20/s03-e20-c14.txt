Chandler Bing: It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.

Joanna: It was, wasn't it?
Chandler Bing: The food there was, was great.
Joanna: Wasn't it?
Chandler Bing: So take care.
Joanna: You too.
Chandler Bing: Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.

Rachel Green: Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Chandler Bing: Noo!
Rachel Green: Chandler!!
Chandler Bing: Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Rachel Green: Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Chandler Bing: Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Joanna: What?
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Joanna: Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, o-okay.
Joanna: So...
Chandler Bing: Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
