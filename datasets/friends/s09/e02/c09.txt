Chandler Bing: Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
Ms. Mckenna: What?
Chandler Bing: It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
Ms. Mckenna: You fell asleep?
Chandler Bing: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
Ms. Mckenna: Chandler, I.
Chandler Bing: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
