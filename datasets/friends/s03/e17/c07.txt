Carol Willick: Hey, what are you doing here?
Ross Geller: Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Carol Willick: Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Ross Geller: Where's Ben?
Carol Willick: He's sleeping.
Ross Geller: Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Carol Willick: Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Ross Geller: Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Carol Willick: It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ross Geller: Ah! Oh.
Carol Willick: Sooo!! Anyway...
Ross Geller: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Carol Willick: Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Ross Geller: Yeah, well.
Carol Willick: Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Ross Geller: Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Carol Willick: Oh, great! Me too.
Ross Geller: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
