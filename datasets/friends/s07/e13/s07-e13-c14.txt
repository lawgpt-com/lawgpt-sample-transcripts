Monica Geller: Hey guys! Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey.
Monica Geller: Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Jack Geller: That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Ross Geller: Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Monica Geller: Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Ross Geller: Well, these. These are yours right here.
Monica Geller: Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Ross Geller: Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Monica Geller: Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Ross Geller: Nu-uh!
Monica Geller: Oh, an old glove?
Jack Geller: Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Monica Geller: Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Ross Geller: Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Monica Geller: This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Ross Geller: Umm, your boxes are umm...
Monica Geller: What?
Ross Geller: Dad?
Jack Geller: Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
Monica Geller: Just mine?
Jack Geller: I'm afraid so.
Monica Geller: So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Jack Geller: Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Monica Geller: So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Jack Geller: There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
Monica Geller: I can't believe this!
Jack Geller: Screw it! I'm having one.
