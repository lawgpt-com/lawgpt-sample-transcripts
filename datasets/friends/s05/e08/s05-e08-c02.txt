Joey Tribbiani: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Chandler Bing: Are you aware that you're still talking?
Monica Geller: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Ross Geller: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Ross Geller: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Chandler Bing: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Rachel Green: Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Ross Geller: Oh God, no.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Chandler Bing: It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
