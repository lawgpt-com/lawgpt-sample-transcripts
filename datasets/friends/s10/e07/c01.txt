Ross Geller: Hey you guys!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey, what are you doing?
Mike Hannigan: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Chandler Bing: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Chandler Bing: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
Phoebe Buffay: So what did you two do about it?
Chandler Bing: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Ross Geller: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Mike Hannigan: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
Ross Geller: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Phoebe Buffay: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Mike Hannigan: Are you serious?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
Mike Hannigan: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
Ross Geller: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Chandler Bing: Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Ross Geller: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
