Rachel Green: Oh, hi Danny.
Danny: Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Monica Geller: Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Rachel Green: Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Monica Geller: You are?
Rachel Green: Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Danny: Yeah, what's the gala for?
Rachel Green: It's a uh, regatta gala.
Danny: Really! You-you sail?
Rachel Green: No-no, but I support it.
Danny: Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Danny: Take care.
Rachel Green: Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Monica Geller: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Rachel Green: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Monica Geller: Great. So the ball is in his court?
Rachel Green: Ball? There is no ball.
