Chandler Bing: Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Chandler Bing: No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Monica Geller: Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Chandler Bing: I don't do that.
Chandler Bing: I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Today is the sixth.
Monica Geller: No, it's not.
Chandler Bing: Yes, it's also 2003.
Monica Geller: Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Chandler Bing: It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Chandler Bing: Tough crib.
Monica Geller: Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Chandler Bing: I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Monica Geller: Chandler!
Chandler Bing: I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
