Joey Tribbiani: Morning!
Rachel Green: Oh right.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Rachel Green: Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Joey Tribbiani: Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Rachel Green: Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Joey Tribbiani: No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Rachel Green: God I'm just a horrible person.
Joey Tribbiani: Wh-why?
Rachel Green: Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Joey Tribbiani: That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Rachel Green: Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Joey Tribbiani: Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Rachel Green: The ring from the cave, yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Rachel Green: Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Joey Tribbiani: Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Rachel Green: No! No-no-no...
Joey Tribbiani: Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Rachel Green: But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Rachel Green: Yeah!
