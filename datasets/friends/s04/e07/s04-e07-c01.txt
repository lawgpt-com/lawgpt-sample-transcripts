Ross Geller: Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Chandler Bing: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows.

I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
