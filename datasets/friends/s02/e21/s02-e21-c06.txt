Joey Tribbiani: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I don't know.
Rachel Green: What's the matter?
Phoebe Buffay: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Rachel Green: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Phoebe Buffay: What was that?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
