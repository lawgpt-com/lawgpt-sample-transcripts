Ross Geller: Rach!
Rachel Green: Hey you!
Ross Geller: Hey, come on in.
Rachel Green: Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Ross Geller: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Rachel Green: Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Ross Geller: I guess so.
Rachel Green: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Ross Geller: Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Rachel Green: Exactly.
Ross Geller: Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Rachel Green: What? Who?
Ross Geller: Phoebe.
Rachel Green: Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Ross Geller: Ohh, I don't think so.
Rachel Green: Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Ross Geller: That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
