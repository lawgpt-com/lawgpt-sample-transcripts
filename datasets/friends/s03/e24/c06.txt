Rachel Green: Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Phoebe Buffay: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Bonnie: Hi!
Rachel Green: This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Bonnie: I can show you an ID if you want?
Rachel Green: Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Bonnie: Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Rachel Green: Oh, that must be it.

Rachel Green: You said she was bald.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Rachel Green: How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Rachel Green: Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Phoebe Buffay: Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Rachel Green: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Rachel Green: Why, does she have a bad personality?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
