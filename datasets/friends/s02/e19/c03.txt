Estelle Leonard: Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Joey Tribbiani: So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Estelle Leonard: Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
Joey Tribbiani: No, can we get back to me?
Estelle Leonard: Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright. Cab driver number two?
Estelle Leonard: You're welcome.
Joey Tribbiani: But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Estelle Leonard: Things change, roll with em.
Joey Tribbiani: But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Estelle Leonard: Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sorry. See ya.
