Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
Monica Geller: Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Monica Geller: They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Phoebe Buffay: They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Rachel Green: Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
Monica Geller: Oh God, neither!
Monica Geller: I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Rachel Green: Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
Monica Geller: You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Rachel Green: Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Monica Geller: I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Rachel Green: Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
Phoebe Buffay: So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Rachel Green: Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
Monica Geller: She said WHAT?
Phoebe Buffay: That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!
