THE COURT:

Good morning, everyone.

This is Judge

3

Drain and we are here in In re Purdue Pharma L.P.

4

the amended agenda for this hearing.

5

for a while now as the pretrial conference for the

6

confirmation hearing on the Debtor’s amended Chapter 11

7

plan, which is scheduled to start on August 12th.

8
9

I have

It has been scheduled

In addition, the first item on the agenda is the
Debtor’s motion to shorten notice and the underlying motion

10

that that motion relates to, which is a stipulation with

11

Canadian governmental claimants, namely the provincial

12

governments of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,

13

Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and

14

Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Manitoba, and

15

the objection to those requests for relief by certain local

16

governmental -- Canadian governmental claimants and for its

17

people’s representatives and the Debtor’s reply.

18

So I expect the vast majority of people on the

19

call are here for the pretrial conference, but I’m happy to

20

go in the order of the agenda.

21

MR. ROBERTSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

22

morning.

23

Wardwell on behalf of (indiscernible).

Good

For the record, Chris Robertson, Davis, Polk &

THE COURT:

We’re turning you up.

I don’t see

anyone else on the call looking like they can’t hear you.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 36

So you can go ahead.

2

MR. ROBERTSON:

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

3

Before we turn to the confirmation and pretrial conference,

4

I do note there is one contested matter on the agenda, which

5

is the proof of stipulation order by and among the debtors,

6

the Canadian provincial governments, the claimants, and

7

Sackler families.

8

Honor.

I will try to do this briefly, Your

9

Your Honor, before addressing the stipulation

10

itself, we should address the motion to shorten notice.

11

Debtors filed a stipulation and order and the motion to

12

shorten on July 28th, which was 12 days ago.

13

stipulation and order is a settlement of claims that causes

14

action against the debtors, we understand that Bankruptcy

15

Rule 2002(a)(3) would ordinarily require 21 days’ notice to

16

parties in interest.

17

The

Because the

However, as we submit in our motion to shorten and

18

in our reply, we believe that entry of the stipulation and

19

order does not adversely affect any creditor and we believe

20

that no credit should have a legitimate issue that would

21

necessitate delay in having this hearing.

22

We and the Canadian governmental claimants also

23

have a desire to have a stipulation and order occur at or

24

prior to confirmation because it relates to and narrows the

25

scope of third-party releases and resolves potential

Page 37

objections to confirmation from the Canadian Governmental

2

Claimants.

3

notice provided is sufficient and appropriate.

4

here in case counsel would like to speak on the shorten on

5

behalf of the municipal and first nation creditors.

6

Under the circumstances, we believe that the

THE COURT:

I will pause

Well, before we hear from them, let me

7

ask you, what is the difference between hearing this today

8

and hearing it on the 12th?

9

MR. ROBERTSON:

Your Honor, I don’t think that

10

there is any major difference.

When we scheduled this

11

motion for hearing, the confirmation hearing was still

12

scheduled to begin today.

13

immediately prior to confirmation.

14

time available for the 9th, we thought it was appropriate to

15

keep this matter on the agenda rather than moving it to the

16

12th.

And so this was commenced
However, as we had Court

And we have obviously other matters to address.

17

THE COURT:

Okay.

The reason I’m asking is that

18

at least I believe, although I only see about five percent

19

of what’s going in the case, literally, but based upon all

20

of the pleadings that were filed recently, I believe that

21

many parties in interest in this case may have been focusing

22

on that as opposed to really focusing on this motion.

23

Indeed, the limited objection filed to the motion

24

suggests that the parties have not really thought it through

25

very much, and a few more days might give people a little

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 38
1

more time to focus on it.

2

MR. ROBERTSON:

Your Honor, to that point I think

3

I would only add that although the stipulation was filed on

4

that there will be any further objections to this

14

regarding timing, we think it’s appropriate certainly for

the Court to hear the stipulation today.

16

concerns about this matter spilling into the date of the

17

confirmation hearing for the following reason.

18

And we have

On July 28th at Docket 3335, the Canadian

19

provinces filed a reservation of rights with respect to

20

confirmation of the Debtor’s sixth amended plan.

21

that, the Canadian provinces referenced a stipulation

22

represent, A, that it was the product of extensive arm’s

23

length negotiations, but that it also resolves the general

24

objections that are set forth in the reservation of rights

25

as well as other objections that the Canadian provinces

have.

2

as to whether or not the stipulation will ultimately be

3

approved by the Court and when those objections could be

4

put, you know, publicly available and made available to the

5

Court for reviews to ensure that the debtors are aware of

6

the full, you know, scope of the objections, I think it

7

makes sense for the Court to hear the stipulation in advance

8

of the confirmation hearing so the Canadian provinces aren’t

9

jammed up and have to assert objections in the event that

10

And rather than leave the Canadian provinces in limbo

the Court does not approve to stipulate.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

Thank

you.

13

MR. KARAVOLAS:

THE COURT:

That’s understandable.

Thank you, Your Honor.

So why don’t I hear from the Canadian

objectors.

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Good morning, Your Honor.

18

municipalities as well as the class of Canadian first

20

THE COURT:

Can I interrupt you on that point?

21

How are you representing a class as opposed to the

22

individual entities that are named in the objection?

23

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Well, I would say there’s two

24

issues related to that.

25

individual entities who filed actions.

212-267-6868

This is

And my
And I think

10

this goes back to the larger issue, which is actually

11

outlined in the limited opposition that we filed here, which

12

is simply that the Canadian creditors came to this Court,

13

they came to the United States, they filed their proofs of

14

claim.

15

Whether we’re talking about individual

16

municipalities or class proofs and whether we’re talking

17

about municipalities, or whether we’re talking about first

nations, they filed their claims and they expected to be

19

part of this process.

20

process, I mean the (indiscernible) process with regard to

21

municipalities and first nations.

22

They were not.

And when I say this

And so ultimately here we are today.

And I think

23

ultimately with regard to this objection, or limited

24

objection to the stipulation, the concern that I have is

25

that what is being proposed is effectively a withdrawal of

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 42

$60 billion worth of Canadian sovereign claims.

2

material, and on its face it would be hard to suggest that

3

that would not be beneficial for a U.S. Debtor.

4

And that’s

My concern is what it may suggest in a larger

5

perspective with regard to the process that is going on here

6

and what’s the motivation for the Canadian provinces to

7

withdraw such significant claims that I am sure are backed

8

by -- that are real claims.

9

And the problem being I think there’s -- what it

10

suggests to me is that the Canadian provinces, in order to

11

avoid the risk of what may be arguably over-broad third

12

party releases, would rather withdraw from U.S. jurisdiction

13

than be a part of this bankruptcy process.

14

think that that is -- I don’t think that’s a good path for

15

any court to follow.

16

is that in fact what this Court is working towards is a

17

global resolution, to the extent that’s achievable, and

18

finality in further disputes in other jurisdictions about

19

the extent to which any provisions of any confirmed plan

20

apply.

14

objected to confirmation of the plan audit and therefore the

15

parties who I believe will be most interested in this motion

16

have objected to the Debtor’s request to shorten time.

17

as far as the one objection, it really does go primarily to

18

the merits, and there is a well-thought-out written

objection to the merits, which has just been addressed by

underlying relief and of course read the objection itself.

I’ve also read the Debtor’s reply, but I’m happy to hear

MR. ROBERTSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Again,

10

this is Christopher Robertson, Davis, Polk & Wardwell, on

11

12

Turning to stipulation and order, we believe that

13

entry of the stipulation is clearly in the best interest of

14

the Debtor’s estate.

Very briefly, Your Honor.

The aggregate asserted claim amount is about $85.5

The Canadian governmental claimants’ claims

7

against the debtors are complex and litigation would entail

8

complicated legal and factual issues, including with respect

9

to causation.

10

However, the Debtors understand that in the

11

context of these cases, the Canadian governmental claimants

12

are principally concerned with reserving their rights as

13

against the Canadian IACs and the Sacklers for claims

14

unrelated to the U.S. debtors.

15

The stipulation and order gives the Canadian

16

governmental claimants comfort that their rights will be

17

preserved as against the Canadian IACs and Sacklers

18

(indiscernible) continuing claims in the stipulation and it

19

gives the debtors and other creditors comfort that estate

resources will not be expended in litigating the Canadian

MR. KARAVOLAS:

Thank you, Your Honor,

Nicholas

11

Karavolas again for the Canadian provincial creditors.

12

The Canadian municipalities and first nation

13

creditors’ objection, which is styled as a limited objection

14

and reservation of rights, should be overruled for a number

15

of reasons, not least of which is that it questions the

16

motives of the parties, particularly the Canadian provinces,

17

in entering into the stipulation based solely on conjecture

18

and speculation.

19

We can assure Your Honor that the terms and

20

provisions of the stipulation are the product of extensive,

21

challenging, at times tedious arm’s length negotiations

22

between the debtors, the shareholders, and the Canadian

23

provinces, the discussion of which actually commenced in and

24

around November of 2020 and the drafting of which started in

25

late April of this year.

Contrary to the unsupported allegations of the

And the concept of assuring that the claims of non-

The provinces desire this

10

Drafting this concept into the stipulation was no easy task

11

and took a lot of work, but eventually the parties reached

12

terms that they were comfortable with and submitted them to

13

the Court for approval.

14

The Debtors clearly expressed the benefit to the

15

estates.

And as stated in our reservation of rights, the

16

stipulation resolves the provinces, you know, multitude of

17

objections to plan confirmation.

18

The terms of the stipulation we believe are clear.

19

They do not intend to nor do they affect the rights of other

20

creditors or the claims of other creditors.

21

accordingly, Your Honor, we respectfully request that the

22

Court approve the stipulation.

23

THE COURT:

24

I just want to confirm.

25

Okay, very well.

And

Thank you.

As far as the debtors are

concerned, what are the debtors giving up under this

stipulation?

2

counsel.

3

I guess that’s a question for the Debtor’s

MR. ROBERTSON:

Your Honor, I think from the

4

Debtor’s perspective, the answer is very little, if

5

anything.

6

The stipulation also includes a release of those claims that

7

the plaintiffs hold against the estate.

8
9

Claims are being withdrawn against the estate.

I think the reason why we engaged in these
negotiations for so long with the provincial governments --

10

Mr. Underwood, could you go on mute?

11

there’s a lot of feedback, and I think it may be because

12

more than one person other than the Court is not on mute at

13

the time.

14
15

Because

I apologize for interrupting, but I assume people
are having the same feedback problem I am.

16

MR. ROBERTSON:

Thank you, Marshall.

17

Part of the negotiations here, I think a lot of

18

the negotiations here were really around having the

19

opportunity for the provincial governments to participate in

20

the process of refining the plan releases in a way that

21

works for them and incorporates the stipulation.

22

So I think from the Debtor’s perspective, this is

23

really as straightforward as $60 billion of claims are being

24

withdrawn to no cost to the estate and it avoids future

25

litigation over the plan and over the claims.

the following sense.

subject them to the exposure of potential liability in

guess could conceivably mean there would be less money to

collect or fund the settlement that’s in this plan.

The agreement, which is also agreed to

But on

10

the other hand, the provinces would not be looking to that

11

money in the plan before me.

12

MR. ROBERTSON:

Is that a fair summary?

I think that is a fair summary,

13

Your Honor.

And I would only add that, I think it’s

14

obvious, we were negotiating the stipulation with the

15

backdrop of ultimate recognition of the plan and

16

confirmation (indiscernible) Canada.

oversimplification of the stipulation.

motion by the debtors for approval of a stipulation and

12

agreed order by and among them and the Canadian governmental

13

claimants, i.e. the provincial governments listed in the

14

stipulation, as well as representatives of Beacon Company

15

and the Raymond Sackler family which would resolve the

16

Canadian provincial claimants’ claims in this or these

17

Chapter 11 cases by the withdrawal of those claims and the

18

agreement that would be reflected not only in the

19

stipulation, but in any plan confirmed in these Chapter 11

20

cases that the non-debtor or non-province parties to the

21

stipulation would be subject to the terms of the

22

stipulation, including the modification of the proposed

23

third-party injunction and third-party claim release under

24

the debtor’s plan in these cases as narrowed by Paragraph 2

25

of the proposed stipulation.

212-267-6868

Which would, in narrowing the

proposed release, create a carveout from the release of the

The standard for approval of such an agreement, a

settlement, is well-established.

The settlement needs to be

fair and equitable and in the best interest of the debtor’s

lowest range of reasonableness, taking into account various

factors, including the merits of litigation that would ensue

if the settlement was not entered into in relation to the

benefits of the settlement, the potential duration, expense

12

of such litigation, the interest of creditors, including

13

whether other parties-in-interest affirmatively support the

14

settlements, the competency and experience of counsel

But to me, that is a clear tradeoff that is

13

There’s really no argument to the contrary in the

14

one objection that was filed to the request for approval of

15

the settlement, which was filed by certain non-provincial

16

governmental claimants and first nation creditors that have

17

filed proofs of claim in these Chapter 11 cases.

18

those objectors question the benefits to the non-debtor

19

parties to the settlement, namely the Canadian provinces,

20

which is not my purview to consider under the authorities

21

that I have previously cited.

primarily

22

I trust, however, that as the conglomeration of

23

all of the Canadian provinces, represented by capable and

24

sophisticated counsel, they have considered and acted

There is a suggestion in the objection that

7

somehow this settlement might create a problem in

10

given for that other than questioning the provinces’

11

judgement.

12

13

Although, again, that judgement is not

In any event, it appears to me that the settlement

14

actually thoughtfully addresses the rights of the Canadian

15

provinces, both here and in Canada, and the debtor’s rights

16

in relation to the Canadian provinces’ rights in Canada and

17

in these cases.

18

I will also note that the stipulation is quite

19

clear that the parties’ agreement does not affect the rights

20

of any other parties in interest in these Chapter 11 cases,

21

including, without limitation, the objectors to this motion,

22

who can still pursue their objections to the Debtor’s

23

Chapter 11 plan and any other Chapter 11 plan filed in these

24

cases.

25

So I will so order the stipulation granting the

So on Thursday afternoon, August 5th, the Debtors

516-608-2400

Page 59
1

and certain plan supporters filed their respective briefs in

2

support of confirmation and in response to the objection.

3

Along with their brief, the debtors filed seven face

4

declarations which serve as those witness’ direct testimony.

5

The Debtors have previously served their expert

6

reports, that is their experts’ direct testimony, around

7

June 15th, almost eight weeks ago.

8
9

As far as the other plan supporters, the UCC, the
AHC, the MSGE, the various ad hoc groups of individual

10

victims and of hospitals and of NAS children and of both

11

sides of the Sackler family, in addition to their briefs,

12

collectively filed 13 fact declarations which supplemented

13

their collective 12 expert reports, none of which were

14

served later than a month ago.

15

Finally -- I’m sorry?

Finally, the objecting

16

parties filed just one fact declaration which was filed by

17

Marilyn on Friday per an extension that we happily granted.

18

Now, the Debtors immediately compiled all of this

19

information on each of these potential witnesses and on

20

Friday morning reached out to each of the objectors and

21

supporters and asked for each parties’ estimate of how much

22

cross-examination time they would need with each witness.

23

You requested responses by noon on Sunday.

24

forget, I want to thank each of the parties for their

25

cooperation.

212-267-6868

And before I

This was a grueling schedule and process and

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 60
1

we all are working literally around the clock, including

2

nights, weekends, et cetera.

3

I’m not exaggerating when I say that we were

4

literally floored by the responses we received to our

5

outreach.

6

last night, taking the low end of these estimates, the

7

parties estimate over 164 hours of time, or assuming seven

8

on-the-record hours a day, roughly 23-and-a-half days just

9

for witness testimony.

As detailed in the chart we sent to Your Honor

If you add 25 percent to this for

10

redirect, recross, and any questions from the Court, which

11

we believe is probably a conservative estimate, that comes

12

to approximately 205 hours and over 29 trial days just of

13

evidence.

14

The objecting states of Connecticut, Maryland,

15

Oregon, and Washington account for 137 of the 164 hours we

16

just discussed, or almost 84 percent of the total requested

17

time.

18

Breaking this out another way might be helpful,

19

too.

And, again, Your Honor may want to reference the chart

we attached to Mr. Tobak’s email last night.

21

types of witnesses, witness, whether expert or fact, who

22

submitted written declarations which would be their direct

23

24

25

There are two

Now, with respect to witnesses who submitted

direct testimony, any party certainly has the right to

10

And if the parties abide by this basic

But as an aside, it is very hard to believe that

16

Not a single deposition of any of the debtor’s
And the enormous amount

But, again, the witness’s direct is certainly fair

19

game.

And maybe I’m missing something as to the extent that

20

someone could legitimately spend time crossing within the

21

proper scope.

22

guess we can deal with that during the relevant -- during

23

the hearing via objection.

24
25

And if someone ventures beyond the direct, I

But the seven purely rebuttal witnesses, which
account for 64 hours of estimated evidence time, I believe

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 62
1

are addressing purely opioid merit issues that no one is

2

asking this Court to decide.

3

Now, to be clear -- and let me make this clear --

4

the Debtors believe that holding a mini trial, or perhaps at

5

this point we could call it a maxi trial on the merits as

6

the objecting states seem to intent, would conclusively

7

demonstrate the wisdom of the settlement contemplated in the

8

plan.

9

fighting on the merits for weeks on end would all but prove

The opposing states and the Sackler families fiercely

10

the conclusion that any real merits litigation on these

11

issues would be value-destructive, protracted, uncertain,

12

complex, slow, and weigh heavily in favor of approving the

13

current shareholder settlement.

14

So as a litigator whose myopic task is to win

15

confirmation, this is actually a real gift.

16

will have to determine whether this will be helpful to the

17

Court’s analysis of the plan and whether it is worth

18

massive, massive drain on the resources of the estate that

19

would otherwise go to opioid abatement.

20

But Your Honor

However, to be crystal clear, if there is any

21

doubt as to whether Debtors would be asking the Court to

22

make any finding regarding the strength or weakness of the

23

merits of the states’ claims against the Sacklers, those

24

doubts have now been definitively put to rest now that the

25

Debtors have filed its briefs and submitted its direct case.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 63
1

And I include, Your Honor, our arguments with respect to

2

1129(a)(7), (indiscernible), et cetera.

3

here with the Court and everyone else can look at it.

4

we do not address the merits of the underlying opioid

5

litigation except to say -- to make the very obvious point

6

that success is far from assured and that there are novel

7

legal theories.

8
9

We filed our brief
And

Now, to put the requested time for crossexamination further in context, in the California opioid

10

trial against Endo, Teva, Johnson & Johnson, and Allergan

11

that recently concluded, there was about 28 days of trial

12

testimony.

13

here, if folks get what they want, even on the low end of

14

their estimates, we would get 29 days of testimony in a

15

hearing, Your Honor, where all parties agree is not one in

16

which the merits should be decided.

17

And that included live direct examination.

And

So given the incredible amount of time proposed

18

for what appears to be to the debtors and other parties to

19

be merits witnesses, but cognizant of the incredible cost to

20

the estate that every day of the hearing incurs, the

21

Debtors, the UCC, the AHC, and the two sides of the Sackler

22

families are now working on a stipulation that would provide

23

that any party’s silence during the opioid merits part of

24

the evidentiary presentation, should Your Honor let it go

25

forward, is without prejudice to any future litigation among

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 64
1

the signatory parties or their successors.

2

To put it bluntly, the UCC and most of the states

3

do not want to risk prejudice if they were ever to need to -

4

- if there were ever to be a snapback litigation against the

5

Sackler families under the terms of the shareholder

6

settlement agreement or for any other reason just because

7

they are trying to preserve value of the state by refraining

8

from joining the donnybrook that the opposing states are

9

requesting.

10

So objecting -- just one other point with respect

11

to evidence.

12

I do need to address an issue with respect to the requested

13

cross time that I believe the Court may want to address

14

sooner rather than later.

15

Objecting states’ and merits testimony aside,

The Canadian municipality and First Nations

16

creditors, which we just heard from, which I will call the

17

Canadian Munis for ease of reference, are pursuing

18

fundamentally narrow and legal objections articulated in

19

their 12-page objection to confirmation.

20

strongly disagree with this objection for the reasons

21

addressed in our reply, and I won’t address the merits of

22

the arguments now.

23

The Debtors

But as relevant to our discussion today, the bases

24

for both the objection and the Debtor’s reply are entirely

25

legal in nature.

212-267-6868

The Canadian Munis raise not a single

Page 65
1

factual dispute in their very short objection.

Nonetheless,

2

they alone seek 12 hours, almost a full two days of witness

3

testimony on cross-examination, which would amount to an

4

hour for each page of their objection.

5

nothing in their objection that would warrant any cross-

6

examination, let alone 12 hours of time cross-examining 13

7

different witnesses testifying in support of the plan.

There is simply

8

So I could pause now, Your Honor, because that’s

Can you hear me clearly?

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. GOLD

Yes.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, I

12

would like to just make a few points in general regarding

13

what’s been stated.

14

know, maybe a thousand pages worth of paper that was filed

15

on Thursday when the proponents of the plan for the first

16

time set forth their theory of the case in connection with

17

this confirmation hearing and how they intended to present

18

it.

19

The first is that we received, I don’t

So we have attempted in a shot time to react to

20

what they put forward.

21

working around the clock, nights and weekends, to try to put

22

this together.

23

As Mr. Kaminetzky properly stated,

My second point is that estimating time in the

24

context of a Zoom hearing is a highly, highly uncertain

25

process.

212-267-6868

I would note that this telephonic hearing has been

Veritext Legal Solutions

going on for approximately an hour now.

2

anyone had asked me ahead of time how long it would take to

3

cover (indiscernible), I would have thought it would have

4

been a lot faster.

5

in person, it would have been a lot faster.

6

And I think if

And probably in the old days when it was

So asking us to estimate how long the testimony is

7

going to take is a highly uncertain process.

We will

8

confess to everyone (indiscernible) to take this with the

9

goal of overestimating rather than underestimating so that

10

we would not be in a position afterwards where we were

11

seeking more testimony and someone says but you thought it

12

would take less time.

13

It is possible if we continue to work on our

14

preparation for the witnesses that the amount will come down

15

as --

16

THE COURT:

No, it is more than possible.

And I’m going to cut this short.

It is

17

certain.

I have given

18

more time, reserved more time for this confirmation hearing

19

than I’ve had in any trial since I went on the bench in

MR. GOLDMAN:

Your Honor, Irve Godman from the

Sure.
Thank you.

I’m going to direct my

comments to one specific filing that was made on August 5th.

And that is the declaration of Gregory Joseph which was

20

submitted on behalf of Side B.

270-page document with proposed findings of fact and

22

conclusions of law consisting of 766 paragraphs is in

23

addition to the statement that the Side B family filed in

24

support of confirmation, which is itself 138 pages in

25

length.

That submission, which is a

MR. KAMINETZKY:

THE COURT:

Your Honor, if I may --

We’ll let Mr. Kaminetzky finish his

thought and then...

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Again, the debtors were

extraordinarily careful, like Your Honor said.

We chose the

train that we’re riding, and that’s what we’re doing.

7

the train we’re riding is not the merits.

We have other bases for the confirmation of these plans.

Okay.

So, Mr. Joseph, you were going

to say something I think.

16

MR. JOSEPH:

Thank you, Your Honor.

The

declaration specifically states we are not asking the Court

18

to find facts on the ultimate merits.

would submit on the merits so that the Court has a basis for

And we put in a brief and the attorney

findings.

Right?

MR. JOSEPH:

17

No.

Just to show you that the

That’s where the evidence is.

THE COURT:

Well, except I’m not taking it as

evidence, so I don’t know how it exists.

19

see two ways to go on this.

20

just having the brief, or I could say, look if the states

21

want to also submit hypothetical evidence, they could do

22

that before I end up ruling on confirmation at some point in

23

the week of August 23.

24

that or whether it would make more sense just to exclude it.

25

MR. GOLDMAN:

212-267-6868

I mean, I could

I could see excluding it and

And I don’t know if you want to do

Your Honor, I would say it would

make more sense to exclude it.

I think that we would be

2

disadvantaged in the sense of time.

3

Joseph, we didn’t have time to have an army of professionals

4

put together this --

5

THE COURT:

Because, unlike Mr.

Well, I mean, I posed it as an

6

either/or.

I’m not going to get into whether the states

7

involved here have taken their positions on the plan on

8

something other than a thorough assessment of what they

9

believe these third-party claims are worth, which would

10

strike me as a very odd thing for the state attorney general

11

to have done, but I guess it’s conceivable.

12

So, look, I haven’t reviewed it.

I don’t think

13

there is a motion in limine, although I think my clerks told

14

me one might have either been filed or there are inquiries

15

about it.

16

I can give you my preliminary views today on it.
Again, I haven’t read it because I figured we

refers to the arguments that the Sacklers would make.

19

proposed findings I think do raise the specter of, like, why

20

are they there other than to suggest evidence and that

21

there’s no -- there will be no evidence.

22

at least for now would be to exclude it unless someone wants

23

to chime in.

THE COURT:

That’s really the only

factual testimony on it, so -- just as I’m not taking

factual testimony on the states’ assertions regarding the

Sacklers in light of that.

9

MR. ROBERTSON:

And the reason why, Your Honor,

that the Debtors are -- I don’t know what the right word is

10

-- agnostic as to this is because we think that even without

11

this, there’s plenty of evidence that can be pointed to to

12

show the very uncontroversial point we believe that

13

litigation among the states and the Sacklers would be hard-

14

fought, long, expensive, time-consuming, and everything

15

else.

16

sitting through this hearing would stipulate to that.

I think in fact everyone would, you know, after

of much ado about very little.

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, there are not other

There are just a few other items in evidence that

we may include in that pleading that you just mentioned and

that are probably best reserved for doing --

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. EDMUNDS:

Okay, all right. That’s fine.
But, Your Honor, if I may, the State

24

of Maryland has filed a conclusory affidavit from an

25

investigator asserting claims against the Sacklers.

THE COURT:

MR. EDMUNDS:

He is.
Okay.
Your Honor, if I may, we did file a

declaration of Mr. Brian Sheldon, who was our investigator.

His declaration is in part responsive to what we anticipated

13

because we had some of it in advance from the Sackler

families.

needed based on what Your Honor has said today.

16

are other parts of it that I think go directly to the status

17

of our claims and our litigation that I think are small

18

points that would require Your Honor to resolve the merits.

19

So I think that --

20

And I would think that some of that will not be

THE COURT:

But there

Well, what I suggest on Mr. Sheldon is

21

that you and the Debtor’s counsel and the Sackler’s counsel

22

discuss what is coming out, see if you can agree on that.

23

And in light of those discussions, I think we can see what

24

if anything anyone from the Sackler side would be testifying

25

to.

I have a sense it’s probably fairly minimal.

MR. EDMUNDS:

You would be right, Your Honor.

Thank you.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

And I think that would in all

4

likelihood mean that the 64 hours of testimony on Page 2 of

6

an hour at most is my guess.

But we’ll see after you have

13

MR. HUEBNER:

But you

Your Honor, it’s Marshall Huebner.

14

Just one small process point, as I don’t think we’ll have

15

the transcript in time.

16

I don’t want there to be ambiguity.

I think Mr. Edmunds said -- based on what he said,

17

I want to make sure we all heard it the same way, which is

18

that things like the findings of fact or the conclusions of

19

law that are proposed, and obviously the Debtors do not

20

remotely agree with attached to Mr. Joseph, those were

21

presumptively excluded.

or someone else has to file a motion to exclude them.

25

You’ve essentially synthetically ruled on a synthetic sort

It’s not that Mr. Edmunds

of motion in limine.

Because in fact we all agree, as Mr.

2

Kaminetzky pointed out, that through the looking glass

3

quality of this, everyone on the planet agrees that the

4

Sacklers believe that they would mount a furious defense and

5

they believe or advocated they would be vindicated and that

6

the estates and the AHC and the UCC and MSG and MSCG and the

7

remaining objectors and everyone else agree that we would

8

litigate multibillion-dollar claims against them for a very

9

long time that we believe have great merit, which is why

10

we've been trying for weeks to get people just to agree to a

11

-- we all agree that this would be brutally hard fought --

12

THE COURT:

Okay --

13

MR. HUEBNER: -- incredibly complicated --

14

THE COURT:

I just want to go back to your first

15

point, Mr. Huebner, which is that there really doesn't need

16

to be a motion in limine on this point since it really isn't

17

evidence, but I am giving the Sacklers time to say, you

18

know, Judge, you missed something, there's something in here

19

that should be part of the record.

20

likelihood, I would deny it.

21
22

MR. HUEBNER:

Perfect, Your Honor.

Thank you.

That's all I wanted to clarify for everybody's benefit.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. GOLDMAN:

25

Although, in all

on this subject.

212-267-6868

Okay.
Your Honor, one other quick -- not

It would help us greatly, and I don't know

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 81

whether that the Debtor and other parties could do this, if

2

they could provide us the order in which they intend to call

3

their witnesses, if that's an agreeable --

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. GOLDMAN:

6

THE COURT:

Yeah.
-- (indiscernible).
That makes sense.

I agree with that,

7

and we need to have that anyway, because you need to get the

8

witnesses primed to testify on Zoom.

9

that'll happen.

10

something, too?

11

So that -- I'm sure

Mr. Edmunds, you were going to say

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, I'd just note again,

12

there's a few other pieces.

13

Debtors, Mr. John Dumel -- Dubel, rather, and a few expert

14

reports filed by either side of the Sackler family, and I

15

think we'll just note that (sound drops) in a motion or that

16

-- we don't have to discuss (sound drops) on the record and

17

--

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. EDMUNDS:

20

THE COURT:

Okay.

There's a declaration filed by

All right.

But I -But again, I mean, I think there's a

21

distinction here between the Debtors' claims against the

22

Sacklers and third-party claims against the Sacklers, and it

23

seems to me that most of the 64 hours on Page 2 of this

24

chart go to the latter point, and given what we just went

25

through, the Debtors are not really pushing that issue

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 82
1

directly.

So, I would expect, given, you know, a several

2

hundred-page report and the discovery taken by the Creditors

3

Committee, that the testimony on the Debtors' claims that

4

are being settled under the plan would be a lot shorter than

5

is listed here on this chart.

6

MR. EDMUNDS:

7

THE COURT:

8

MR. GOLDMAN: Your Honor, I don't mean to belabor

9
10

much later than most -THE COURT:

I'm sorry, who is -- I can't see whose

speaking.

13
14

Okay.

the point here, but I -- and I know I've come to the case

11
12

Understood, Your Honor.

MR. GOLDMAN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, it's Irve

Goldman again --

15

THE COURT:

16

MR. GOLDMAN:

Okay, sorry.

I can see you now, yeah.

Yeah, I should've identified myself.

17

And this may be the result of my coming late to the case.

18

The -- obviously Side A and Side B have submitted a

19

substantial amount of evidence on their list, some of which

20

is -- appears to be for the purpose of exonerating the

21

Sacklers on the third-party claims, not the Debtors' claims,

22

and so that also accounted for our response in the sense

23

that we felt we had to meet them.

24
25

The other thing that I found confusing was that,
obviously, there are parties in interest, but they didn't

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 83
1

intervene in the contested matter, which is the confirmation

2

hearing and I'm just wondering how that is going to work,

3

that if the Debtors don't submit evidence on a point but

4

then the Sacklers get to do that, as parties to

5

confirmation, it all becomes part of the record, yet they

6

haven't intervened in the contested matter.

7

THE COURT:

I mean, they are shareholders, right,

8

so they're parties in interest that way, and again, it is

9

not unusual for the non-debtor party to a settlement to

10

remind the Court that as far as they're concerned, they're

11

also giving up value for the settlement.

12

So, any judge will take some level of assertions

13

like that, but as I understood it, at least from our

14

conference last week, the parties in support of the plan,

15

and that would include the Sacklers, were not, unless they

16

were, in essence, forced to by the states, going to be

17

submitting any really material testimony or factual record

18

as to the claims against the Sacklers by third parties.

19

MR. HUEBNER:

And Your Honor, it's Marshall

20

Huebner.

21

avoidance of doubt, I mean, the Debtors have not ever sought

22

to bar basically anybody from participating in these

23

bankruptcy cases.

24

the Bankruptcy Code, the rules, is extremely broad.

25

actually, of course, compelling the Sacklers to waive

212-267-6868

Just to help on that for a minute, I mean, for the

The definition of party in interest under

virtually all claims against the estate.

2

They have actually filed contingent claims.

We,

3

of course, never would've occurred to us in a million years,

4

asking individual states to formally intervene in adversary

5

proceedings.

6

and the like, and I think that's, frankly, how bankruptcy

7

cases always work, because that's how the Bankruptcy Code

8

works in terms of the definition of party in interest.

9

People filed their objections to confirmation

I don't want there to be any implication that any

10

party in this case got any sort of procedural easy pass, you

11

know, to get into a hearing.

12

formally intervene in conformation, and frankly, although it

13

seems bizarre because we think of them as defendants, the

14

Sacklers are actually contingent creditors of the estate and

15

have filed claims preserving those claims, so I don't think

16

there's any world, technical or otherwise in which they

17

could (indiscernible).

18

No one has ever been forced to

I think Mr. Goldman was more asking a question

19

than raising sort of an attack or a concern, but there's no

20

world in which I think one could allege that pretty much

21

anybody who filed a pleading is simply not allowed to be

22

heard at confirmation.

23

THE COURT:

Well, I mean, there are standing

24

issues, but there's not an issue here as to the Sacklers'

25

standing, given that they're shareholders.

impression from the conference we had last week is that if

the states aren't pushing those issues, then the Sacklers

Obviously, if that doesn't happen, then if you

MR. GOLDMAN:

That's helpful, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

Okay.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Your Honor, if I may, and we will

11

work to avoid as many issues as we can.

12

exhibits also go into estate claims like Caremark claims.

13

THE COURT:

A number of these

Well, that -- and that's a different

14

point and you can certainly stipulate that that's the

15

purpose for which they're being used, and not anything else.

16

MR. GOLDMAN:

Thank you.

17

MR. VONNEGUT:

That's what I think some of the

18

(sound drops) might be about is that -- again, I'm just

19

asking people to focus on the difference between estate

20

claims that are being settled and state claims, which is the

21

claims that a state could have in a hypothetical case

22

against the Sacklers.

23

and when you talk about merit or you talk about the

24

evidence, you know, focus on that, because I think there's

25

been lots of confusion in that regard.

212-267-6868

So, they're two different buckets,

12

address briefly, since we're talking about witnesses, still,

13

the order on procedures.

14

So, we could turn to the oral argument

I decided to enter it on the docket so that

15

everyone could see it and sort of take the onus off the

16

Debtor of circulating it.

17

Consla -- well, I guess it was a little after midnight last

I think in advance of the commencement of the

Well, I just want to have it the right

7

MR. VONNEGUT:

8

THE COURT:

9

Because --

Okay.

That's fair, Your Honor.

Because the defined term is, as the

same may be modified or supplemented.

So, I don't know if

10

people have the blackline in front of them, but I was going

11

to add to that blackline in Paragraph 2, which says any

12

party in interest who's filed a timely objection to

13

confirmation of the plan and wishes to participate shall

14

register, and it says how to do that and when.

15

After that boldface language, Tuesday, August 10,

16

2021 at four prevailing eastern time, I've added a footnote

17

which says, "If such a party in interest is the Official

18

Committee of Unsecured Creditors or an Ad Hoc Committee, its

19

members may view but not participate in the proceedings via

20

Zoom if they register their appearance as described above,"

21

and I think that addresses that a couple of the comments

22

were, which was we'd like our clients to be able to see, and

23

that's fine.

24
25

I just don't want lots of different people
speaking on behalf of the objector.

I've, on Page 5, provided that the remote witness

14

I actually want to see the counsel who's in the

I don't -- I expect no one who's appearing at today's

So, I think that those comments

Page 92
1

and my acceptance of the blackline addresses the comments

2

that were sent to me in the letter from around midnight this

3

morning, but if someone has another point they want to raise

4

on this procedures order, you can do it now.

5

MR. ROTHSTEIN:

Your Honor, this is Paul Rothstein

6

for Dr. Masiowski, independent emergency room physician.

7

And the issue that I would raise is that the hospitals have

8

listed four witnesses for direct testimony and those

9

witnesses, from our perspective, are not responding to

10

anything of our objection to the plan.

11

Our objection to confirmation deals with one

12

focused issue on a hospital trust.

13

submitted an expert report.

14

provided by the Debtor in terms of the plan of the hospital

15

trust, Dr. Masiowski did not file that expert report, so the

16

hospital listed rebuttal expert witnesses and -- as a part

17

of the rebuttal expert report, but there is nothing to rebut

18

because Dr. Masiowski's report was served but not filed.

19

Dr. Masiowski had

Then after other materials were

So, the objection that we have is that we don't

20

feel those expert reports should be made part of the record,

21

because, to the extent that they respond to Dr. Masiowski's

22

opinions that were served in regards to the expert report he

23

filed before -- he didn't file, he served -- before

24

additional information was provided.

2

MR. ROTHSTEIN:

We're not looking to introduce the

expert report.

We just want the rebuttal expert reports not

THE COURT:

MR. ROTHSTEIN:

-- evidence.

Well, I haven't reviewed those,

8

either, so I don't know whether they are strictly in

9

rebuttal to that report where the record is now clear that

10

Mr. Masiowski is not looking to rely on it or introduce it

11

or have it be part of the record, so I think that's -- I

12

understand the logic of what you're saying.

know whether those expert reports that you're referring to

really are just in rebuttal to something that now they don't

need to be in rebuttal to.

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, if I may, just for 20

5

seconds to give, at least, what hopefully is some comfort,

6

for the avoidance of doubt, there are voluminous pleadings

7

filed throughout the case by counsel for the personal injury

8

claimants on the adult side, separate pleadings filed by the

9

NAS Children on the juvenile and younger side, including

10

pleadings filed in support of confirmation.

11

Obviously, I'm leaving aside the fact that, you

12

know, 38 of the 38 states who represent their citizens

13

clearly speak for all of their citizens and many other

14

representative groups, so please, rest assured that entirely

15

separate from the views of the Debtors as fiduciaries for

16

all stakeholder, the Official Committee of Unsecured

17

Creditors as fiduciary for all stakeholders, with all

18

creditors, we have unofficial groups, that, as the judge

19

pointed out, represent thousands, tens of thousands, or

20

hundreds of thousands of creditors who have been actively

21

involved in negotiating and participating in settlements and

22

virtually all of them support confirmation.

23

So, I just don't want there to be a mis-impression

24

that no one is speaking, even at confirmation, if you look

25

back at the docket, which is provided free of charge, even

212-267-6868

over the last week, you will see pleadings filed by the

Municipalities Group, the Official Creditors Committee, the

3

Adult PI Victims, the NAS Children, the UCC, and the Debtors

4

on all of these issues.

5

but it's such an important issue about sort of where people

6

line up and obviously (indiscernible) vote, so please do

rest assured that there are many, many, many people who care

very deeply about the individual victims here.

is what, you see, Your Honor, takes into account certain of

the -- certain of the comments that we received.

18

we think that the only thing that makes sense here, given

19

the overlapping nature of the objections -- for example, 11

20

objections deal with third-party releases.

21

only rational way to do this is to break it up by topics,

22

allocate 50 percent for one side, 50 percent of the time for

24

own side and present the argument in that way.

that the issues should be split up in that way, other than,

to take your guidance.

me the same arguments, for example.

appreciate the States, that at least three counsel would

appear for the States.

themselves to something that their colleague missed or that

their colleague wanted to leave to them.

I would expect that they'll be one

Can you tell who that

And then I just want to be clear, because when you

10

have, for example, No. 12, Canadian Municipality creditors,

11

No. 10, Native American Tribe objection, these are

12

objections other than the third-party release points that

13

they have raised, which I think is clear.

14

that clear.

15

I want to make

The last point I'd raise is, I think what you have

16

down here is more than two days for oral argument, which

17

seems too long to me.

18

frankly, I think it should be less than that.

At most, it should be two days.

MR. GOLDMAN:

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

MR. GOLDMAN:

Your Honor -we're happy --

response to Your Honor's comment.

I just don't want people repeating

MR. GOLDMAN:
Your Honor.

Okay.

Just wanted to make sure,

Thank you.

THE COURT:

Right.

And again, I think that

6

counsel for the other parties who have raised third-party

claim release or injunction issues should coordinate among

8

themselves and the States to make sure that, you know, we're

9

not repeating testimony.

I mean, we're not repeating

argument, excuse me.

11

These -- and again, it seems to me that, frankly,

12

the issues generally have been briefed.

13

precedent on them, what is unique or unusual here, is the

14

argument -- the federalism argument made by the States, but

15

the other arguments are largely -- well, put it this way,

16

other than tying the testimony into the argument, your

17

briefs pretty much cover them.

18

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

There's a lot of

Your Honor, Paul Schwartzberg

19

for the U.S. Trustee's Office.

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Yes.
I just -- Your Honor, the six

22

hours allocated to the third-party releases split 50 percent

23

to the Debtor side, 50 percent to the objector side, that's

24

three hours for, I believe, 17, if I'm counting them up,

25

different parties.

212-267-6868

Now, obviously, nobody's going to try to

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 104
1

repeat what's been said, but it seems that third-party

2

releases are an extremely important issue in this case and

3

three hours for all of the parties to set forth their

4

closing arguments seems to be not sufficient.

5

THE COURT:

I -- six hours on this issue is just

6

ridiculous to me.

It's just not -- it doesn't correspond to

7

the state of the law.

8

three hours, and the other parties shouldn't.

9

could see maybe an hour on the States' unique arguments.

I don't think the Debtors will take
I mean, I
It

10

just -- there's caselaw on this.

11

this isn't new stuff.

12

into the record, but these are issues that people have been

13

ruling on since the early -- well, actually, since the '80s.

14

This isn't -- you know,

Yes, we do have to tie the arguments

So, and again, they're well briefed.

And as you

15

know, I read the briefs.

So, I'm not bothered -- I mean, if

16

I'm bothered at all by this, I'm bothered by the fact that I

17

think it's too much time for oral argument.

18

example, a, you know, 95-count complaint against 35

19

different defendants, all of whom are different, and, you

20

know, you have to hear -- you have to hear from each of

21

them.

22

for example, where I have had an all-day argument.

This isn't, for

It's just not like that -- on a motion to dismiss,

THE COURT:

4

MR. HUEBNER:

I think that's not a vain hope.
Your Honor, although -- this is

5

Marshall Huebner.

To be clear, I mean, this colloquy

6

exactly proves the point.

7

assuming Mr. Schwartzberg, invariably, is correct, right,

8

making largely similar arguments on what we believe is

9

largely a pure issue of law and the problem is, you know, if

There are 17 objectors -- I'm

10

each of those people is allowed, you know, time, first of

11

all, the Debtors have to respond alone to 17, which is why

12

the -- you know, the view that the objectors somehow deserve

13

more time because there are more of them piling on,

14

obviously, is decidedly unfair.

15

We could have easily taken the position that we

16

deserve more time because we, alone, have to respond to a

17

huge multiplicity of things.

18

went right down the middle and said 50/50 on every issue.

19

But we didn't do that.

We

I'd also note that if we were in the Supreme

20

Court, there'd be one lead counsel and there would be

21

probably 10 to 12 to 18 to 20 minutes a side.

22

Circuit wouldn't be much different and the District Court

23

wouldn't be much different.

24

and the notion that six hours of oral argument does not

25

suffice, is pretty hard to accept.

THE COURT:

MR. HUEBNER:

You cut out, Mr. Huebner.
-- sort of sovereign status as being

5

different in this context.

6

the rest just doesn't make -- and we're very concerned about

7

each person taking an extra five or an extra ten --

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. HUEBNER:

10

You know, okay, but, you know,

All right.
-- which collectively is -- could be

two more days.

11

THE COURT:

Right.

No, I understand, and I guess

12

where I'm leaning on this is that with the slight adjustment

13

to the order that I mentioned, it would seem to me that the

14

people on this list who would be preparing to argue, say, on

15

day two or day three at the beginning of that day, should

16

also be prepared to argue at the end of the day preceding

17

because we might get to them.

18

19

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

In fact, we probably will get

Your Honor, just to be clear,

20

when you say order of those arguing, that's within the

21

various issues that we've laid out, right?

22

THE COURT:

Yeah, one, two, three, four through 15

23

or 14.

24

if you looked at the time here, you would assume that he's

25

going to be in the morning of the second day of oral

2

so Mr. Rothstein needs to be ready for that.

3

He may well be in the afternoon of the first day,

What we haven't discussed is, I think, the -- as

4

always happens with a confirmation hearing -- there needs to

5

be time in your schedule, both for the evidentiary

6

presentations and the oral argument, for the Debtor to

7

reflect agreements or modifications to the plan on the

8

record.

9

to the section of the plan that deals with third-party

And in particular, that would be useful with regard

10

releases and injunctions, if you're going to narrow that in

11

any way.

12

If you can -- you know, the sooner you decide to

13

do that, if you're going to do that, you should get that out

14

on the record so that everyone can address the more narrowed

15

version as opposed to the wider version.

16
17

So, I don't know if anyone has anything more to
say about oral argument?

There's a

11

think there's a resolution yet.

12

we may need five minutes during that time for that issue, if

13

it's not resolved.

14

I don't

I hope it's resolved, but

Well, you're down here, but

what you're saying is, other than Ms. Steege, you may be

MR. JONES:

Yes, Your Honor.

confirmation.

6

I'm not quite sure why, ultimately, their issues

MS. STEEGE:

Your Honor, to speak to that, one of

7

the reasons why we're speaking to third-party releases isn't

8

to sit there and recite the Metromedia factors to you, but

9

to point out something that treats us differently than

10

everyone else.

The Sacklers are providing a release to

11

every other creditor that's releasing them, except for the

12

members of our group, and that's a unique issue.

13

want to take a lot of time pointing that out, but there are

some arguments related to that and with the other --

4

suffered through oral rulings before by me.

5

MR. PREIS:

Okay.

Thank you for that

6

clarification.

Third issue, Mr. Kaminetzky about two hours

7

ago mentioned the fact that we are working on a stipulation

8

with the Sacklers to ensure that there's no prejudice to any

9

party that is not taking part in the evidentiary portion of

10

the hearing, namely the UCC, the parties that are on board

11

with the case, the future (indiscernible), et cetera.

12

I just wanted to reiterate, I know he said it

13

rather quickly, but it is an important part for us in

14

particular, as it is for (sound drops).

15

THE COURT:

And this is a stipulation what would

16

say, if things fall apart, and people are pursuing their

17

claims, the failure to -- or, not the failure -- the choice

18

not to actively participate isn't a waiver in that -- of the

19

right to pursue claims in the future, right?

20

MR. PREIS:

Well, it's two things.

First of all,

21

when you say fall apart, it could fall apart (sound drops)

22

the order, the confirmation order (sound drops), or second,

23

in the future, if the Sacklers default on the settlement

24

agreement, there's a potential for (indiscernible), but

25

that's one.

212-267-6868

And two, it's not just prejudice that we didn't

make argument.

2

cross examine any witnesses.

are.

They're not very voluminous.
So just send hard copies to chambers

Your Honor, this is Philip Anker for

Navigators, one of the insurers.

If I might be heard very

14

briefly, we are hopeful, frankly, that we will be able, if

15

not entirely, almost entirely not participate in the

16

confirmation order -- confirmation hearing, I should say, at

17

all.

18

the form of so-called insurance neutrality they had in the

19

plan that went out for solicitation, the fifth amended plan,

20

would largely, if not entirely, be acceptable to us and I

21

can promise you we will and we are seeking to negotiate a

22

way -- frankly, I don't think these are issues, insurance

23

coverage, that are relevant to the confirmation hearing and

24

we share Your Honor's desire to narrow rather than broaden.

We are seeking -- we've indicated to the Debtors that

25

The only reason I speak up -- and I've said this

516-608-2400

Page 115
1

offline in a series of emails, but I just want to say it for

2

the record.

3

think narrow the hearing if we could get, even if it's

4

working draft, a draft of the proposed confirmation order so

5

we know what findings, precisely, if any, are being sought

6

with respect to our issues that we think would be

7

inappropriate.

8
9

It would be enormously helpful to us and I

It will inform us in examining witnesses.

You

know, there are declaration that have stray statements in

10

them that could be read to testify on insurance coverage

11

issues.

12

and I'd, rather than waste time with a cross and waste time

13

with an argument, it would be helpful -- I will say the Ad

14

Hoc Committee did put in, in their reply brief, identified

15

some findings they intend to request.

16

I don't think that's the intent, but they're there

That was helpful, because I think we can negotiate

17

on some and we can then narrow where we disagree, so I

18

simply say, it would be helpful to us to get this across the

19

finish line and get out of Your Honor's hair and everyone

20

else's hair, if we could see the confirmation order on that

21

-- on those issues at least, and be able then to speak with

22

the Debtors and with the claimant groups to try to narrow or

23

eliminate altogether our issues.

24
25

As I say, our goal is not to lengthen the hearing;
our goal is not to interject coverage issues into this

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

13

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

All right.

Anything else?

I think we're done.

No?

Just to put

14

on your -- well, I guess two things.

15

Your Honor's radar, there seem to be two evidentiary motions

16

that two parties have filed, neither of which really involve

17

the Debtor.

18

think you've -- we had a little bit of that.

19

Docket 3482.

20

One, just to put on

The first is an objection by Dr. Masiowski.

THE COURT:

I

That's at

There's going to be a meet and confer

21

on that, though, I think, right?

22

it's not resolved, I'll deal with it when the exhibit comes

23

up as opposed to ruling in advance on it.

24
25

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

And I think that one, if

The second is a motion to exclude

under Daubert the expert testimony of William Hrycay.

think I'm spell -- I'm saying that right.

2

Side A of the Sackler family.

That's Docket No. 3490 and

3

the notice of docket is 3491.

I think that was just filed.

4

I just wanted to put that on Your Honor's radar.

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

7

Whose expert is he?
It's the States -- the objecting

States' expert.

8
9

It was brought by

THE COURT:

All right.

Well, this may be part of

the discussion that we had at length at the beginning of the

10

hearing.

11

discussed at this hearing, I'm not sure how much that expert

12

is going to be offered for at this point.

13

the party to discuss that, and again, I think I'd rather you

14

have that discussion first before I address it, and I can

15

address it when -- if I need to, if the States are still

16

looking to have his testimony admitted.

17

It may not be that -- in light of what we

MR. GOLD:

So, I would like

Your Honor, this is Matthew Gold.

That

18

makes -- we agree, that makes perfect sense.

19

be a little helpful because as of yet, we're expecting the

20

next few days, I've heard, that we'll be getting the order

21

in which witnesses may be heard.

22

no event would this witness be called on the first day of

23

the hearing and once we have that order, we can make sure

24

that we can try to resolve and narrow any issues, see if

25

this has to be briefed and heard with an understanding of

212-267-6868

We -- it would

My expectation is that in

Page 118

what day this is -- we're actually pointing toward.

2

THE COURT:

All right.

That's fine, although I

3

would hope that your group of three lawyers and the

4

Sacklers' lawyers would engage even before the order of

5

witnesses is circulated, so that while this is fresh on your

6

-- this conference is fresh in your mind, you can see what,

7

if anything, remains as far as certain aspects of the

8

evidence that both sides had put down as wanting to put in,

9

but I think have acknowledged today they probably don't

10

intend to put in.

11

So, I would like you all to start on that;

12

although, maybe you need to get some sleep, but I'd like you

13

all to start on that today, frankly.

14
15

MR. GOLD:

We will, Your Honor.

This literally

arose over the weekend.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

17

MR. TROOP:

And Your Honor, just -- Your Honor,

18

Andrew Troop for the Non-Consenting States.

19

it's not our witness, there are allegations in the motion

20

which are incorrect as they relate to the Non-Consenting

21

States Group and I'm happy to talk with that side counsel

22

about that, but right now, they noticed up an objection

23

deadline for Thursday at the start of the hearing.

24
25

While there --

I'm assuming that based on your ruling, that
objection deadline was going to be (sound drops) that

objection deadline in connection with (sound drops)

2

testimony we've offered.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, I haven't read this

4

motion.

5

So I -- I'm not sure why it's referring to your group

6

anyway, Mr. Troop, which is, at this point, kind of a -- you

7

know, a Dalmatian or a zebra group.

title.

11

In any event, yeah, I think

12

that this will be narrowed down considerably and, in all

13

likelihood, I'll probably rule on it, if I have to rule on

14

it at all, when Mr. H-R-Y-C-A-Y is offered up as a witness.

15

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

16

MR. TROOP:

17

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

18

MR. TROOP:

19

Your Honor, a final word --

I'm sorry, Ben -Sorry.

If there are unresolved issues, we'll

get (sound drops) advance of that.

20

THE COURT:

Okay.

That's fine.

21

MR. ANKER:

This is Mr. Anker.

May I just make

22

one comment before -- I realize everyone's trying to -- I

23

appreciate we're testing your patience, Your Honor.

24

wanted to give you a heads up.

25

comments earlier, get the witness declarations late

212-267-6868

I just

We did (sound drops) my

Thursday.

Consistent with our view that many of them have

2

nothing to do with confirmation, I think we are likely, as

3

early, possibly, as today, to move to exclude some of them

4

and to exclude some of the exhibits.

5

because we just had a discussion about it and I didn't want

6

to be accused, Your Honor, of sandbagging and not informing

7

the Court and I pledge to Your Honor and the Debtors, we are

8

happy to sit down and will sit down and try to narrow the

9

issues consensually.

I wanted to say that

But I just said that because I didn't

10

want to have the record end and anyone think that we had, as

11

I said, sandbagged and not been forthcoming.

12

Your Honor.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

Thank you,

Okay.
Your Honor, just a final word

15

just to make sure we're clear.

16

us, I think by my count, 11 days for this confirmation

17

hearing.

18

also mentioned that you think two days are sufficient for

19

the oral argument on the --

20
21

I don't want people to walk away -- and Your Honor

THE COURT:

Oral argument and rulings.

Oral

argument and rulings.

22

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

THE COURT:

24

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

Your Honor generously gave

And ruling.

Yeah.
But are you -- I don't want

people to walk away thinking that you're expecting, then,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 121
1

eight full days of testimony or that you feel like you need

2

eight full days of testimony.

3

THE COURT:

I have those days available.

Again, I

4

don't think I will need them all.

5

hard to reduce it, because otherwise if people are seeking

6

to have testimony that's irrelevant, I'll exclude it.

7

just think it's better for the attorneys to know sort of the

8

outside range and then use their professional judgment based

9

on the issues that are actually before the Court and who has

10

the burden of proof to come up with a schedule that actually

11

makes sense.

12

You should work really

I

Otherwise, we'll be spending time that isn't

13

really necessary, I think, if people do that, and me telling

14

people no, you got to stop, this testimony is irrelevant,

15

it's a waste of time.

16

a waste of time, too, because you guys should've figured

17

that out beforehand.

18
19

And of course, just my saying that is

MR. KAMINTEZKY:

That's all I have, Your Honor.

Thank you.

20

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

All right.

My

21

clerk reminds me that you, in addition to the omni day, you

22

had actually scheduled a separate motion, the KEIP motion,

23

for the 19th, so you need to take that into account, too, on

24

how -- what you want to do with that as far as the timing

25

here.

I appreciate all the hard work you've been

putting into this, and that's the collective you, you know,

important things you need to do over the next few days.
