Chandler Bing: You wanna share it?
Monica Geller: Okay!!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Monica Geller: It's not mayonnaise!!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
Chandler Bing: What's this?
Joey Tribbiani: Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Chandler Bing: Aww, thanks man.
Monica Geller: Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Chandler Bing: Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Joey Tribbiani: Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Chandler Bing: Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Joey Tribbiani: Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
