Phoebe Buffay: Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
The Lurker: I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!

Phoebe Buffay: Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
The Lurker: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
The Lurker: Also Monday.
Phoebe Buffay: What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
