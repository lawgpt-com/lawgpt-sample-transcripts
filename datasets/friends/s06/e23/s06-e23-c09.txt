Phoebe Buffay: Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Chandler Bing: Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
Chandler Bing: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Chandler Bing: They put you in jail?
Phoebe Buffay: The little jail between the doors!
Chandler Bing: Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Phoebe Buffay: I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Chandler Bing: Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe it was the guy.
Chandler Bing: It was the ring!
