Janine Lecroix: What's the matter? Are you upset?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Janine Lecroix: Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Joey Tribbiani: Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Janine Lecroix: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
