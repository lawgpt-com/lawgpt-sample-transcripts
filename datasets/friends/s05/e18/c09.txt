Monica Geller: How did work go?
Rachel Green: Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Monica Geller: You stink!
Rachel Green: Thanks!
Monica Geller: No, I'm-I'm serious!
Rachel Green: Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Chandler Bing: Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Rachel Green: I did not!
Chandler Bing: Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Rachel Green: All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Chandler Bing: I wish I had smoked for my career...
Monica Geller: That's so gross!
Rachel Green: No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler Bing: Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Monica Geller: Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Chandler Bing: I think you smell great!
