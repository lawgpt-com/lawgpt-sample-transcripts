Chandler Bing: Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
Wendy: ...Missy?
Chandler Bing: I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Wendy: You are to me...
Chandler Bing: No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
Wendy: So? I'm married.
Chandler Bing: I'm *happily* married.
Wendy: Oh. - What's *that* like?
Chandler Bing: Right. So, I'm sorry...
Wendy: Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Chandler Bing: Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Wendy: Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
