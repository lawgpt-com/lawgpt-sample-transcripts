Dr. Ledbetter: Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Ross Geller: Yeah, of course, Donald.
Dr. Ledbetter: We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
Ross Geller: What?!
Dr. Ledbetter: Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Dr. Ledbetter: We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Ross Geller: Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Dr. Ledbetter: A sandwich?
Ross Geller: Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Dr. Ledbetter: Oh, you know what?
Ross Geller: What?
Dr. Ledbetter: I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Ross Geller: You ate my sandwich?
Dr. Ledbetter: It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Ross Geller: Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Dr. Ledbetter: No.
Ross Geller: Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Dr. Ledbetter: There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
Ross Geller: That said it was my sandwich?!
Dr. Ledbetter: Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Ross Geller: What?
Dr. Ledbetter: Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
