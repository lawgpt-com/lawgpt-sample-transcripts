Charity Guy: May I help you?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Charity Guy: Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one.
Charity Guy: Well, this is very generous!
Phoebe Buffay: And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Mike Hannigan: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Phoebe Buffay: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Charity Guy: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Mike Hannigan: Not necessary.
Phoebe Buffay: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Mike Hannigan: And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
Charity Guy: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
Phoebe Buffay: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Mike Hannigan: It does. It feels really good!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
Charity Guy: Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
Phoebe Buffay: Mhm... it's moist.
