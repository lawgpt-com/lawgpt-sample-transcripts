Phoebe Buffay: God! God! This is not going well.
Mike Hannigan: No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
Mike Hannigan: Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Phoebe Buffay: So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Theodore: Oh... Well...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
Theodore: Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah I bet! Look out!
Theodore: OH! OWWWWW!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, are you okay?
Theodore: I recently had surgery.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm so sorry!
Theodore: No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
Phoebe Buffay: I really, really am sorry.
Theodore: How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
Mike Hannigan: Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
Mike Hannigan: But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
Mike Hannigan: Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

Bitsy Hannigan: Well, not at all...
Phoebe Buffay: Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Bitsy Hannigan: Thank you, I think so too.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
Bitsy Hannigan: Is he really?
Phoebe Buffay: Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
Bitsy Hannigan: E-e-excuse me?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
Bitsy Hannigan: That's... my boy.
Mike Hannigan: Awesome!
