Rachel Green: Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Ross Geller: Not two years in a row.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
Monica Geller: You have to!

Chandler Bing: You're an actor!
Monica Geller: So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Ross Geller: Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Joey Tribbiani: That hot girl from their wedding?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
Phoebe Buffay: Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Ross Geller: That's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. Please don't take her from me.
