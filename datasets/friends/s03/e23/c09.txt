Phoebe Buffay: Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Fireman: Oh sure. Vince?!
Vince: Yo!!
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Vince: So, what's up?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Vince: Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry.
Vince: No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, I didn't...
Vince: I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
