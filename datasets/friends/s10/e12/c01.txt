Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hey Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
Joey Tribbiani: So he can't come?
Phoebe Buffay: No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Joey Tribbiani: Seriously?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Joey Tribbiani: I am pretty wisdomous.
Phoebe Buffay: So... what do you say?
Joey Tribbiani: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Joey Tribbiani: Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
