Rachel Green: Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Any sign of your brother?
Phoebe Buffay: No, but he's always late.
Rachel Green: I thought you only met him once?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Rachel Green: Well relax, he'll be here.
Phoebe Buffay: No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Rachel Green: Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
