Joey Tribbiani: Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Monica Geller: Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Monica Geller: Why?
Joey Tribbiani: Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Monica Geller: What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Joey Tribbiani: No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Monica Geller: No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Joey Tribbiani: I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
