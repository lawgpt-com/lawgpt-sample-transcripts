Female Clerk: Can I help you?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Female Clerk: He's not here right now.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Female Clerk: Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
