Joey's Hand Twin: Are you gonna play?
Joey Tribbiani: No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...

Phoebe Buffay: Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Joey's Hand Twin: 14.
Joey Tribbiani: Hit me!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Joey's Hand Twin: Stop it!
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Joey's Hand Twin: Please stop it!
Joey Tribbiani: Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Joey's Hand Twin: If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
