Joey Tribbiani: All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Rachel Green: Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Joey Tribbiani: Just flip!
Rachel Green: Ha, tails!
Joey Tribbiani: Damnit!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Rachel Green: Oh, that sounds good!
Monica Geller: Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Rachel Green: It's all done!
Monica Geller: Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Rachel Green: I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Monica Geller: Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
Rachel Green: Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Chandler Bing: Where's your passport?
Rachel Green: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Chandler Bing: Well, it's not.
Rachel Green: What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Monica Geller: Here, let me help you.
Rachel Green: Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Chandler Bing: At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
