Phoebe Buffay: New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Ross Geller: OK, here goes.
Joey Tribbiani: Are you going to do it?
Ross Geller: I'm going to do it.
Joey Tribbiani: Do you want any help?
Ross Geller: You come out there, you're a dead man.
Joey Tribbiani: Good luck, man.
Ross Geller: Thanks. OK.
Joey Tribbiani: OK.
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, where are you going?
Monica Geller: Outside.
Joey Tribbiani: You can't go out there.
Monica Geller: Why not?
Joey Tribbiani: Because of... the reason.
Monica Geller: And that would be?
Joey Tribbiani: I, um, can't tell you.
Monica Geller: Joey, what's going on?
Joey Tribbiani: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Monica Geller: About what?
Joey Tribbiani: He's planning your birthday party.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! I love him!
Joey Tribbiani: You'd better act surprised.
Phoebe Buffay: About what?
Monica Geller: My surprise party!
Phoebe Buffay: What surprise party?
Monica Geller: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, he didn't tell me.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Phoebe Buffay: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Monica Geller: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe Buffay: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
