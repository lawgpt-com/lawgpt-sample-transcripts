Rachel Green: Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Joanna: I thought it went very well.
Rachel Green: No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Joanna: Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
Rachel Green: There's nobody here!
Joanna: Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Sophie: She's not making me uncomfortable.
Joanna: Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Rachel Green: Do you want me to quit?
Joanna: What?! What would make you think that?
Rachel Green: Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Joanna: Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
Rachel Green: What?
Joanna: That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
Rachel Green: My drinking?
Joanna: Oh, I must've said that after you left.
Rachel Green: Said what? Exactly.
Joanna: That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Rachel Green: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Joanna: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Rachel Green: Say more things like that.
Joanna: You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Rachel Green: I'd need an expense account.
Joanna: Done!
Rachel Green: And an assistant.
Joanna: Sophie, get in here!
