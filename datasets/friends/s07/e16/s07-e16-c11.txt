Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Chandler Bing: Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Chandler Bing: Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Joey Tribbiani: No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Chandler Bing: How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
Chandler Bing: That's what you should say.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Joey Tribbiani: Really? I can do it?
Chandler Bing: I'd love it if you would do it.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: But those are the words! Those exact words!
Joey Tribbiani: Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
