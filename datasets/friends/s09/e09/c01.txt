Jo Lynn: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
Chandler Bing: Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
Chandler Bing: Chandler Bing.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
Chandler Bing: What's up Joe?
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Chandler Bing: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!
Chandler Bing: Courtside? Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Chandler Bing: That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Monica Geller: Hello?
Chandler Bing: Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Monica Geller: Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Chandler Bing: But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
Monica Geller: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
Chandler Bing: I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Monica Geller: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
