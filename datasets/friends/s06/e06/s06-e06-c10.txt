Chandler Bing: You win.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, what did you have?
Chandler Bing: It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, wow, 700.
Chandler Bing: Not 700 exactly?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Double it!
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Joey Tribbiani: Really?
Chandler Bing: Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
