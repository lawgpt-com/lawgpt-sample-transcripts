Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God, you're back!
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!

Phoebe Buffay: Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Monica Geller: Okay.
Chandler Bing: What did you guys just do?!
Phoebe Buffay: What happened?
Chandler Bing: Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Joey Tribbiani: What?! Noooo...
Chandler Bing: I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Joey Tribbiani: We didn't ruin it!
Chandler Bing: Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Joey Tribbiani: Glove salesman!
Phoebe Buffay: Good one! Yeah.
Chandler Bing: This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Phoebe Buffay: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Chandler Bing: That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Chandler Bing: I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Monica Geller: I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Joey Tribbiani: That guy's still doing that?!
Rachel Green: Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
Phoebe Buffay: No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
