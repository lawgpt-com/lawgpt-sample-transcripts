Monica Geller: So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Carol Willick: Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Susan Bunch: Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.

Carol Willick: We love you. Buy.
Ross Geller: Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
Monica Geller: Ross.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Monica Geller: Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Joey Tribbiani: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Ross Geller: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Monica Geller: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Joey Tribbiani: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Ross Geller: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Chandler Bing: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Monica Geller: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Ross Geller: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Chandler Bing: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Monica Geller: You're meeting Richard?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Monica Geller: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Chandler Bing: You hear that? We're the guys.
Joey Tribbiani: We're the guys.
Monica Geller: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Ross Geller: Thank you.
