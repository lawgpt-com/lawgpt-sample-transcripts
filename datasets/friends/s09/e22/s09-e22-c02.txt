Ross Geller: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Chandler Bing: I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.

Chandler Bing: But you come first!
Rachel Green: I'm there!
Charlie Wheeler: We'll see you, guys!
Joey Tribbiani: Bye.
Rachel Green: Bye, see ya.
Chandler Bing: Ok.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Chandler Bing: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Ross Geller: So-so what did the doctor say?
Chandler Bing: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Joey Tribbiani: So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Chandler Bing: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Chandler Bing: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Joey Tribbiani: Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Chandler Bing: ah-ha!
Ross Geller: How do you feel about all this?
Chandler Bing: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Ross Geller: What?
Ross Geller: What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
