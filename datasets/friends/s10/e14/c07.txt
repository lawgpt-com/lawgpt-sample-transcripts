Phoebe Buffay: Nope.
Mike Hannigan: You really did that?
Phoebe Buffay: Yep.

Mike Hannigan: Crap Bag.
Phoebe Buffay: Mike Crap Bag?
Mike Hannigan: No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
Phoebe Buffay: You're not serious, right?
Mike Hannigan: Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
