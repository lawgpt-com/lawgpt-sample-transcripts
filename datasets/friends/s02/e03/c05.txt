Ross Geller: How can you not believe in evolution?
Phoebe Buffay: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Ross Geller: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? You can actually see it?
Ross Geller: You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Phoebe Buffay: See, I didn't know that.
Ross Geller: Well, there you go.
Phoebe Buffay: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
