Rachel Green: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Monica Geller: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.

Phoebe Buffay: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Rachel Green: Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
