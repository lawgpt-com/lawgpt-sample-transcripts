Rachel Green: I wrote you a letter.
Ross Geller: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Rachel Green: It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Ross Geller: Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Rachel Green: Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Ross Geller: Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
