Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: So how was, how was your date?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Joey Tribbiani: No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, yeah.
Rachel Green: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Joey Tribbiani: Where are you gettin' this?
Rachel Green: Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh. Oh.
Rachel Green: Joey...
Joey Tribbiani: No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Phoebe Buffay: Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Rachel Green: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Joey Tribbiani: No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Rachel Green: Well that too. Joey?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Do you want some pancakes?
Joey Tribbiani: Finally!
