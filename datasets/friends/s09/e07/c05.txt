Catherine: Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
Joey Tribbiani: Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Chandler Bing: So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Catherine: Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
Chandler Bing: mmm That's enough about you!
Joey Tribbiani: Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Catherine: All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...
Chandler Bing: No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Catherine: Oh... Okay, sorry!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Chandler Bing: We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?
Joey Tribbiani: You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
Chandler Bing: Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
Chandler Bing: Get there faster!
