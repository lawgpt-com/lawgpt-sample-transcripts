Michael: Um, cheers.
Rachel Green: Oh, right, clink.
Michael: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Rachel Green: Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Michael: Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Rachel Green: I mean he just started going out with her.
Michael: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
