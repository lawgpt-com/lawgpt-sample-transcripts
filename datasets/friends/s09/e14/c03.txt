Rachel Green: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Chandler Bing: See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Rachel Green: I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Monica Geller: Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Rachel Green: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Monica Geller: Oh my god.
Chandler Bing: Wow.
Rachel Green: Why? What's the big deal?
Monica Geller: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Rachel Green: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Chandler Bing: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Monica Geller: You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Rachel Green: So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
Monica Geller: Oh, it's perfect.
Rachel Green: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
Chandler Bing: Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
