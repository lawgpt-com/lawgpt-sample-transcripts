Ross Geller: A thumb?!
unknown: nan
#ALL#: Eww!
Phoebe Buffay: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Chandler Bing: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Phoebe Buffay: Does, um, anyone wanna see?
#ALL#: Nooo!
unknown: nan
#ALL#: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Rachel Green: It's worse than the thumb!
Chandler Bing: Hey, this is so unfair!
Monica Geller: Oh, why is it unfair?
Chandler Bing: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Rachel Green: Well, I-I could live without it.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, "you do, do you"?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Rachel Green: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Rachel Green: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
