Monica Geller: Oh my God!
Ross Geller: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Monica Geller: I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Ross Geller: Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.

Ross Geller: Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Monica Geller: It's hard for some people!
Chandler Bing: Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
