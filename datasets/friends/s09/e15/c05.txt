Phoebe Buffay: Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
Ross Geller: Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I hear divorce bells.
Lowell (mugger): Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
Ross Geller: What?
Lowell (mugger): I have a gun.
Ross Geller: O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
Lowell (mugger): Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Ross Geller: What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe Buffay: Lowell, is that you?
Lowell (mugger): Phoebe? Oh my god!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my god!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
Lowell (mugger): Ross, nice to meet you.
Ross Geller: Yeah, a real pleasure.
Phoebe Buffay: Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
Lowell (mugger): Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
Phoebe Buffay: Good for you!
Lowell (mugger): So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
Phoebe Buffay: Ouh...
Ross Geller: Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Phoebe Buffay: Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
