Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Monica Geller: You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Phoebe Buffay: You're not making the pies yourself?
Monica Geller: No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Rachel Green: Did you at least win the contest?
Monica Geller: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Rachel Green: Can't wait!
Monica Geller: This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey Rach.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: What's Emma doing today?
Rachel Green: Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Rachel Green: Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Rachel Green: Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh... okay.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Rachel Green: And a thousand dollars.
Rachel Green: ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Rachel Green: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I was thinking...
Rachel Green: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
