Janice Litman Goralnik: What a small world!
Chandler Bing: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Realtor: You two know each other?
Janice Litman Goralnik: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.
Chandler Bing: Don't, don't!
Monica Geller: No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
Chandler Bing: Why!?
Monica Geller: I don't know why.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
Chandler Bing: This can not be happening!
Monica Geller: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Chandler Bing: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Monica Geller: Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Chandler Bing: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Monica Geller: Okay, you come up with an idea.
Chandler Bing: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Monica Geller: But we love our house.
Chandler Bing: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
Monica Geller: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Chandler Bing: Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
