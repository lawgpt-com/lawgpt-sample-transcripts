Rachel Green: Y'know what?
Mark Robinson: No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Rachel Green: I can't do this.
Mark Robinson: Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Rachel Green: Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Mark Robinson: Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Rachel Green: Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Mark Robinson: That's okay.
Rachel Green: You sure?
Mark Robinson: Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
