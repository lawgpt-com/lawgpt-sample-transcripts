Rachel Green: Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Ross Geller: Yes, exactly!
Rachel Green: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Ross Geller: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Rachel Green: Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Ross Geller: I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Rachel Green: What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Ross Geller: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Rachel Green: Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
Ross Geller: I'm asking you to do me a favor.
Rachel Green: You are asking me to be your wife!
Ross Geller: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
