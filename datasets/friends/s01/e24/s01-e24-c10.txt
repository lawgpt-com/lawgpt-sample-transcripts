Carl (Rachel's date): I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!

Ross Geller: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Rachel Green: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross Geller: Fine, just stop thinking about me.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Can't do it, can you?
Rachel Green: So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross Geller: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rachel Green: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Carl (Rachel's date): I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Ross Geller: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel Green: Ross, it's too hard.
Ross Geller: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Rachel Green: Ross, you're like my best friend.
Ross Geller: I know.
Rachel Green: If we broke up, and I lost you...
Ross Geller: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel Green: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross Geller: No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Rachel Green: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross Geller: Well, start looking.

Rachel Green: Wow.
Carl (Rachel's date): Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel Green: Right! You're right!
Carl (Rachel's date): Heh... y'know?
Rachel Green: You know what?
Carl (Rachel's date): What?
Rachel Green: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.

Carl (Rachel's date): But...
