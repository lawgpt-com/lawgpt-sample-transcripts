Rachel Green: Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Monica Geller: Still crying?
Rachel Green: Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Monica Geller: Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Rachel Green: What's the other one?
Monica Geller: I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Rachel Green: Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Monica Geller: Oh, we have some...
Rachel Green: No you don't!
