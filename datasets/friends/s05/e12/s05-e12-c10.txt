Rachel Green: Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Monica Geller: My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Rachel Green: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Monica Geller: What?!
Rachel Green: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Monica Geller: Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Rachel Green: Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Monica Geller: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Rachel Green: What?!
Monica Geller: Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Rachel Green: All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Monica Geller: Me and Chandler?!
