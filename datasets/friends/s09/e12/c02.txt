Phoebe Buffay: Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
Mike Hannigan: Lima.
Phoebe Buffay: No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
Mike Hannigan: You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". Oh god! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Mike Hannigan: OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
Mike Hannigan: What, is he your pet rat?
Phoebe Buffay: Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
Mike Hannigan: You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
Phoebe Buffay: What are those?
Mike Hannigan: I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
Phoebe Buffay: OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Mike Hannigan: Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay: So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
