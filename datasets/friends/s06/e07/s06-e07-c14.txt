Monica Geller: Is it okay for me to come in now?
Chandler Bing: Uh-huh
Monica Geller: Why is everything different?
Ross Geller: Bye!
Chandler Bing: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Monica Geller: Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Chandler Bing: Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Monica Geller: It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Chandler Bing: Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Monica Geller: Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Chandler Bing: Really?
Monica Geller: Of course!
Chandler Bing: Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Monica Geller: All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
