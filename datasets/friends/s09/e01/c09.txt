Chandler Bing: You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
Joey Tribbiani: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Chandler Bing: Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
Joey Tribbiani: I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Chandler Bing: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Joey Tribbiani: Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
Chandler Bing: Okay, look, just do it gently.
Joey Tribbiani: You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.
