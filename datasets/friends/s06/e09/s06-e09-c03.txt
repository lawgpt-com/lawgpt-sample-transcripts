Phoebe Buffay: Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Rachel Green: Really?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
unknown: nan
Rachel Green: I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
unknown: nan
Monica Geller: Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Jack Geller: I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Rachel Green: Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Ross Geller: Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Rachel Green: It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: W-What was the one right before bananas?
Rachel Green: The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Joey Tribbiani: Y-sure!
Rachel Green: And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay.
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
unknown: nan
Joey Tribbiani: I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler!
Ross Geller: Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Ross Geller: No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Joey Tribbiani: Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Ross Geller: Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Joey Tribbiani: Vomiting stories are funny...
