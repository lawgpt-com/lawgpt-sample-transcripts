Phoebe Buffay: Hey, what are you working on?
Joey Tribbiani: It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
Phoebe Buffay: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
Joey Tribbiani: No, I sat in the paint.
Ross Geller: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
Ross Geller: No, and I'm not going to.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Why not?
Ross Geller: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Phoebe Buffay: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
Ross Geller: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Phoebe Buffay: Uh, Joe?
Joey Tribbiani: Damn it!
Ross Geller: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Phoebe Buffay: No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
Mike Hannigan: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! What do you have there?
Mike Hannigan: Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
Ross Geller: Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Phoebe Buffay: Honey, that's gorgeous!
Joey Tribbiani: You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Rachel Green: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Joey Tribbiani: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
Rachel Green: Oh my God!
Ross Geller: Oh my God!
Rachel Green: Hi! Oh my gosh!
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Rachel Green: Oh.
Ross Geller: Oh my God!
Rachel Green: What... What...
Ross Geller: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Monica Geller: Yes, it's twins!
Ross Geller: Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Monica Geller: This is a boy, and that's a girl.
Chandler Bing: Her name is Erica.
Rachel Green: Aw..
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Chandler Bing: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Monica Geller: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Ross Geller: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Rachel Green: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Mike Hannigan: I want one.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
Mike Hannigan: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Phoebe Buffay: One? How about a whole bunch?
Mike Hannigan: Really?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
Rachel Green: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Monica Geller: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Rachel Green: Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
Monica Geller: I love you.
Chandler Bing: I love you.
Monica Geller: Call us when you get there.
Rachel Green: I will. Ross, come here.
Rachel Green: I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Ross Geller: Neither will I.
Rachel Green: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
Phoebe Buffay: So, you just let her go?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Phoebe Buffay: But now she'll never know how he feels!
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Ross Geller: Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Ross Geller: I don't! I wanna be with her.
Joey Tribbiani: Really?
Ross Geller: Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you are!
Phoebe Buffay: Woo!
Phoebe Buffay: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
Ross Geller: My coat...
Joey Tribbiani: This is so cool!
Chandler Bing: I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Joey Tribbiani: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Ross Geller: I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Phoebe Buffay: You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
Ross Geller: Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Phoebe Buffay: Hurry!
Joey Tribbiani: Good luck, good luck!
