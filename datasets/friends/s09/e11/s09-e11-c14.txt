Gavin Mitchell: Wow, you're here already.
Rachel Green: Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Gavin Mitchell: How do you fix the chair?
Rachel Green: Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
Mr. Zelner: Good, because it's in ten minutes.
Rachel Green: What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
Mr. Zelner: Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.
Rachel Green: Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
Gavin Mitchell: You can do the presentation.
Rachel Green: No, I can't, I have a baby.
Gavin Mitchell: I'll watch her.
Rachel Green: Why would you do that?
Gavin Mitchell: Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.
Rachel Green: That's really nice.
Gavin Mitchell: I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Rachel Green: Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
Gavin Mitchell: I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.
