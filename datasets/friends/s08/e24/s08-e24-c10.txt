Cliff: Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know what? This one is.
Cliff: Oh my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before!
Phoebe Buffay: Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Cliff: I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
Phoebe Buffay: Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Joey Tribbiani: Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
Cliff: That-that's him! You know him?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
Cliff: I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
Joey Tribbiani: Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Cliff: And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
Phoebe Buffay: You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
Cliff: I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Phoebe Buffay: Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
Joey Tribbiani: Right!
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
Cliff: It doesn't happen to me either.
Joey Tribbiani: Me neither.
