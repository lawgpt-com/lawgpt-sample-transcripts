Host: This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Rachel Green: Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
Phoebe Buffay: We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Rachel Green: Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Rachel Green: Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Phoebe Buffay: But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Rachel Green: Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Rachel Green: Really?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Rachel Green: You heard them say that?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Rachel Green: All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Phoebe Buffay: Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Rachel Green: No, what?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Rachel Green: No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Phoebe Buffay: Why not!
Rachel Green: Because I already did!
