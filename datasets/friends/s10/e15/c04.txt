Joey Tribbiani: Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey. Everything ok?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm just mad at my agent.
Phoebe Buffay: Estelle? Why?
Joey Tribbiani: There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm guessing she does.
Joey Tribbiani: Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
Joey Tribbiani: Ok. Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
Joey Tribbiani: I love that saying! .
Joey Tribbiani: Hello?
Phoebe Buffay: Joey, it's Estelle.
Joey Tribbiani: I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
Phoebe Buffay: It's a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, actually I am!
Phoebe Buffay: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
Joey Tribbiani: That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Phoebe Buffay: Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you saying?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm saying that... . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. .
Phoebe Buffay: Man, tough week for Estelle!
