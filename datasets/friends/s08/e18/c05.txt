Parker: My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
Phoebe Buffay: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Parker: I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh thank God.
Parker: It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
Parker: That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.
Phoebe Buffay: Let's try something else, let's play a game.
Parker: I love games!
Phoebe Buffay: Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Parker: Or...Jenga.
Phoebe Buffay: But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
unknown: nan
Parker: I lose, now Jenga.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Parker: Is something wrong?
Phoebe Buffay: Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Parker: Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
Phoebe Buffay: You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
Parker: I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
Phoebe Buffay: No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
Parker: So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
Phoebe Buffay: Much less happy!
Parker: Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
Phoebe Buffay: So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!

Parker: Isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh huh.
