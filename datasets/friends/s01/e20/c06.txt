Chandler Bing: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Chandler Bing: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ross Geller: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Chandler Bing: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.

Phoebe Buffay: How many beeps?
Chandler Bing: She answered.
Monica Geller: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Chandler Bing: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
