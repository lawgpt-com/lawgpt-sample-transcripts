THE COURT:

Okay, good morning.

This is Judge

3

Drain.

4

the hearing on motions for a stay pending appeal of the

5

Court's confirmation order, as well as the Court's, what

6

I'll refer to as implementation procedures order filed by

7

the United States Trustee, the States of Washington,

8

Connecticut, and California, certain Canadian creditors, Ms.

9

Ellen Isaacs, and Mr. Ronald Bass.

10

We're here in In re Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al on

So I believe I've reviewed all of the relevant

11

pleadings on these motions, including the various objections

12

and the replies and the declarations submitted in support of

13

the objections.

14

I'll also note my order dated November 3, 2021

15

establishing procedures for this remote hearing, which is

16

being held entirely remotely.

17

the hearing as a movant or objectant by Zoom for Government

18

and, otherwise, by telephone.

19

For those participating in

So I'm happy to proceed with the motions, unless

20

there's been any development on them, which I had encouraged

21

the last time the parties were before me as a way

22

potentially to resolve these motions.

MR. HIGGINS:

Your Honor, this is Ben Higgins for

24

the U.S. Trustee.

2

We had two housekeeping issues to flag for Your

3

Honor, but we don't have a resolution of the stay motions,

4

to answer Your Honor's question directly.

5

THE COURT:

housekeeping, the request to exceed page limits on various

7

pleadings?

MR. HIGGINS:
Honor.

10
11

That is the first item, yes, Your

THE COURT:
motion too.

Okay.

And the Debtors made such a

I'll grant both of those motions.

12

MR. HIGGINS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

13

The second housekeeping issue, as we previewed for

14

Your Honor at the October 14 status conference, we did file

15

a amended memorandum of law at Docket No. 3972 with specific

16

citations to documents.

17

And we also, as we discussed at the October 14

18

hearing, we filed two designations at Docket Nos. 3918 and

19

4043, identifying specific documents that are either in the

20

record and that we're asking the Court to take judicial

21

notice of.

22

did, I know Your Honor raised a couple of questions at the

23

last status conference.

24
25

We haven't received any objections, but if we

So to the extent I can clarify anything or address
any questions, I'm happy to do that, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

I think you reduced the list to

2

address my concerns, which were that you were seeking that I

3

take judicial notice of matters that were not appropriate to

4

take judicial notice of, namely press accounts and the like,

5

correct?

6

MR. HIGGINS:

Well, just to be clear, Your Honor,

7

the second designation was actually a supplement to the

8

first designation, so we were still asking you to take

9

judicial notice of what we listed in the first designation.

10

And I can clarify what we're seeking it for, Your Honor, and

11

you can determine if it's appropriate or not.

12

we're happy to live with your decision on that.
Okay.

You know,

13

THE COURT:

Why don't you do that.

14

MR. HIGGINS:

15

So I believe the items that you raised issues

Sure, Your Honor.

16

with, we listed some pending legislation, as well as the

17

records of some of congressional hearings concerning the

18

validity of third-party releases.

19

And we're asking you to take judicial notice

20

merely for the fact that the validity of third-party

21

releases is an issue of public interest and they're publicly

22

available documents, and we're simply asking you to take

23

judicial notice of the fact these materials exist.

24

the limit of it and we're willing to live with Your Honor's

25

decision either way, but that's the request, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

7

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Your Honor

Okay.
The rest of -- what I saw most of

8

what's been submitted are various pleadings from this case,

9

we don't have a problem with that.

10

THE COURT:

Right, and I have no problem with

11

those pleadings or with pleadings filed in other courts, as

12

long as they're not being -- sought to be admitted for the

13

truth of the pleadings as opposed to just the fact that

14

these are pleadings that have been filed.

Maryland.

11

threshold issue from our reply first.

12

will probably want to hear what everyone has to say anyway.

13

I don't -- it may be helpful if I address a
I think the Court

But logically, the one issue which is the effect

14

of the District Court's decision on the Trustee's and

15

Canadian entities' motion for a stay in that Court limits, I

16

think, what is before the Court today.

17

Because there's a clear ruling, an unappealed

18

ruling, a ruling, in fact, that the appellees acquiesced

19

from the District Court that holds that there's a likelihood

20

of success on the merits and that the issue raised by the

21

Trustee, which is the issue of equitable mootness, raises

22

when the Debtors or appellees are actually doing something

23

that the balance of hardships would tip decidedly in the

24

Trustee's and the Canadian entities' favor.

25

And so, there's a finding, and there's a finding

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 49
1

that in the end denies those parties' motion for a stay

2

because the District Court found that there's nothing going

3

on right now.

4

states making motions and to the U.S. Trustee coming forward

5

with evidence that something is happening now.

6

without prejudice to that showing or to those showings, and

7

she does not decide the states' motions, which had not been

8

formally brought before her.

9

But you found that without prejudice to the

So it's

But to the extent she rules on that equitable

10

mootness issue and addresses the likelihood of success on

11

the merits is raised in the other parties' motions before

12

that Court, those findings are her decision.

13

sure that, you know, there's any -- they could have

14

appealed, but I think that they become law of the case in

15

light of the fact that they haven't.

16

And I'm not

And they've, in fact, filed a stipulation in the

17

District Court essentially doing -- purporting to comply

18

with the conditions that the District Court placed in its

19

denial of the stay, so that issue, I think, is the threshold

20

matter.

21

And I understand the Court is likely to hear

22

everybody, but just as a logical matter, it seemed important

23

to raise that first.

24

THE COURT:

3

touched on in a reply, so you've caught me a little bit

4

unprepared on this, Mr. Edmunds, but I want to get out the

5

order.

7

This was an issue that really was, if anything,

MR. EDMUNDS:

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. EDMUNDS:

10

THE COURT:

I know.
But if you need the opinion -I'm not faulting you for not raising

11

it when you did then, but I want to make sure I have Judge

12

McMahon's order in front of me, which I am leafing through.

13

Well, here it is.

14

I found it.

MR. EDMUNDS:

I think it might be attached to our

15

reply as an exhibit.

16

the relevant language --

17

THE COURT:

18

MR. EDMUNDS:

19

THE COURT:

20

If it's helpful, Your Honor, I think

No.

I'm reading -- let me read it --

Okay.
-- as to the points that you're

specifically raising.

21

MR. EDMUNDS:

22

THE COURT:

Sure.
Well, again, I've just reread it.

And

23

on the two points that you've raised, Mr. Edmunds, that you

24

say would be law of the case, the first one is whether the

25

merits prong has been satisfied.

212-267-6868

And there, Judge McMahon

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 51
1

says, "In this case, Debtors conceded at oral argument on

2

October 12 the existence of sufficiently serious questions

3

going to the merits to make them a fair ground for

4

litigation."

5

The other point that you raised, however, as far

6

as the possibility of equitable mootness is in the context

7

of the balance of hardship and not as to a finding as to

8

whether equitable mootness has risen above the level of

9

speculation.

10

So I think it's a little more -- maybe I didn't

11

hear you clearly enough, but I think it's a little more

12

complicated than you stated.

13

irreparable harm and its relation to equitable mootness and

14

the issue of the balance of the harms and its relation to

15

equitable mootness are not exactly the same issue.

16

secondly, I think they're both quite context specific as far

17

as the record before the Court.

18

I think that issue of

And

The case law seems to be uniform that the risk of

19

equitable mootness -- and of course, that's an evaluation

20

that the Court needs to make and that clearly is not law of

21

the case as far as Judge McMahon's order -- standing alone

22

or vel non is not irreparable harm or arguably harm but

23

needs to be taken into account with other factors.

24
25

So it seems to me that the record before me is
important still on that point.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 52
1

If the objectors are arguing that the risk of

2

equitable mootness just isn't to be taken into account, I

3

completely agree with you; in fact, I wouldn't need Judge

4

McMahon's ruling because it is to be taken into account.

5

But I don't think it's dispositive on this point, given the

6

different record before her and before me.

7

So I think the thing we should probably focus on,

8

although I'm happy to hear you more on this, is the effect

9

of the Debtors' concession.

I mean, both -- not both -- all

10

parties have spent a considerable amount of time,

11

notwithstanding that concession, arguing the merits of the

12

appeal, both in the motions themselves, which again I

13

repeat, were made before the hearing before Judge McMahon,

14

but also in the replies.

15

So I was going to suggest to the parties that they

16

spend the vast bulk of their time not addressing the merits,

17

but rather, addressing the other three factors and the bond

18

issues.

19

merits point in the first case as to whether their

20

concession should be viewed as a concession for this hearing

21

as well.

22

But why don't I hear from the objectors on the

MR. EDMUNDS:

Sure, Your Honor.

Let me just --

23

you've read it the same way, I think, we have, which is that

24

there is a fact issue on the balance of hardships and that

25

the question of whether, you know, the possibility of

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 53
1

equitable mootness vel non is a, you know, irreparable harm

2

question, is decided by her and that equitable mootness

3

could pose irreparable harm, but the fact issues are still

4

left open as to what's happening now.

5

So I think -- I'm not saying -- I wasn't saying

6

anything different and I think that we've read it the same

7

way.

8
9

THE COURT:
Mr. Edmunds.

Well, maybe with one qualification,

Based on my review of the case law, and I

10

don't think Judge McMahon is saying anything different, the

11

weight to be given to the risk of equitable mootness

12

constitute two ways: first, the way that we clearly agree

13

on, which is the Court needs to evaluate how likely it is

14

that something would become equitably moot; the second is

15

whether -- and this second point is very closely tied to the

16

first point -- I think the more likely it is that something

17

becomes equitably moot, the less important it is to

18

establish something in addition to the risk of mootness.

19

And nevertheless, I do think that is a second

20

inquiry because I believe all the courts, including the

21

Adelphia court and St. Johnsbury Trucking court have said

22

standing alone, the risk of equitable mootness isn't enough.

23

But what needs to be shown, in addition to that, can be any

24

one of the other factors, it seems to me.

25

seriousness of the issues on appeal; it can be the issue of

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

It can be the

516-608-2400

Page 54
1

whether a reversal as appear at victory.

2

You know, there are all sorts of things that can

3

affect that extra something that I think all the courts

4

recognize you need to have in addition to just the risk of

5

equitable mootness.

6

seriousness of the issues on appeal, and also, the courts'

7

assessment of the likelihood of success on appeal.

8

something really does seem to be maybe not a frivolous

9

appeal, but a real long shot, then the risk of mootness

10

And again, that can be merely the

If

really doesn't seem to be something that courts care about.

11

So I think I may go back again to the question,

12

which is the -- my recommendation was that we not spend a

13

lot of time on the merits of the appeal, showing of the

14

substantial possibility of success, and really only as it

15

pertains to the other three issues.

16

So Mr. Kamenetzky's on the screen.

I know there

17

are other objectors too, but I'll look to you on that point.

18

You're on mute.

19
20

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Your Honor, good morning.

Benjamin Kaminetzky of Davis Polk for the Debtors.

21

I could just address the effect of Judge McMahon's

22

order, the kind of contention by Maryland that there's some

23

sort of law of the case or issue preclusion because I think

24

that's just completely inherently wrong.

25

go further, but I just think it's important that we address

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

If you want, I can

516-608-2400

Page 55
1

that upfront because Mr. Edmunds suggested something that

2

just, it's just completely and utterly false.

3

get two minutes on that.

4

If I could

And then, you know, I assume you'd want them to go

5

first on the other factors.

And I agree that spending a lot

6

of time on probability of success on the merits, which is

7

devolved into another oral argument that you've heard for

8

hours now, are so -- on the point, just Mr. Edmunds point.

9

Again, it's just a blatant mischaracterization of Judge

10

McMahon's decision and what happened.

11

you some context.

12

So let me just give

The U.S. Trustee filed an emergency stay motion

13

before the District Court on the evening of Friday, October

14

8th.

15

breathless suggestion that something could be happening over

16

the weekend, Judge McMahon heard that motion the very next

17

business day without a single brief from the Debtors or any

18

other party.

After entering a TRO based on the U.S. Trustee's

19

We had no opportunity -- the Debtors and the plan

20

proponents had no opportunity to put in any evidence at the

21

hearing.

22

U.S. Trustee filed in connection with its Friday night

23

emergency motion, had no evidence from anyone else, no

24

briefs from anyone else.

25

confirmation hearing transcripts or anything.

212-267-6868

All the District Court had was the brief that the

They didn't even have the

Page 56
1

What Judge McMahon focused on at this emergency

2

hearing that was held, you know, that Tuesday, which was the

3

next business day, was -- and the Debtors and the plan

4

proponents didn't present any argument whatsoever on the

5

likelihood of success of the appeal.

6

on whether the movant's evidence might suffer harm in the

7

interim period between that day and today when Your Honor

8

will be hearing the stay motion.

9

The focus was solely

All of that notwithstanding, the District Court

10

denied the U.S. Trustee's stay motion the next business day,

11

as she concluded that the movants had not identified any

12

concrete harm that will arise between now and November 9

13

when Judge Drain is scheduled to consider the various stay

14

motions.

That's on Page 12 of her decision.

15

Now, the notion --

16

THE COURT:

Okay, so could I just interrupt you?

17

So you're basically saying that your concession that Judge

18

McMahon's decision refers to was really just a concession

19

for purposes of that hearing because you were focusing on

20

the --

21

MR. KAMINETZKY:

It wasn't even that.

Judge

22

McMahon misheard.

23

Huebner said is even if we give them all three other

24

factors, they nevertheless lose because there's no harm.

25

There was a hypothetical which he misheard.

212-267-6868

She didn't have the transcript.

Veritext Legal Solutions

What Mr.

We corrected

516-608-2400

Page 57
1

her in a subsequent filing and said, no, we've reviewed the

2

transcript.

3

there are substantial issues, there's no harm because

4

nothing would happen between now and November 9, so it was

5

kind of in that context.

6

It was one of these even if they're right that

And Judge McMahon, as you said, there was a

7

concession, but there actually wasn't; it wasn't in the

8

context of an even if they could prove all three other

9

factors, they certainly can prove imminent harm.

And again,

we corrected her on the record.

identifying and pointing that out in the transcript.

12

We sent a letter

But more important, the law is very clear what

13

collateral estoppel means and it doesn't mean.

14

Second Circuit law here is well developed:

15

estoppel only applies if the identical issue was decided in

16

the prior proceeding.

17

none of the issues before the Court today was actually

18

decided by Judge McMahon.

19

And, I mean,

Collateral

And none of the issues, Your Honor,

Again, what she was focused on, based on the U.S.

20

Trustee's emergency motion, is do I need to do something now

21

before the November 9 hearing before Judge Drain, and she

22

said no, but that was the entire focus of the hearing.

23

as Your Honor knows, nothing could possibly have happened

24

because the sentencing needs to happen and the effective

25

date and all that.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And

516-608-2400

Page 58
1

So there was absolutely no ruling whatsoever on

2

the balance of harm with respect to an indefinite stay,

3

which the movants are seeking, or even any sort of stay

4

beyond November 9.

5

There's also -- you know, we talked about that

6

there wasn't a concession.

There's also collateral estoppel

7

only applies where there's a full and fair opportunity to

8

litigate the relevant issues in the first proceeding, and

9

I'm quoting from Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company, 56

10

F.3d 359 at 368.

11

filed on Friday night when we're imminent on Tuesday

12

morning, was obviously not a full and fair opportunity to

13

litigate.

14

don't get collateral estoppel because the Judge only heard

15

one side; there was no ability to submit evidence.

16

Obviously, when on an emergency motion

So even if it was the same issue, they still

17

collateral estoppel only applies where there was a final

18

judgment on the merits.

19

decision on a TRO on a stay motion, not a final judgment on

20

the merits, and it cannot give rise to collateral estoppel.

21

And to say this again, this was a

And, of course, neither the two cases that

22

Maryland cites in its brief has anything remotely to do with

23

the preclusive effect of a decision on emergency stay

24

motion.

25

to a final judgment on the merits.

212-267-6868

They both involve prior actions that were litigated
In the PCH case that

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 59
1

they cite, there was a final and binding decision on the

2

merits and affirmed on appeal that the relationship between

3

parties was a joint venture and the Court found that that

4

was law of the case.

5

6

that's when the Court held that there was a collateral

7

estoppel.

8
9

And in the other case they cite, the

So, I mean, I think it speaks volumes that the
actual movants before the District Court didn't even dare

10

make this argument that there's some collateral estoppel

11

effect of Judge McMahon's decision.

12

people are -- I mean, it's clear why now, because this is

13

such a, quite frankly, bizarre argument that somehow on a

14

TRO emergency motion that there's some sort of binding

15

decision that's law of the case that prevents Your Honor

16

from making his own determination I think is just completely

17

and utterly wrong.

18
19

And I see why now

And I'll stop now because I don't want to, again,
step on anyone's toes.

20

THE COURT:

Okay, all right.

Well, I think you've

21

addressed the point I really wanted you to address, which is

22

what sort of concession was referred to in that order, and I

23

think I have the context here in any event.

24

it was a concession, other than for purposes of that

25

argument and not for purposes of this argument.

I don't believe

516-608-2400

Page 60
1

Although that being said, it appears to me that

2

the parties should primarily focus on the other three

3

factors for obtaining a stay pending appeal and assume that

4

I've reviewed their arguments with respect to the

5

substantial possibility of success on the merits and still

6

remain fully aware of how I addressed those issues in my

decision.

8

MR. EDMUNDS:

9

THE COURT:

Your Honor, may I respond briefly?
Well, I don't think there's -- I think

10

I've already given my view on this, and I don't think

11

there's any other thing to say on it.

12

there's anything more to be said on it really, unless you

13

say that somehow that they did concede for all time.

14

MR. EDMUNDS:

I mean, I'm not sure

I don't think it matters whether

15

it's a concession.

16

on the issue, and it made a determination as to likelihood

17

of success on the merits and it said that it was not going

18

to allow the appeal to come equitably mooted.

19

THE COURT:

I think the District Court made a ruling

Clearly, the order doesn't say that.

20

It says the Debtors concede, and the only issue is whether

21

they conceded for purposes of that argument or for all time,

22

and I'm satisfied that they did not concede for all time

23

because I can't imagine they would in that context.

24

no ruling on the likelihood of the merits, no discussion on

25

the likelihood of the merits here.

THE COURT:

9

But I

Okay.
I don't need to say more I guess.
Okay.
All right.
All right.

Thank you, Your Honor.
Okay, so I do have a

suggestion for structuring this argument beyond what I've

10

already said, which is I want the parties to focus on what

11

sort of stay they are seeking in terms of duration and

12

activity, and also address it in the light of Bankruptcy

13

Rule 8025.

14

The parties -- the U.S. Trustee has thrown out

15

different alternatives, which includes a stay that would be

16

ordered by me for a relatively brief period after the

17

District Court's ruling.

18

It's not clear to me whether the three states have

19

limited their request for a stay in any way or whether

20

they're seeking a stay by me that would go through

21

ultimately a final order, which could conceivably be either

22

denial of certiorari or a ruling by the Supreme Court.

23

And I think this is important in the context again

24

of Bankruptcy Rule 8025, which is titled, Stay of a District

25

Court -- or BAP, but the focus here's on the District Court

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 62
1

of course -- Judgment, which states in (a):

2

District Court orders otherwise, its judgment is stayed for

3

14 days after entry."

4

of Rule 8025, which says that if the District Court enters a

5

judgment affirming an order of judgment or a decree of the

6

Bankruptcy Court, a stay of the District Court's judgment

7

automatically stays the Bankruptcy Court's order, judgment,

8

or decree for the duration of the appellate stay.

9

"Unless the

16

then it says, "Stay continued if before a stay expires.

18

stay continues until final disposition by the Court of

Appeals."

20

"When a party's motion and notice to all other

The

"This rule does not

limit the power of the Court of Appeals or any of its judges

22

to do the following, including: a stay; stay proceedings

23

while an appeal is pending; suspending, modifying, restore,

24

vacating, or granting a stay while an appeal is pending; or

25

issue any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 63
1

the effectiveness of any judgment to be entered."

2

So clearly, appeals from Bankruptcy Court orders

3

should generally and ordinarily be, where there's a motion

4

seeking a stay, that motion should be brought first in the

5

Bankruptcy Court, and courts regularly deny such motions if

6

they are not brought first in the Bankruptcy Court unless

7

there's a legitimate reason to do so.

8

a motion for a stay of a judgment, order, or decree of the

9

Bankruptcy Court pending appeal.

10

But 8007 pertains to

So I have a serious concern that any request for a

11

stay pending appeal beyond the District Court's ruling is

12

not really properly before me or it shouldn't be decided by

13

me -- maybe that's a better way to phrase it -- given Rule

14

8025.

15

So let me first ask, is anyone looking for relief

16

beyond a stay up to the time that the District Court rules?

17
18

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, this is Beth Levine for

the United States Trustee.

19

We have asked for relief beyond that.

We think,

20

as we argued in our papers, that this Court has the

21

authority, both under Rule 8007 and its inherent authority

22

to control its docket, to stay its own orders, to enter a

23

stay pending a conclusion of the appellate process, so we

24

have asked for that full relief of a stay pending the

25

conclusion of the appellate process or, in the alternative,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 64
1

pending the District Court's decision.

2

that additional relief.

3
4

THE COURT:

Right.

So we have asked for

Although I don't think you

addressed Rule 8025 or the case law interpreting it.

5

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, I think we addressed the

6

language if 8025, which is different.

7

does not have the limiting language that refers to the

8

duration of the stay that Rule 8025 does.

9

the District Court's stay of another court, the Bankruptcy

10

Court's order, which I think is a somewhat different thing

11

than a Bankruptcy Court staying its own order, and that

12

you've got that discretion to stay your own order pending

13

the appeals.

14

You know, Rule 8007

8025 refers to

Certainly, you've got the discretion to determine

15

how long that stay should be, but we are asking for that

16

stay for the full duration of the appellate process, with

17

the alternative request for a stay at least until the

18

District Court has made its decision.

19

THE COURT:

20

MS. LEVINE:

Okay.
Your Honor, would you like me to

21

proceed with our motion now or to hear from others on that

22

at this point?

23

THE COURT:

Well, let me just make sure, as far as

24

the three states are concerned, are you looking for a stay

25

through the entire course of any appellate process?

to him, in the alternative under either 8007 or 8025, he

20

decided the motion himself under 8025 after his ruling and

21

denied the motion on the merits for a stay.

22

Although rather

But I think it's important, and I believe it's

23

consistent actually with Judge McMahon's approach, for the

24

parties to focus on the two alternative forms of stay that

25

the parties are seeking here: their preferred one, which is

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 67
1

through the entire appellate process, and alternatively,

2

through the District Court's ruling.

3

Because the determination of the issues and, in

4

particular, the three factors other than on the merits, to

5

my mind, could be quite different depending on whether it's

6

a stay through the District Court's ruling or a stay through

7

either denial of cert or a ruling by the Supreme Court,

8

which obviously would take a significantly longer amount of

9

time.

10

And on the merits issue, obviously a trial judge

11

that is faced with a request for a stay pending appeal is

12

always in the awkward position of evaluating the merits of

13

the trial judge's own opinion -- that isn't a problem for

14

the District Judge -- and makes that review, I think, much

15

more, in some ways at least, if on a psychological basis,

16

more meaningful.

17

So I really do want the parties to focus on those

18

two different durations for a stay, and so, you should

19

address your arguments accordingly.

20

So I don't know if you decided who was going to go

21

first, whether it's Ms. Levine or counsel for one of the

22

three states, but one of you should go ahead.

I wanted to say one thing, which is that Judge

5

McMahon in Footnote 4 on Page 10 of her decision, you know,

6

said that she considered it obvious that there are serious

7

questions going to the merits and making the fair ground for

8

litigation.

9

We think that is true.

You know, certainly, we don't expect you to agree

10

that you've erred.

We know you disagree with our legal

11

position.

12

that they merit appellate review and that the denial of that

13

appellate review, if there were a dismissal based on

14

equitable mootness, would be irreparable harm.

But we think there are very serious questions and

15

And it's not just the denial of appellate review

16

vel non itself; it's because you have claims here that are

17

being eliminated without consent that would be permanently

18

irreparably gone without that appellate review.

19

THE COURT:

Well, can we focus on that for a

20

second?

First, you went -- and I'm responsible for this

21

since I told the parties not to focus substantially on the

22

merits -- you went very quickly from that to the issue of

23

irreparable harm.

24

And I just -- I want to be upfront with everyone.

25

It seems to me that there are, in fact, issues going to the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 69
1

merits that are somewhere between, you know, a mere

2

possibility of success and a probability of success.

3

think many of the issues raised by the U.S. Trustee and the

4

three states do not fall into that category; that, in fact,

5

they are unlikely to prevail on appeal.

6

524(e) point, the due process point, and their assessment of

7

the merits of the settlement.

8
9

I

Those go to the

But I agree that the issue of a release of thirdparty claims is, in every instance, a serious issue that

10

requires a Court to sift through complicated legal and

11

factual considerations.

12

what types of claims that would belong to a third party,

13

i.e., not the Debtors' estate, that can be appropriately,

14

legally enjoined requires serious parsing of the case law

15

and is certainly something that even the Second Circuit case

16

law recognizes as an issue where the lower court can get it

17

wrong, as was the case in Metromedia and Carter and other

18

decisions which recognize the underlying principle that the

19

Court has power to enjoin third-party claims.

20

the line as to what claims can be enjoined and what can't is

21

something that courts can well disagree on.

22

And the limits, in particular, on

But drawing

So on that point -- unlike on the due process, the

23

jurisdictional points, the 524 point, frankly, even the

24

state sovereignty point, all of which I think are unlikely

25

to prevail on appeal -- this issue as to how released claims

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 70
1

are to be cabined is, I believe, one that does satisfy the

2

requirement to show a strong showing of likelihood to

3

succeed on the merits, such that there's a fair ground for

4

litigation.

5

Although again, as recognized, for example, by

6

Judge Chapman in In re Sabine Oil & Gas Corp., 551 B.R. 132,

7

143 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2016), the focus on the degree of

8

likelihood of success is tempered by the balance of the

9

harms or the Court's assessment of the balance of the harms.

10

So I suppose the objectors can try to persuade me

11

to the contrary, but I think that I want to turn then to the

12

irreparable harm point that you were starting to make.

13

the argument you made is that the people and governmental

14

entities that objected to the release or injunction would

15

lose their rights if a stay was not granted.

16

And

And again, this goes to my direction to you all to

17

focus on the two different times for the stay.

18

I'm having a hard time seeing how that would be the case if

19

the stay were granted or not granted either way through the

20

date of the District Court's ruling with the additional 14

21

days that are added on under Rule 8025.

22

I confess

And further, I'm having a hard time, although

23

maybe not as hard, with the argument that equitable mootness

24

really would occur here if a stay were not granted through

25

the date of the entire appellate process.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

I guess that

516-608-2400

Page 71
1

depends, in some measure, upon whether the plan is

2

substantially consummated.

3

But as far as the release is concerned, the

4

majority of the payments by the released parties, as you

5

yourself point out, occurs substantially down the road, and

6

under the plan, they have a credit only for what they've

7

paid in the interim.

8
9

So it seems to me under either scenario too broad
to say that these people who the U.S. Trustee says that he's

10

speaking on behalf of would lose their rights.

11

only lose it if there's equitable mootness, right?

12

MS. LEVINE:

They would

Your Honor, that is the primary

13

concern, that is if there is equitable mootness and there's

14

not a review on the merits, they would lose their rights

15

that would otherwise --

16
17

THE COURT:

Well, there's no other concern, right?

I mean, it's just based on equitable mootness, nothing else.

18

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, I think there's also a

19

concern about what's going to happen in the interim is, you

20

know, defendants' move to dismiss based on these releases,

21

for example.

22

that's pending, one of the defense had suggested that the

23

releases apply.

24

it was a different context.

25

would play out and whether cases would be dismissed with

212-267-6868

So there are -- but that wouldn't

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, it's my understanding

that the releases become effective on the effective date.

9

THE COURT:

10

MS. LEVINE:

Right.
So what we want to avoid happening --

11

but if the appeals dismissed without a review on the merits,

12

that effective date is going to come and go, and the Debtors

13

have --

THE COURT:

and how likely that's to happen.

16

MS. LEVINE:

Yes, Your Honor.

So focusing first

17

on the timing of the District Court's decision, Your Honor.

18

Under the plan -- well, first of all, they've argued that

19

it's not just the effective date that may cause equitable

20

mootness.

21

rights to argue that the criminal sentencing, which will

22

happen before the effective date, can be a basis for

23

equitable mootness.

24
25

They have very specifically preserved their

What do we think about that?

2

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, it obviously raises a

3

concern because they've indicated they're going to argue it.

4

But our concern is also, you know, they've said nothing else

5

that's happening before the effective date can constitute

6

equitable mootness, and we've got two concerns about that,

7

Your Honor.

8

stipulation about that doesn't bind the Second Circuit, it

9

doesn't bind other parties.

10

One is, as we've stated, you know, their

We've had other parties that haven't signed the

11

stipulation that have filed oppositions to motions to stay.

12

We've asked multiple times what's happening.

13

gotten a response.

14

someone else might look to and say, you know, is the basis

15

of an equitable mootness argument.

16
17

We haven't

So we don't know what's going on that

But the other thing we're concerned about, Your
Honor, is --

18

THE COURT:

But how could any of those things --

19

I'm sorry to interrupt you.

20

things be substantial consummation?

21

MS. LEVINE:

But how could any of those

Your Honor, I don't think there'll be

22

substantial consummation, but under Second Circuit law, the

23

test is a substantial or comprehensive change in

24

circumstances.

25

that something can happen before substantial consummation

212-267-6868

And, you know, clearly, the Debtors think

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 74
1

that would support equitable mootness because they said they

2

might argue that based on sentencing.

3

And the concern, Your Honor, is it may be that,

4

you know, they have said they've structured this so that

5

they have time between the confirmation and the sentencing

6

to get certain things done, that they want to get certain

7

things done before they are sentenced.

8

clarity on what those things are.

9

We don't have

But we don't know, you know, what pre-effective

10

date activity is going to open the door to sentencing or

11

pre-effective date activity they're going to say is well,

12

you know, say it's transferring assets to NewCo.

13

Transferring assets to NewCo on its own, they might say,

14

well, that can be undone.

15

16

17

asset transfer can't be undone?

18

But then after we get past
Is it

So we don't really know how these things interplay

19

together, which makes us very concerned about when, you

20

know, not just the effective date, but also the sentencing.

21

And also what else is happening and how those things work

22

together so that if we get past sentencing, they're going to

23

come back and say, oh, well, you know, this other pre-

24

effective date activity on its own could be reversed, but

25

now it can be undone.

212-267-6868

Now that bell cannot be unrung.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 75

2

And so, for all these reasons, we have concerns
about these other activities.

3

THE COURT:

But look, the presumption of equitable

4

mootness, which is when their five-step case in the Second

5

Circuit case law comes into effect, is where the plan has

6

been substantially consummated.

7

the distributions under the plan as that, or transfers to be

8

made under the plan that cannot be unwound.

9

Generally, courts focus on

So far, I'm just hearing sort of vague fears, as

10

opposed to anything that actually would give rise to any

11

real risk at all of equitable mootness.

12

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, we think it's a

13

substantial risk because of what the Debtors have said

14

regarding the impact of sentencing, but we also think that

15

the dates here --

16

THE COURT:

Let me -- I mean, Judge Kaplan dealt

17

with this head on in the St. Johnsbury case.

He says to

18

begin with, the government's failure to concede that its

19

appeal would be moot absent a stay does not help those

20

opposing the motion any more than the opponents' failure to

21

concede that the appeal would not be so moot it harms them.

22

Mootness is a doctrine grounded in constitutional

23

considerations designed to limit courts to the resolution of

24

actual controversies, although I think the case law has

25

moved on since then and the focus is really, for equitable

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 76
1

mootness purposes, on the finality of bankruptcy plans.

2

And then he says the parties through additional

3

proceeding, therefore, cannot determine even by agreement

4

whether a case is moot; that is for the Court.

5

But again, we're talking about equitable mootness.

6

I don't think there's any argument that there would be

7

constitutional mootness here, absent probably well after the

8

effective date.

9

concerned, I'm just not seeing it.

10

But as far as equitable mootness is

I mean, again, the case law in the Second Circuit

11

focuses on the five-step test where a plan has been

12

substantially consummated.

13

whether third parties' expectations, i.e., parties who are

14

not parties to the appeal or on either side of the contested

15

issues, would be so harmed that the Court would not exercise

16

what it otherwise has, which is an unflagging duty to

17

exercise its jurisdiction.

18

you undermine the plan my invoking equitable mootness for

19

things that were done before substantial consummation?

20

just seems like a contradiction in terms.

21

MS. LEVINE:

Other circuits focus on simply

And I just...

I mean, how would

It

Your Honor, as I think the St.

22

Johnsbury case pointed out, we're in a difficult position.

23

We don't want to argue against ourselves.

24

equipment mootness would or should apply --

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

We don’t think

No, you don’t have to --

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 77
1

MS. LEVINE:

2

THE COURT:

-- but the Debtors -I'm not asking you to argue against

3

yourselves.

4

to show me that this harm is not just conjectural.

5

But I just don't...

MS. LEVINE:

But I think here you need

Your Honor, the reason we think it's

6

more conjectural is based on what the Debtors have said

7

regarding what they're going to argue about equitable

8

mootness, and they've pinned it, not just to the effective

9

date, but to the sentencing date, which under the plan could

10

be as early as November 1st, which is the day after our

11

argument in the District Court, with the effective date

12

really soon after that, as early as December 8th, a week

13

later.

14

So, you know, talking about the timing and the

15

proposals that they have offered, you know, we think

16

certainly we should at the very least get a stay until the

17

District Court's decision to make sure those dates don't

18

come and go before the District Court has a chance to rule.

19

We are going at --

20

THE COURT:

Let me focus on that point.

If it is

21

clear that the District Court is going to rule before

22

substantial consummation of the plan, before the effective

23

date, why is a stay needed?

24

other parties who are in support of the plan be precluded

25

from laying the groundwork in case the conditions to the

212-267-6868

Why should the Debtors and the

2

setting up the trusts, et cetera?

I raised this point, you know, the first time that

4

a stay was asked on an emergency basis, and I'm still having

5

a hard time seeing how that works.

6

looks at Judge McMahon's order, which I'm not doing, but

it's as much in support for that view also, that there

really run the risk of equitable mootness until after the

And frankly, if one

11

12

Now, I think you acknowledged that the stay you're

seeking would have to be a stay of everything, but could

things, those are things we would have to take under

consideration or have authority to agree to any other

6

What transactions out of the ordinary course do you believe

7

they confirmation order authorizes now before the effective

9

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, the confirmation order

10

grants a broad authorization to engage in the transactions

11

that they need to implement the plan.

12

problem is we're in the dark on exactly what they're doing.

13

We want to maintain the status quo because equitable

14

mootness is an existential threat to our appeal.

15

maintaining the status quo is the only way to protect

16

against that risk of equitable mootness.

or at least something else.

It has to be a real risk, coupled with other things,

212-267-6868

Now, maybe that something else

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 81
1

here may simply be the significance of ruling on the merits

2

of the appeal.

3

But it would still seem to me that if you had --

4

and this is repeated in numerous rulings -- there's one by

5

Judge Briccetti in U.S. Bank National Association v.

6

Windstream Holdings, Inc., 2020 U.S. District LEXIS 137183.

7

Merely invoking equitable mootness as the Appellants have

8

done here -- a risk that is present in any post-confirmation

9

appeal of a Chapter 11 plan -- is not sufficient to

10

demonstrate irreparable harm.

11

this kind of argument for every such request, it would be

12

forced to review nearly every bankruptcy appeal on an

13

expedited basis and, of course, grant the motion if some

14

other factor were established.

15

Calpine Corp., 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 217 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Jan.

you can't just say there's a risk of equitable mootness and

20

on what that risk is and how real it is, and then see how

21

it's tied into the other factors.

22

You have to actually focus

And I'm still not seeing it as far as between now

23

and a date within a reasonable time after Judge McMahon's

24

ruling, which I think the drafters of the rule have said is

25

at a minimum 14 days.

212-267-6868

And that would be just a stay of the

Page 82

effective date.

I mean, there's no discussion about how

2

this plan could be substantially consummated before then.

3

And even then, there's the issue of who are the

4

people who are harmed by a continued appeal?

And if we're

5

focusing just on the Sacklers, I don’t think that's the type

6

of harm for the shareholder released parties; that's the

7

type of harm that the courts recognize is a basis for

8

equitable mootness, because they're in the heart of the

9

issues that are on appeal.

There would have to be other

10

third parties, legitimate parties who aren't in the dispute

11

who were being harmed.

12

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, you know, this sort of

13

goes back a little bit to where I started, where we think

the harm is the complete elimination of claims that becomes

I'll ask the Debtors what they believe

they're authorized to do before the effective date to lead

to the argument that the plan is substantially consummated

and, therefore, it would be inequitable for third parties,

before me, up at least until the effective date, would lead

5

the Second Circuit to find that the appeal was rendered

equitably moot.

7

It's just -- there's no effective date, there's no

substantial consummation, there's no sale that's happening

9

before the effective date, there's no other transaction.

10

And it just -- it doesn't fit even within the actually

focuses on the heavy showing someone has to make against

elimination of these rights.

individual non-debtor conduct for their own misconduct,

breaching a duty directly to the Plaintiffs, such as the

cases that -- the complaints that we cited in our brief,

which allege claims under state consumer protection

statutes, common law fraud, negligence, RICO.

7

number of claims that have been asserted along those lines

8

that allege direct participation and direct liability, based

9

on the individual Defendants' own misconduct.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

There's a

And that misconduct would be

11

misconduct in being an officer or director or shareholder of

12

the Debtors?

13

MS. LEVINE:

In the cases that we've cited, yes.

14

I believe the individual defendants were in those roles.

15

But the allegations are that they'd reached -- is not just a

16

sort of veiled piercing, breach of fiduciary duty,

17

imputation of the company's conduct, but that the

18

individuals had breached their own duty and engaged in their

19

own misconduct, making them directly liable to the

20

Plaintiffs.

21

THE COURT:

Have you found any of those cases or

22

any evidence from the confirmation hearing that shows that

23

those allegations don't substantially or entirely overlap

24

with the showing that would be necessary for piercing the

25

corporate veil or other causes of action that the Debtors

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 90
1

would have?

2

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, the factual allegations

3

may overlap, but I mean, I think this gets to where we

4

disagree with what the proper scope of the non-debtor

5

releases are, and that is something that we think should --

6

is an important issue that should be reviewed, and one of

7

the reasons why we're seeking a stay pending appeal.

8
9

You know, when Metromedia talked about the cases
that have -- the rare cases that have allowed these

10

releases, they were in circumstances that were more limited.

11

They were in class actions, like Drexel, which is this is

12

not -- are aware they were, you know, more surely derivative

13

claims, such as fraudulent -- you know, claims that were

14

duplicate fraudulent transfer claims, like in Madoff or

15

Tronox or in Manville I, where it was directly against the

16

asset of the estate, and that in the claim was a secondary

17

insured that was derivative of the primary insureds' claim,

18

the debtor was the primary insured.

19

So we think that question of whether overlapping

20

factual allegations is enough to put this within the scope

21

of a non-debtor release and whether that's the appropriate

22

scope is an important question, as a question that should be

23

addressed on appellate review.

24

THE COURT:

25

that's correct.

212-267-6868

Well, no, I've already said I believe

I'm just trying to figure out here -- and

Veritext Legal Solutions

this is in a different context; this is balancing the harms

2

-- the right of someone to pursue, which on the facts are

duplicate claims or overlapping claims, is so strong,

4

particularly when they would receive a recovery, at least

caused by the delay.

Page 92

as I can tell -- and I did the best I could to cabin the

2

release to make it clear that they would not expand beyond

3

that -- that the people that you're looking out for would

4

get any recovery whatsoever in the context where the

5

settlement was not in place and there would be a litigation

6

free-for-all.

7

Again, you have the United States getting it

9

their claims.

You have individual states litigating

And then that's up against a class action

10

lawyer or two or three, back in the MDL, where there already

11

was, by the substantial private side in the MDL, a

12

settlement for a lesser amount, namely $3 billion.

13

So I'm just having a hard time seeing, other than

14

the intellectual desire to clarify this issue one way or the

15

other, how the people who would object to the release of

16

their claims are harmed more than the people who would be

17

receiving the benefit of the plan distributions.

18

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, I think we have a

19

disagreement about what the evidence shows about that.

20

there's also a harm from having that choice taken away, and

21

what we view of a violation of due process rights to be

22

forced into a settlement that one does not agree to.

23

THE COURT:

But

Well, the parties you're speaking on

24

behalf of certainly had notice of the confirmation hearing

25

and the right to hire a lawyer to make that very argument,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 93
1

which is a lot easier to make than hiring a lawyer to

2

compete against 48 states and the Debtors and the lawyers

3

and their clients who make up the Ad Hoc Committee of

4

Personal Injury Claimants.

5

If they're not prepared even to hire a lawyer to

6

fight the plan, how do you assume that they're going to even

7

undertake the litigation that you want to preserve for them?

8
9

MS. LEVINE:

Your Honor, the premise that there

was adequate notice, again, you know, we disagree with.

10

That's part of our objection.

11

And this is part of the reason why we think this needs

12

appellate review.

13

And we know you disagree.

And you know, there are parties who have filed

14

claims that would be precluded.

15

There are numerous cases listed in the preliminary

16

injunction.

17
18

THE COURT:

But they haven't objected to the plan.

And you're not going to represent --

19

MS. LEVINE:

20

THE COURT:

21

We think we've shown that.

Mr. Hartman has.
You're not going to represent them in

the litigation, right?

22

MS. LEVINE:

No, Your Honor.

And of course, the

23

United States Trustee is here not representing individuals,

24

but representing the public interest in making sure that the

25

bankruptcy system isn't abused.

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

First, I just

22

would like to touch on -- because I think it's an important

23

point in context of the questions that Your Honor has raised

24

-- the attempts that were made to try to resolve this matter

25

prior to this hearing.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 95

I think the key point, which Your Honor said in

2

framing the question for us, was that it would be my wish

3

that the schedule for the appeal is a reasonable one and

4

does not run the risk of causing Norma's harm to creditors.

5

I'm not going to quote every word you said, but the key

6

point was, with a second potential look at the Appellate

7

Court as to whether any further stay is necessary.

8

And I think that that is the point here where,

9

with what we -- what I described earlier as our fallback

10

position, that we are seeking to have a stay consistent with

11

Rule 8025 that would at least take the process through a

12

decision from the District Court, and then give a period of

13

time for a higher court to decide whether to further extend

14

the stay.

15
16

The -THE COURT:

Can I represent you on that point, Mr.

Gold?

17

MR. GOLD:

18

THE COURT:

Sure.
When talking to the U.S. Trustee's

19

counsel, I made a distinction between a stay of the

20

effective date, or the occurrence of the effective date

21

under the order, which would be a specific condition to the

22

effective date in the order and in the plan, and a stay of

23

the order in its entirety.

24

latter might be warranted, but not the former.

25

MR. GOLD:

212-267-6868

And it seemed to me that the
I mean --

Well --

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 96

2

THE COURT:

-- the other way around.

That the

latter would not be warranted, but the former might be.

3

MR. GOLD:

I think that a proper consideration of

4

that question, Your Honor, requires a consideration of the

5

effect of sentencing.

6

something that may not -- that is clearly contemplated under

7

the confirmation order, although it may not be completely

8

clear how it -- whether it arises under the plan or under a

9

separate stipulation.

10

And that is the -- and that is

But the connection, Your Honor -- and I think the

11

Debtor has been very clear about this -- is that they are

12

going to press that once sentencing has occurred, they will

13

be suffering immense harms if they are not permitted to then

14

consummate the plan and to enter into the transactions under

15

the plan.

16

meaningful stay of the consummation of the plan, as Your

17

Honor has posited, there needs to be a delay of the

18

sentencing as well.

19

And so that, therefore, to enable there to be a

If the Debtors can posit -- now, right now I'm

20

positing what their argument is going to be, and I realize

21

that that's a somewhat shaky limb to be on, but that's

22

pretty much where I understand their position is going to

23

be, so that to prevent the possibility of a shipwreck or

24

major harms occurring if there is sentencing and not a --

25

and they can't consummate the plan, we need to have a delay

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 97
1

in the sentencing.

2

If the sentencing is delayed and concurrent with

3

that a stay of the effective date of the plan, we believe

4

then Your Honor's analysis is correct, that that should be

5

sufficient to maintain the status quo and prevent there

6

being a substantial consummation that would be the predicate

7

for an equitable mootness argument.

8
9

Now, even there, we're at a slight disadvantage
because, as the U.S. Trustee has said, we don't know exactly

10

what the Debtors would be doing and it would be a lot

11

cleaner for us to accept this, if the Debtors would

12

straightforwardly say, we agree with you; nothing else that

13

is happening here would create a predicate for equitable

14

mootness, along the lines of the assurances they gave to the

15

parties in connection with the advance order, so that we

16

would have a basis of knowing that there wasn't something

17

going on that we're not aware of and that in our saying we

18

don't think there's a problem, someone plays a gotcha game

19

and says, yes, they weren't aware of this and that happened.

20

But based on our assessment, what we're aware of

21

being contemplated, that's the one critical point that we

22

have to add.

23

a delay in the effective date of the plan, which would

24

happen together because the effective date of the plan can't

25

occur without sentencing in the first instance.

212-267-6868

There has to be a delay in sentencing and then

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 98
1

And so the reason we were unable to reach any kind

2

of resolution with the Debtors in trying to resolve this

3

short of having this lengthy hearing today was that they

4

insisted that any resolution we reached with them had to

5

include a date certain for the sentencing to occur.

6

And so that's why we've been unable to reach an

7

assessment with them, because they kept including the

8

sentencing, reserving their right to argue that the

9

occurrence of the sentencing would create an equitable

mootness problem, either by itself or because of what would

be entailed afterwards.

asking you to say things that are contrary to your later

argument that sentencing wouldn't render the plan moot.

all I can say is that you wouldn't be held to those things

18

in the future, and I'm sure the Debtors have thought of them

But

516-608-2400

Page 99
1

the agreement has this provision that they're supposed to go

2

get sentenced.

3

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, as I understand it --

4

and again, this will be something that the Debtors are

5

saying this is argument that they're going to make.

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. GOLD:

Right.
And if they say before the Court now

8

that they would not make this argument, that might be a lot

9

cleaner.

But as I understand it, their position is going to

10

be that once sentencing occurs, they are no longer able to

11

operate as the companies that are currently constituted.

12

That because they will be sentenced, they will be unable to

13

sell product, to receive Medicare, or contributions and

14

other things.

15

with an immediate shutdown, a corporate catastrophe, unless

16

they are able to go ahead with the restructurings that are

17

contemplated under the plan, and so then that's why those

18

two will be tied together.

19

And that therefore, they will be threatened

Now, I should say that, Your Honor, we would love

20

nothing more than to engage with the Debtors and to say is

21

there a way to allow this to go forward, to allow some

22

corporate restructuring to take place, to allow some

23

payments to go to the victims of Purdue and the Sacklers

that are supposed to be receiving payments under the plan.

25

We're not trying to -- that's not our goal, to

Page 100
1

prevent those types of assistance from happening.

2

there is a way for the parties to on one hand permit some of

3

these things to go forward, while on the other hand

4

preserving the right of appeal, we are very -- we have

5

always been open to having that discussion of trying to make

6

propositions along those lines to the parties.

7

something along the lines of the emergency relief fund that

8

was proposed during the case, but that did not occur.

9

Something like that that could perhaps take place to allow

10

And if

Or perhaps

parties to get relief.

11

What we perceive is that the parties who have

12

refused to engage with us on this point are doing so because

13

they want to be able to hold up the possibility of relief as

14

their ticket to getting an equitable mootness that would

15

preclude further appeals.

16

So if there is a way of managing to separate these

17

things through stipulation, or an order, or something that

18

allows some of these things to occur -- and I think Your

19

Honor is right that perhaps they are not at all necessarily

20

as abstract principles linked, but we believe that -- our

21

understanding is that the way this plan has been drafted and

22

that this plan has been put together -- and this is a plan

23

that has been drafted and put together with a clear strategy

24

of preserving it through equitable mootness -- that the

25

effort has been made to tie these things together so that

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 101
1

they could not be disentangled, and so that starting down

2

this road would necessarily create the predicates for

3

equitable mootness.

4

then pulls in the restructuring and then the other matters

5

that occur there.

And that starts with the sentencing and

6

I will just note then with respect to the timing,

7

the plea agreement took place, I'm going to say, in October

8

or so of 2020, and was held in abeyance for a period of time

9

to allow further proceedings before this Court, confirmation

10

and other such things.

11

are at least opaque to us, put in a further delay for them

12

to do certain preparations prior to the sentencing

13

occurring.

14

The Debtors then, for reasons that

So it's pretty clear to us that the sentencing,

15

which we are not asking to be undone but can be held in

16

abeyance while the issues under the plan receive proper

17

appellate review, and so holding those matters off, the

18

Debtor has managed to stay in this presentencing period for

19

over a year now and contemplated further staying.

20

So we believe that the most effective and simplest

21

way to preserve the status quo is to have, as Your Honor

22

said, a stay that includes the effective date plus the

23

sentencing to avoid the shipwreck scenario.

24

alternative, we're perfectly -- we are desirous of trying to

25

come up with a better way to allow some benefits to go

Or in the

516-608-2400

Page 102
1

through, if it will not -- if the parties can agree that

2

doing that will not equitably moot an appeal.

3

But so far, we have not received serious

4

engagements on that.

5

try to use the very real need of these victims to receive

6

money as a kind of hostage situation where they can't get

7

their money unless our appeals are irrevocably denied

8

through (indiscernible) risk.

9

THE COURT:

10

MR. GOLD:

And apparently, the parties prefer to

Okay.
I will not -- I will move on, then,

11

Your Honor.

12

because as I think Your Honor said, we agree that the

13

standard is sufficiently flexible, that we've made enough of

14

a showing with the merits of the appeals that we wish to put

15

forward, to satisfy the test in the Second Circuit.

16

concede that we have to meet several factors of the prongs,

17

and it's not simply enough to have succeeded on one of them.

18

But we believe that we've made a sufficient showing on those

19

to move on to the other prongs as well.

20

I will not touch on the merits particularly,

And we

I would just note that the irreparable harm that

21

we will suffer here is the deprivation of the rights of the

22

moving states to bring their independent actions under state

23

law against the Sacklers.

24

those claims is certainly real enough to satisfy any

25

requirements that it not simply be mere equitable mootness,

212-267-6868

And that the potential loss of

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 103
1

but equitable mootness plus a consequence, that that's the

2

consequence here.

3

And then there are other cases also raised in the

4

briefs that we believe are also compelling, that says that

5

any time a state is prevented from enforcing its laws, it

6

has also suffered an irreparable harm.

7

we believe, certainly satisfy the requirement that there be

8

a form of irreparable harm shown here.

9

Those two together,

I will then turn, if Your Honor doesn't have

10

questions, to the question of the balancing of the harms,

11

which is the next factor here.

12

It feels to us that an awful lot of the arguments

13

that the stay opponents have put forward basically can be

14

described from the movie, "Blazing Saddles", where the

15

sheriff who finds himself in a difficult spot -- played by

16

Cleavon Little -- points a gun at his own head and manages

17

to convince the parties that the threat to himself that he

18

is posing are sufficient to allow him to be extricated from

19

that position.

20

because the harms that the stay opponents are positing here

21

are ones that they are themselves creating to a large

22

extent.

23

And the reason I mention that here is

So first, as I've touched on already, is the

24

question of the sentencing.

25

going to be that if sentencing occurs, but they can't

212-267-6868

I believe their argument is

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 104
1

proceed, they will suffer harm.

2

for them to seek to defer sentencing until the appeals have

3

run their course.

4

Well, the simple answer is

Second, we have these arguments that the Sacklers

5

have the right to terminate the agreement if a stay is

6

entered.

7

Honor.

8

on October 14th on certification of a direct appeal, there

9

was another issue regarding a Sackler termination right.

And I find this an outrageous suggestion, Your
I will note that during the hearing that took place

10

Mr. Huebner stated emphatically to this Court that

11

of course he had a waiver of that Sackler termination right,

12

and that he would not be coming into the court without

13

having a waiver of that termination right in his pocket.

14

And the reason for that was self-evident.

15

think that Purdue would put in jeopardy the Sackler

16

settlement agreement, the centerpiece of the plan?

17

is what Purdue is arguing right here.

18

Sackler a walk right.

19

How could one

But that

That they granted the

I will note that this walk right was slipped into

20

the agreement at literally the last moment, while the

21

confirmation trial was proceeding, after the evidentiary

22

portion of the confirmation trial had closed, after all the

23

testimony about how wonderful a settlement this was had

24

already been placed on the record.

25

And I will also note that Purdue did not consider

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 105
1

this walk right to be significant enough to advise the Court

2

and other parties, oh, by the way, we've posted an amended

3

Sackler settlement agreement, and it happens to contain a

4

provision that will allow the Sacklers to terminate this if

5

there's a stay pending appeal, which a possibility of

6

request for a stay was clearly contemplated by everyone.

7

So, now, how could this be?

How is it possible

8

that all the tremendous lawyers representing the stay

9

opponents voluntarily put in jeopardy the centerpiece of the

10

plan?

Not because they were confident that there would be

11

no appeal, nor that there would not be a motion for a stay

12

pending appeal.

13

expect that the Sacklers would spurn all the benefits that

14

they get under this plan and actually exercise this right,

15

and rather, because they intended to use this provision as a

16

means to bludgeon the courts into denying a stay.

17

submit that that should not be permitted here.

It has to be that they could not seriously

And we

18

Second argument that they put forward relates to

19

the attorneys' fees that they themselves are incurring and

20

will incur during the period of the stay.

21

is also an outrageous point.

22

that the size of the fees that they generate were causing

23

harms to victims of Purdue and the Sacklers, they ought to

24

be finding ways to limit their fees.

MR. GOLD:

And

3

it's a complicated issue because this is apples and oranges,

5

type, difficult to quantify, and so the Court has to engage

6

in the kind of balancing.

7

here will not -- we're not disputing that it really occurs,

8

but this harm is one that the parties have lived with

9

throughout the case because there were important legal

The harms that we have here are different in

principles or other things that were taking place.

11

we're suggesting that it does not outweigh here the

12

preservation of our appellate rights.

13

THE COURT:

And

Well, again, that may be the case

14

through a relatively short period after what would normally

15

be the effective date, because distributions in some measure

16

would be made into the trust, but not out of the trust, for

17

a period after the effective date.

18

the more the delay really counts, because there comes a

19

point when (indiscernible) claims start being liquidated and

20

the NOAT procedures are established, and at that point, the

21

money really does start going out.

22

MR. GOLD:

23

THE COURT:

24

But the longer you go,

Well, I -Have your clients and the Debtors

talked about when that point is likely to be?

25

MR. GOLD:

212-267-6868

Well, as I said, Your Honor, what we

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 109
1

have attempted to do with the Debtors is to find a way to --

2

and again, using the model that was engaged with the trust

3

advance motion to have the parties agree to allow various

4

steps to take place, including the ones that Your Honor has

5

listed -- and we have had, I have to say, little engagement

6

or appetite for engagement from the Debtors or the other

7

parties in terms of being able to parse.

8
9

I do agree that part of the benefit of having the
stay be limited to the period of time that we've discussed

10

in terms of getting us to the next level is that we can

11

analyze more concretely what steps are going to occur,

12

rather than looking at and allowing the next courts to be

13

able to focus on what issues would be arising then, and what

14

could be concretely happening then, and weighing that

15

against the harms that might occur.

16

It is certainly for the purposes of the District

17

Court's ruling, that by all evidence, Judge McMahon is

18

keenly aware of the importance of having a decision done

19

quickly.

20

because she was aware of this, she was able to insist on a

21

briefing schedule to enable that all to work.

22

And frankly, again, the other benefit is that

And if we are going to the next court, should that

23

be necessary, then, again, the Second Circuit could be in a

24

position to condition a stay upon an expedited briefing

25

schedule before the Second Circuit, which no lower court

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 110
1

could meaningfully be in a position to impose on the Second

2

Circuit, which they could do themselves.

3

So we posit that the harm for this period of time

4

is not sufficient to outweigh the importance of the

5

appellate rights that are being preserved, and that the

6

issue may have to be revisited by another court with its own

7

timetable in place and depending on where the matters stand

8

at that point.

9

And as I said, we are more than willing to try to

10

work with these parties to find a way to allow transactions

11

to occur, to allow even payments to go to needy parties, if

12

there can be a way to structure that to not affect the

13

appellate rights.

14

So now I turn Your Honor to the public interest

15

component of the process.

16

in the public interest that this plan be fully tested on

17

appeal, not -- the Debtors seem to sometimes have the

18

position that the only appeal that is meaningful here is

19

appeal to the District Court.

front of the Second Circuit already, had the Debtors agreed

21

to certification of a direct appeal.

22
23

THE COURT:

This case could have been in

But they chose not to.

Well, the Circuit would have had to

have taken it too.

24
25

We submit that it is manifestly

MR. GOLD:

That's true, Your Honor.

I'm just

saying that the Debtor -- that we didn't reach that point.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 111
1

And part of the reason why we didn't reach that point was

2

that the Debtors at that hearing insisted that it was

3

important that we go to the full process of first review

4

from the Bankruptcy Court, and then review from the Court of

5

Appeals.

6

And so we want to -- now that we are on that path,

7

we want to make sure that all levels of appeal are preserved

8

and not booted out through equitable mootness.

9

submit that that is manifestly in the public interest, and

And we

10

that it is against the public interest that parties be

11

permitted to design plans to create equitable mootness

12

factors in them as a means of avoiding review.

13

Honor, I can state that I received emails today of CLA

14

programs that are already being designed and marketed to

15

teach bankruptcy lawyers how to design plans that provide

16

non-consensual releases and that can be protected by

17

equitable mootness.

18

whole is watching this, and it is critical --

2

with this plan at all.

3

just discussed, the public interest in avoiding harm,

4

tangible harm, to the victims increases with time.

5

you're just ignoring that when you talk about the public

6

interest.

7

That has nothing to do

And it would seem to me that as we

And

And again, it's well-recognized that one issue,

8

one element of the public interest, is the finality of

9

reorganizations.

So I think it's much more complicated than

10

you're saying here, but I also think that what you're

11

arguing for now is well beyond what you had been arguing

12

for, which is some form of a stay through a ruling by the

13

District Court.

14

matters through a determination by the Supreme Court, which

15

could be in 2024.

16

Because now you're talking about staying

on to the higher levels.

13

just goes back to the balancing of the harms.

14

MR. GOLD:

We're talking about more money,
And to me that

Well, Your Honor, the -- I would just

15

clarify a few points of what you have stated.

16

that the appealing states participated in the design of many

17

features of the plan, and that we do believe that a lot of

18

those features of the plan are salutary and are ones that we

19

agreed to together.

20

always being negotiated based on the predicate that other

21

issues, principally the releases, could also be

22

satisfactorily resolved, and unfortunately, they were not.

23

I do agree

But that was always -- those were

The -- I will also note that the issues that arise

24

vis-a-vis the Sacklers, are not solely issues relating to

25

the amount of money that can be paid.

212-267-6868

Although that is

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 114
1

certainly an important component of it, but there are other

2

issues regarding, for instance, the Sackler agreement to

3

have their name taken off of various institutions, about the

4

scope of the -- of when documents can be available in the

5

document depository -- or repository and other things that

6

are not, that take this case beyond a mere matter of money.

7

And I again state that the appealing states are

8

highly anxious to try to find ways to reduce the burdens on

9

the ones that Your Honor has identified rather than to hold

10

them hostage as a means of avoiding appellate

11

(indiscernible) important question.

12

all of these are -- all the things that Your Honor stated

13

are matters of public concern.

14

where you have what as Your Honor has identified as non-

15

frivolous, serious questions regarding the permissible scope

16

of a -- of releases granted pursuant to a confirmation

17

order, having those issues clarified on appeal we submit is

18

a compelling public interest, notwithstanding the other

19

matters that Your Honor has identified.

20

21

think, pretty eloquently laid out in the declarations of Ms.

I'm hoping I'm pronouncing that right, J-U-A-I-R-E,

appreciate what you've said, Mr. Gold, about the State's

2

willingness to work with the appellees on intermediate steps

3

that minimize that countervailing harm that they detail.

4

I guess the point that I need to press is, are the

5

three states prepared to accept some risk of equitable

6

mootness as part of those steps.

7

apparently takes the position that it's not, which seems

8

rather bizarre to me and contrary to the case law.

9

But I

10

by saying of course we can't take a risk of equitable

11

mootness, or is it willing to take some risk?

12

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, our -- we -- first,

13

we are agreeing to accept some -- our issue is not -- our

14

view is not identical to the U.S. Trustee, which as you've

15

obviously seen from the briefing that has been submitted.

16

We have not taken a separate appeal from the advance order.

17

We're not pursuing that.

18

We are accepting that.

While there is in theory some risk of equitable

19

mootness from that, we don't consider it to be a significant

20

enough one that we are pursuing that.

21

exercising some judgment in terms of what risks of equitable

22

mootness we are willing to take and which not.

23

And so we are

We also recognize that the framework that was

24

Now, we recognize that that is not bulletproof, that it's --

It would seem to me very hard for anyone to rule that it was

equitable to hold something as causing mootness when the

very party that would benefit from that had stipulated that

21

it wouldn't.

That would seem --

same in my analysis of that question, although it's more

2

meaningful coming from Your Honor than it is from a mere

lawyer.

4

parties -- what we have been proposing was that the parties

5

stipulate that they would not seek to use the steps that we

6

are suggesting that we would be willing to negotiate with

7

them as the basis for an equitable mootness argument.

8
9

The point I'm making is that if we -- so, if the

And while that is not nearly as bullet proof in
the context of payments going to parties as it is in the

10

context of establishing trusts or other such matters, we are

11

certainly willing to seriously consider taking the risk that

12

some other party might raise those things, notwithstanding

13

the party's stipulation.

14

parties stipulate to that would go a long way to allow that

15

to occur.

16

But we think that having the

That's far from the situation where if we say

17

we're willing to allow certain things to go forward knowing

18

that the other parties, like say with the sentencing where

19

the Debtors have said let there be no mistake.

20

sentencing occurs, we are going to insist that that has

21

equitable mootness concerns.

22

analysis for us than something where the Debtors have

stipulated that they are not going to raise equitable

24

mootness.

That's a very different

No, that's fine.

I understand your

Okay?
MR. GOLD:

Okay, Your Honor.

The -- Mr. Goldman

8

is going to be addressing the issues regarding the

9

declarations that have been submitted, so I will not further

10

extend this hearing by stating them myself.

11

unless Your Honor has any questions, I don't think --

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. GOLD:

14

THE COURT:

15

And the --

Well --- there's anything --- are one of you going to address the

bond issue?

16

MR. GOLD:

I can do that, Your Honor.

The -- we

17

submit that this case is governed by the plain language of

18

the rule that says a bond or other security is not required

19

when an appeal is taken by the United States, its officer,

20

its agency, or by direction of any department of the federal

21

government.

22

And we have here the -- that is our circumstance.

23

We are dealing with appeals that have been simultaneously or

24

substantially simultaneously filed by the U.S. Trustee,

25

which fits the category of the United States, its officer

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 119
1

agency, and by the states.

We are raising substantially

2

similar issues, or I would say that the U.S. Trustee has

3

issued a broad panoply of issues that include the issues

4

that we are raising on our appeal, and that based on that,

5

no bond can be required on this consolidated appeal.

6

Certainly if the -- if no bond is applied or a

7

stay is granted for the U.S. Trustee, there should be no

8

bond for -- because the same stay will be in effect, and

9

it's the same stay that will be protecting the U.S. as well

10

as the states.

11

We also -- I don't have much to add to our

12

argument that there are other cases that recognize an

13

analogy between sovereign states and the U.S., although the

14

rule does not specifically mention them, and that therefore

15

finds it inappropriate to impose bonds on the states by

16

analogy.

17

submit that the cases that the stay opponents founded were

18

-- had nothing to do with our circumstances, had to do with

19

bonds being required of non-government actors, and provide

20

no illumination on what the Court should be doing.

21

But that's -- though we finally -- we would simply

THE COURT:

So what do you make of the committee

22

notes to Rule 8007(c) and (d), the 2014 committee notes,

23

which state that (c) and (d) retain the provisions of the

24

former rule to condition the granting of relief on the

25

posting of a bond by the Appellant except when that party is

1

a federal government entity?

2

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, I will make two

3

points here.

I think that that -- first, I would say that

4

that comment is not directed to the circumstance where there

5

are simultaneous appeals by multiple parties, and that the

6

-- I would secondly point out that there is substantial case

7

law saying that what the Court should be looking at is the

8

language of the rule itself rather than the committee notes

9

that provide distinctions that were not included in the

10

language of the rule itself, and that because the U.S.

11

Trustee is entitled to an unbonded appeal here, it --

12

there's -- there should be no bond.

13

having an additional bond when it's the same appeal.

14

THE COURT:

There'll be no point in

So the general rationale for exempting

15

the United States from the bonding requirement is that most

16

judgments, and this is consistent with 28 U.S.C. 24

17

something -- the U.S. Trustee cites it -- is that the United

18

States is good for it because it's a judgment against the

19

United States, and the United States is always good for it.

20

Your interpretation of this rule would mean that

21

if there was a judgment against the United States and

22

against third parties, the third parties would have the

23

benefit of the United States being good for its portion of

24

it, and that they would have -- they could just have a free

25

ride on that, and the Plaintiff should take the risk?

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure what the

judgment would --

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. GOLD:

5

THE COURT:

No, I'm just talking about --- would be --- your interpretation of the rule,

6

which would include, I think, that scenario, which doesn't

7

seem to me to be a -- an interpretation that Congress would

8

want.

9

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, when -- since we are

10

dealing here with states, and I don't believe that there's

11

any serious issue regarding collectability --

12

THE COURT:

Actually, Judge Posner thought there

13

was in Lightfoot v. Walker, 797 F.2d 505 and 506 through 07

14

(7th Cir. 1986).

15

issue as to what we've just been talking about is the

16

balance of the harms, and that balance may become

17

significantly greater as time goes on.

18

Debtors have attempted to quantify that in the DelConte

19

declaration.

So, anyway.

But I guess there is the

Before then, the

20

But I'm not sure -- well, it's really a question

21

for the Debtors as to the delay by three months, what does

22

that mean?

23

back end than the front end where there's significant loss.

24

But I don't think there's any doubt that the cost for a

25

lengthy delay of, you know, several months to a year or two

212-267-6868

But I think what it means is it's more on the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 122
1

really is dramatic here in terms of dollars and cents.

2

it would seem to me that, as time goes by, the need for a

3

bond grows dramatically to offset the vindication or not of

4

the Appellant's right on appeal.

5

MR. GOLD:

So

Well, Your Honor, I guess that gets

6

back to the point that we discussed before why it may make

7

more sense to have Your Honor stay -- take us through the

8

relative short term when the costs are relatively contained

9

and lower and allow a later court that -- a higher court

10

that can have a better sense of how long it will be taking

11

on the appeal resolve that issue.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

20

MR. GOLDMAN:

I have nothing

May I be up next?

Yes, that's fine.
Thank you, Your Honor.

I first

21

wanted to just for Connecticut adopt the arguments that we

22

made by Mr. Gold for Washington and affirm that, you know,

23

the principal form of relief that we are seeking at this

24

point is our fallback, or what was previously described as a

25

fallback position.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 123
1

We are looking for a stay until 14 days after

2

Judge McMahon issues her ruling, which I would note may very

3

well come after December 8th, which is what the Debtors

4

described as the earliest point when the effective date can

5

occur, which is seven days after the 75th day after the date

6

of the confirmation order.

7

And it seems unlikely that it will come after that

8

date because we have oral argument, as Your Honor knows, on

9

November 30th, and Judge McMahon has advised us that she

10

starts a two-defendant criminal trial on December 7th.

11

that would give her less than a week to get out what I would

12

anticipate is a very complex decision.

13

that it would likely come after that trial has concluded.

14

But I just want to circle --

15
16

THE COURT:

What's on trial?

So

So we would project

It's oral argument.

Oh, the criminal trial.

17

MR. GOLDMAN:

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. GOLDMAN:

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes, correct, Your Honor.
Well -That's what we were advised.
Okay.
And if I could just circle back for

22

a moment to this apprehension that we have of equitable

23

mootness based on the Debtor's indication that they'll argue

24

the criminal sentencing will, you know, be the fulcrum for

25

that in a stipulation that was filed with the District Court

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 124
1

on October 20th that dealt with their commitment not to

2

argue that anything pursuant to the advance order or in the

3

preparatory stages leading up to the effective date, they

4

would not argue with the basis for equitable mootness.

5

It carved out in paragraph 2 the following

6

provision.

7

sentencing of Perdue or the effect or consequences of such

8

sentencing on these or other appeals.

9

have signaled the intention to argue that, and I think the

10

stay of the confirmation order would be the most effective

11

way to prevent that from happening.

12

The stipulation does not address the criminal

So currently, they

The reason I say that is because the plea

13

agreement itself provides that the parties, meaning Perdue

14

and USDOJ will agree to request that the sentencing hearing

15

take place no earlier than 75 days following the date of

16

confirmation.

17

that if there is a stay of the confirmation order, there

18

would be no reason for any party of the Debtors or the

19

United States to request a scheduling of the sentencing

20

hearing for the very reason that the Debtors have argued

21

that if they are sentenced and thereby become a convicted

22

felon, that would put their continued operation at jeopardy.

23

This contemplates a joint request.

And so

So I think the most effective way to deal with

24

that would be to stay the order.

25

touched on this as part of the calculus of determining

212-267-6868

And I think Mr. Gold also

whether there was irreparable harm.

We contend the Court

2

should not only consider the risk of equitable mootness, but

3

the consequences that would ensue to the states if their

4

causes of action are eliminated, which is unquestionably

5

their property, not property of the estate.

6

equitable mootness scenario, that property will have been

7

taken away without appellate review of whether the taking

8

was proper.

And in an

I know Your Honor has concluded that the states

will likely do better or will do better financially under

11

the plan than they would if they were permitted to go

12

against the Sacklers and other third parties.

13

not account for the character of these release police power

14

claims as a deterrent to future wrongdoers and simply

15

assumes incorrectly that their value is purely financial.

would restrict -- eventually, maybe not automatically as I'm

told, but eventually it would lead to the termination of

6

their licenses and the ability to do business unless the

7

properties could be transferred to NewCo at that point.

But as I had indicated, Your Honor, if Your Honor
stays the order for the period we're requesting, it is

10

highly unlikely that that criminal sentencing will take

Let me move on to Mr. Gard.

And in

11

paragraph 3, again, this really goes over what Mr. DelConte

12

testified to, and that it's his belief that a delay, though

13

materially, would give us Perdue's residual value and

talking about the uncertainty of the bankruptcy process.

requesting.

21

prediction that as a result of the delayed distributions

22

during the stay, it's quite possible that additional

23

Americans will die, and then suggest that a stay will allow

24

Americans to needlessly die, who would not have died but for

25

a stay.

212-267-6868

And in paragraphs 14 and 16, he offers the

Page 130
1

Now, this is obvious argument as well and not

2

fact.

I mean, evidence of widespread death as a result of

3

stay of limited duration has got to be based --

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. GOLDMAN:

6

THE COURT:

Well, again --- on more than --- it depends on what the length of

7

the stay is.

I just -- look, on your first point, the only

8

example that he gives for the effect of a stay is if the

9

plea goes forward without the plan being implemented.

And

10

to me that is a meaningful effect.

11

talking about other effects on keeping senior employees, I

12

agree with you.

13

To the extent he's

I don't think he's really -- unlike Mr. DelConte,

14

he's not really in a position, you know, other than anyone

15

else or different than anyone else to talk about that point.

16

But on the plea point, I understand his point.

17

And then, look, the testimony is based upon I

18

think an undisputed fact that roughly 200 opioid-related

19

overdose deaths occur, and that those deaths have been

20

increasing at remarkable percentage rates over the last

21

couple of years.

22

positioned to discuss that point given his job, which he's

23

required to assess how best to deal with that issue for his

24

state.

25

And I think he and -- he is perfectly

1

point -- and he doesn’t really say when that point is, but

at some point, a stay can lead to additional deaths if it

results in a meaningful delay of funds.

4

anyone could dispute that.

5

MR. GOLDMAN:

I don't see how

Your Honor, I do -- the point I'm

6

trying to make here is that Mr. Gar and the other

7

declarations are trying to draw a causal connection here

8

then because distributions will be delayed, that will result

9

in grievous harm.

MR. GOLDMAN:

No, it is not, and I would

acknowledge that it certainly does count.

into grievous harm based on not knowing what the amount is

15

end of 2024.

THE COURT:

Okay.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Just moving onto the declarations

4

that the UCC submitted, I think we -- from the two members

5

who have experienced firsthand the devastating effects of

6

the opioid epidemic, I think that, you know, it has to be

7

acknowledged that of all the people who have a right to

8

express an opinion on what will occur due to the opioid

9

epidemic if a stay is issued, is these two people.

10

However, that does not make certain parts of their

11

declarations admissible, which is really what we have the

12

objection to.

13

the solicitudes for the personal loss they've suffered and

admiration for what they have turned that into in terms of

Well, again, I mean, I think you're

objecting to one of the declarants saying that various forms

of treatment have stopped over the last year or the last

22

several months for want of funding.

23

an inference that, under the plan, similar occurrences

24

wouldn't -- would be prevented in the future, I think she --

25

again, I think that the witness can make a prediction of

She's much closer in my mind to the facts that she

is it depends on when the funds start flowing and what can

are doing.

But ultimately, I think it's the same point, which

16

There is going to be evidence that there is

declarations are submitted for that purpose, for determining

24

what the amount of a bond would be.

25

You

It may be calculable for

516-608-2400

Page 136
1

view as one that is adequately supported, that where you

2

have this number of deaths due to opioid overdoses occurring

3

on a daily basis, and you have insufficient funds as

4

acknowledged by all of the lawsuits, including by the State

5

of Washington and the State of Connecticut, that the more

6

money you have, the fewer people will die.

7

see how you can dispute that.

8

And maybe it's one person.

I mean, I don't

Maybe it's 100, but to

9

me that's incalculable, and it's -- it pretty -- I think it

10

does offset in terms of the balance of the harms, someone's

11

right to pursue their appellate rights to the Supreme Court

12

where the Supreme Court has denied certiorari on these

13

various issues multiple times in the last decade.

14

that applies primarily, if not entirely -- and I'll hear the

15

Debtors on this, of course, and the other parties, including

16

the UCC's counsel, to the request for an injunction through

17

the entire appellate process.

18

So again,

It may not apply in a meaningful way to an

19

injunction through a ruling by the District Court where it's

20

not clear to me that money would be flowing in any event

21

during that period as opposed to personal injury claims

22

being liquidated, as opposed to the 14 days when the

23

abatement procedures after the effective date are supposed

24

to be submitted, etc.

25

But I just -- I don't understand how in one breath

the State Attorneys General of Connecticut, Washington, and

3

how to pursue monetary claims against the released parties

4

are of critical importance without focusing on the

5

consequences of the delay caused by the -- that right.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, Your Honor, it's one of the

reasons why we did restrict and scale back the request

THE COURT:

Okay.

But I'm not going to --

Which is a -I'm not going to exclude anything in

I will just try to hit on some points that go

to the second part of my argument that haven't been said so

that's been identified is the critical importance of the

sentencing that it may have in creating a possibility of

11

and argued that there is a chance there, including from some

12

of the effects of the sentencing upon the Debtors, that may

13

produce the grounds for equitable mootness may create

14

irreparable harm.

15

And people have talked about already

But there's one other thing that people haven't

16

talked about yet, and that -- and I am not an expert, but I

17

have some experience with the difficulty of changing a

18

sentence once it's imposed.

19

statutory, and federal criminal procedures, doctrines and

20

issues that arise that may make it hard to undo a sentencing

21

once it's in place.

22

sources for the Debtor's clearly apparent position that, you

23

know, that they will not agree that this -- to any

24

stipulation against the equitable mootness of the effect of

And I think that that may be one of the

I think that that's a huge issue that happens

2

before the effective date that could be significant in its

3

effects.

4

I don't know the criminal doctrines.

5

And I don't pretend to know everything about it.

THE COURT:

Let's just move on.

Okay.

You raised

6

the point, but there's no reason talking about it further if

7

that's the extent of your knowledge.

8
9

MR. EDMUNDS:

So we should move on.

Well, I think -- I mean, I think,

you know, the basics of it, the due process clause, the

10

double jeopardy clause, Federal Rule 35, and certain

11

provisions of the U.S. Code do place limits on it.

12

that that's -- I mean, in part, it's hard to anticipate

13

where that will go in advance, and everybody has that same

14

difficulty.

15

others have talked about the immediate effect on Perdue and

16

its business.

17

I think

So I think that's an issue there, and I think

The -- our -- moving on, our motion raised other

18

issues of irreparable harm that are not related to -- and we

19

did not rely on the possibility of equitable mootness.

20

talked about in our original motion in September, the cost

21

to the estate of going forward with a plan that may be

22

altered or reversed on appeal.

23

to the trust advances issues, but it's also related to the

24

fact that if you look at the fee statements that are coming

in, a whole lot of money is being spent on attorneys' fees

expended from the estate in pursuit of implementing the

MR. EDMUNDS:

I will move on.

The

other irreparable harm that exists, though, is I think the

possibility of implementing the plan and changing

it's changed or if it's reversed.

I don't think it is, Your Honor.

think that there are things that the Court has ruled, and

11

Debtors have stipulated that don't constitute irreparable

12

harm that are happening -- or that don't constitute a ground

13

for equitable mootness that are happening right now that do

constitute a potential irreparable harm.

Is the State of Maryland not amenable

to.

15

The types

I think I'd have to -- we are

amenable to some form of agreement, but I think I would have

to look at the precise contours of that and make an

evaluation as to how serious it was.

19

today, I don't think I can agree to that without some sort

20

of detail about what it is.

So not as I sit here

21

You know, it -- there are risks and there are

22

harms inherent in anything that happens, and I think it

requires sort of a precise evaluation as to whether we would

agree to that.

be.

2

THE COURT:

Well, the general concept would be

3

that -- and I believe Mr. Gold laid this out -- that the

4

appellees would not argue equitable mootness based upon a

5

transfer of the Debtor's business as provided for under the

6

plan to NewCo and making the initial distribution under the

7

plan.

Either under the plan or in the form of a 363 motion.

8
9

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, I mean, I think that the

-- things that significant, there may be ways you could --

10

nuances that you can remove from it, but I think that things

11

that significant carry with them the possibility of

12

irreparable harm.

13

from the sheer fact that you might be unwinding, which

14

independent of equitable mootness will cause some amount of

15

loss.

16

would --

Both from the possibility of mootness and

You're now seeking a stay pending appeal, and yet

you're arguing that if you win, which is an "if", the cost

of unwinding itself is irreparable harm?

corporate structure that has parallel ownership.

20

It's not -- it's not like a typical subsidiary

21

relationship.

One -- is controlling multiple --

22

corporations.

In effect, the shareholder -- whether through

23

non-debtor entities that are U.S. entities or direct action

24

on boards -- are controlling those entities.

25

Canadian law, there's a basis for direct claim against those

212-267-6868

And under

516-608-2400

Page 148
1

parties.

2

Obviously the problem or the question or the

3

interpretation of the plan and whether or not the release as

4

granted occupies the territory fully -- that's the

5

structural problem -- the appeal is we believe meritorious.

6

And ultimately -- irreparable harm which is that ultimately

7

these Canadian creditors stand to lose the claims they may

8

have against U.S. non-debtor entities or U.S. released

9

shareholders -- confirmed plan.

10

It's a structural problem.

It's a structural

11

problem that the debtors and the Sacklers created when they

12

created their corporate structure.

13

wish I could change it.

14

THE COURT:

That's all it is.

I

Well, all I will note is I don’t think

15

you addressed this legal argument on the nature of the

16

Canadian creditors' claims anywhere in your motion.

17
18

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I actually believe that there is a

reference.

19

THE COURT:

Where is it?

20

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Within -- certainly within my

21

reply.

22

let me pull up the page that referenced this issue.

23

cited in the reply, Your Honor.

24

to in the actual motion.

25

I actually quote a portion of the brief.

I think -It's

And it's more than alluded

And to remind you, Your Honor, the motion was

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 149
1

actually filed in advance of the briefing before the

2

district court.

3

Paragraph 8.

So I believe if we look at, yeah, Page 4,

4

THE COURT:

Okay.

5

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I see it.

So there is a colorable basis for

6

a claim by my clients against non-debtor, third-party

7

released parties.

8

reply and I think in the moving papers, is the loss of that

9

financial claim or right.

10

And irreparable harm, as we cited in the

So that's a principal question that I think in the

11

first instance you're looking for which is what is the

12

irreparable injury in the absence of a stay.

13

obviously the concern.

And that is

14

I think in terms of the resolution of the matter,

15

I think Your Honor is very thoughtful on this question of a

16

longer stay versus a shorter stay, a stay through finality

17

versus a stay more or less governed by a Rule 8025.

18

certainly I think that the Canadian appellants take the

19

position that a stay 14 days -- through 14 days after the

20

rendering of the district court decision is more than

21

adequate at this time.

22

And

But I do think it is a thoughtful question by Your

23

Honor because honestly the circumstance where a trial court

24

would be looking at whether or not to stay its own decision

25

for longer than any determination that might be made by an

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 150
1

appellate court would be a circumstance where the trial

2

court recognized that there's some aspect, be it

3

constitutional or structural, in the plan that would be

4

jeopardized were it not stayed, meaning that there's

5

something about it that deserves finality.

6

leave that question to Your Honor's best judgment.

And I would

7

But I would also repeat that in terms of the stay,

8

the lesser of the two alternatives that Your Honor described

9

is certainly -- is certainly acceptable to the First

10

Nations, without waiving whatever Your Honor might decide

11

about a longer or a larger stay.

12

I think there's a fundamental interesting question

13

with regard to the sentencing and the plea agreement, and it

14

is a problem.

15

plea agreement many times.

16

financial settlement, and that's what we do in this court.

17

And ultimately I'm not aware of due process issues that

18

would bar a stay through the date of sentencing with regard

19

to the defendants.

20

And I think in terms of it, I've read the
I see it as little more than a

I think it makes a huge amount of sense because

21

whether or not the sentencing gives rise to equitable

22

mootness is going to impact what may happen subsequent to

23

the appellate process because obviously you've got your

24

superpriority claim that may come into effect if for any

25

reason the terms of the plan are modified such that -- you

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 151
1

know, such that the plea is -- the plan isn't funded.

2

that would be the concern.

So

3

So although certainly the Canadian First Nations

4

agree that the lesser of the two stays that Your Honor had

5

explained would be sufficient here, I would request that the

6

Court be mindful of the fact that the sentencing will have a

7

material impact on this case and, depending upon the results

8

of the appellate process, it may completely impact whether

9

or not the assets of the debtor can be liquidated and how,

10

if it came to that -- I don’t think anybody wants it to come

11

to that, but if it did, the fact that the sentencing had

12

gone forward might be a problem if it's not a basis for

13

equitable mootness.

14

So ultimately, Your Honor, I mean, I think that's,

15

you know, by in large the points that I wanted to make or

16

things that perhaps I wanted to highlight from our concern.

17

Ultimately I think the harm that we have here is an

18

interesting circumstance of -- so effectively the IACs are

19

non-debtor parties.

20

Those are the assets that in part, over time, will

21

fund the trust in the United States.

22

presently stayed from pursuing those assets.

23

that remains to be the case will be the subject I suppose --

24

and the determination before the CCAA court in Canada which

25

is pending for December 1.

212-267-6868

My clients are
Whether or not

And that's another example.

Page 152
1

I'm not sure if it's irreparable harm.

2

an instance of another intervening deadline with regard to

3

an international matter where it might be worth the

4

consideration of the Court of the fact that a stay here

5

would probably relieve that Canadian court of a difficult

6

decision.

7

would be my take on it.

8
9

And maybe I'm wrong.

I don’t know.

But it is

But that

So, but ultimately I think the debtor has
ultimately the benefit of these IAC assets.

These are

10

assets that ultimately my clients would be seeking to

11

recover from if they're permitted to do so by way of appeal

12

or before the CCAA court.

13

And I'm making this argument with reference to the

14

bond issue because, first of all, I'm not aware of the

15

debtor having an affirmative claim against the CMFN.

16

Frankly if they're sovereigns, there's a question of whether

17

or not there would be an applicable need for a pond under

18

that circumstance.

19

But ultimately what's interesting is that it's

20

arguable that the debtors in fact have a lien on Canadian

21

assets by virtue of the settlement such that I would say

22

whether or not Your Honor finds a need for posting of a bond

23

by any other appellate creditor here, ultimately because of

24

the fact that these Canadian assets are dedicated under the

25

existing plan and settlement and trust to the debtor, that I

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 153
1

think there's a strong argument that the debtor is protected

2

and there should be no need for an appellate bond with

3

regard to the Canadian creditors here.

4

say --

5
6

THE COURT:

I'm sorry.

That's all I have to

What Canadian assets are

you referring to?

7

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Purdue Canada.

At a bare minimum,

8

Purdue Canada because it's dedicated to -- you know, to sale

9

and contribution to the debtor.

I can't -- I can't speak,

10

and don’t want to speak directly to the extent to which

11

Purdue Canada has been securitized pursuant to those

12

settlement agreements.

13

THE COURT:

But it may have been.
But the bond would be to protect

14

against the damage, if any, caused by the delay or any other

15

factor that the stay would occasion.

16

something beyond what the debtors already have.

17

MR. UNDERWOOD:

Right.

So it would be

But that's presuming that

18

there is -- I think the argument would be that -- and I do

19

think there's some case law to this effect, that, in effect,

20

the debtors already have a form of a lien.

22

THE COURT:

But it's not a lien on your clients'

It's their own assets.

MR. UNDERWOOD:

no, but they already have it.

MR. BASS:

know --

13

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Well, on your first

14

point, the briefing schedule set by Judge McMahon on your

15

appeal of the confirmation order is not the subject of a --

16

it's not something that I can stay.

17

it's not really covered by the bankruptcy rules.

18

something you'll have to take up with her --

19

MR. BASS:

20

THE COURT:

That's

Right.
-- whether you get an extension or

21

not.

22

that I would be considering.

So that's not really an appropriate subject for a stay

23

MR. BASS:

24

THE COURT:

25

It's not my order, and

Okay.
And the same goes for your desire to

have the district court consider together your appeal of the

confirmation order and the other litigation that was the

2

subject of your motion that I heard back in mid-October.

3

MR. BASS:

4

THE COURT:

5

Right.
And I denied that motion in an order

entered on October 15th that's at Docket Number 3958.

6

MR. BASS:

7

THE COURT:

Right.
But again, if any of that litigation

8

is to be consolidated with your appeal, that's really up to

It's not -- it's not something that I could

rule on.

11

MR. BASS:

12

THE COURT:

Oh, all right.

Okay.

I think the only movant

13

that I haven't heard from is Ms. Isaacs, who adopted the

motion filed by the State of Washington, and of course we've

15

heard the State of Washington and the State of Connecticut

It's quarter to 2:00.

So I'll

hear briefly from the objectants and, again, I read the

through the ruling by the District Court of some or all of

Mr. DelConte, I had a

Do you have your declaration there?

17

MR. DELCONTE:

18

THE COURT:

I do.

Okay.

In your declaration, you

19

discuss the timing of payments under the plan and describe

20

them in Paragraphs 7 through 9 and 12 through 21, and also

21

payments to fund the NewCo under the plan in Paragraph 22.

22

And then in Paragraph 26, 27 and 28, you do that present

23

value calculation based on your assessment of the delay in

24

distributions that would result from a stay of three months

25

through 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months.

My question is, assume for the

moment a stay through the date of a ruling by the District

4

Court of the effective date of the plan, and then tack on 14

5

days to that.

6

say, in the third or fourth week of December.

I'm making a prediction on how the District Court might

9

earlier than that.

10

So assume that would be sometime, let's just

The court might rule later than that; might rule
When you say three months, what are you

tracking off of as the effective date?

11

MR. DELCONTE:

I'm tracking off of the end of the

12

year, which a good proxy for when, you know, I think the

13

earliest that we could potentially emerge would be.

14

three-month delay in this case would be delaying emergence

15

from December 31st to the end of March.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

17

MR. DELCONTE:

18

THE COURT:

So a

And --

2022.

I got it.

And the distributions that

19

would be -- that you track as coming in on the effective

20

date for that period, are any of those distributions to the

21

end-users of the money, or are those distributions to the

22

trust and to NewCo?

23

MR. DELCONTE:

Yeah, those distributions that

24

we're tracking, and these are the distributions to -- both

25

the Federal government and the creditors are in public

212-267-6868

trusts.

Those are just the timing of those payments --

2
3

THE COURT:

So there would be a distribution to

the Federal government --

4

MR. DELCONTE:

-- to those trusts, not -- we

5

haven't taken into account any -- yeah, I mean, there's the

6

$225 million payment to DOJ and there's a $25 million

7

payment to other Federal entities, in addition to the

8

trusts; $600-some-odd million would be distributed to the

9

creditor of the public trusts.

And we're tracking the

10

payments to those trusts.

11

into account payments from those trusts ultimately to the

12

end-users.

THE COURT:

We haven't done anything to take

All right.

Then is there some

amount that would also go to fund NewCo, or is that just

MR. DELCONTE:

17

currently sitting at OldCo or PPLP, and at emergence, $200

Your testimony is complete, Mr.

Okay.

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Okay, Your Honor.

Shall I

proceed?

10

THE COURT:

Yes.

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Okay.

Again, Benjamin

12

Kaminetzky, of Davis Polk, for the Debtors.

So, Your Honor,

13

I'm going to take your guidance, of course, and at first

14

I'll focus on what we'll call the short-term period between,

15

let's call it, now and the District Court's ruling.

16

And Your Honor, what we've done is we've provided

17

and have been willing to provide complete protection to the

18

movants against all risk of equitable mootness in the near

19

term, which would allow for Judge McMahon to decide the

20

pending appeals on the merits and would have eliminated the

21

need for today's hearing, but we're already here.

22

that we ask for is an escape hatch for the movants to

23

renotice the motion in a proper forum if there's any risk

24

that mootness were to arise in the future in a situation

25

that we quite frankly don't expect to happen.

212-267-6868

And all

516-608-2400

Page 164

And this is exactly what Your Honor suggested we

2

do, which was to try to "hit the sweet spot," based on a

3

reasonable prediction of when the District Court might rule.

4

So let's be crystal clear on where we are right now and what

5

it is that the movants have refused to accept.

6

The Debtors and the other plan proponents have now

7

made the following six unilateral concessions in writing,

8

signed, which provides everything the movants can get out of

9

this hearing.

Now, Your Honor noted that the movants need

10

to show harm, not just conjecture -- I wrote those words

11

down -- but we have eliminated even conjecture.

12

mean by that?

13

What do I

Every single party that intends to present

14

arguments or evidence to the District Court on appeal.

15

includes the Debtors, the UCC, the AHC, the MSGE, the NAS

16

group.

17

writing to you, to the District Court, that they will never

18

argue before any court that the appeals of the confirmation

19

orders have been rendered equitably moot by the actions

20

taken in advance of the effective date in furtherance of the

21

plan, pursuant to both the confirmation order and the

22

advance order.

23

That

Both sides of the Sackler Family have stipulated in

This agreement is set forth in stipulation and was

addition, Sir, the Debtors have the --

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. KAMINETZKY:

6

THE COURT:

In

Can I -Sorry.

Can I just stop you there?

So, on the

7

stipulation, the movants have said that you've carved out

8

arguing equitable mootness with respect to the sentencing

9

and its effects.

10
11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Yes.

And that's -- we test in

the next point, Your Honor.

12

THE COURT:

Okay.

13

MR. KAMINETZKY:

We have agreed that we will not

14

request that the criminal sentencing take place before

15

December 20th.

16

the sentencing hearing could otherwise occur as of December

17

1st.

18

it's clear.

Now, under the plan, as Your Honor knows,

But let's just pause for a second on that, just so

19

The plea and sentencing is pursuant to a separate

20

agreement with the DOJ, not the plan and confirmation.

21

There was some confusion about that, but that's not

22

something that's addressed under the plan.

23

we agreed to to the DOJ.

24

anything, we've also agreed that we'll file a notice on the

25

docket -- and obviously, it will be on the New Jersey

212-267-6868

That's something

But lest you think we're hiding

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 166
1

court's docket -- when the criminal sentencing hearing is

2

scheduled.

3

And lest you think we're hiding anything and not

4

being transparent, the sentencing hearing has not been

5

scheduled, and suffice it to say that scheduling a

6

sentencing hearing in a U.S. District Court can take several

7

weeks.

8

to schedule that sentencing hearing.

9

And we haven't asked -- we haven't reached out yet

So isn't something that could happen in the dead

10

of night without any notice.

11

in a very public case.

12

we've agreed already in writing that the earliest it

13

possibly could occur is December 20th.

14

-- we haven't even reached out to obtain a sentencing date.

15

And when I say we, I mean we and/or the DOJ.

There'll be plenty of notice.

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. KAMINETZKY:

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. KAMINETZKY:

20

THE COURT:

21

This is a sentencing hearing
And

But again, that date

Well --

Okay.

Okay.

So that's number --

Why don't --- four.

The --

Why don't you go through all the

points, and I'll come back to questions I have.

22

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Okay, good.

Number four, the

23

Debtors will provide no less than 14-days' notice of the

24

actual effective date.

25

asked us to do, and we obviously have agreed to do it.

212-267-6868

And that was something Judge McMahon

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I

516-608-2400

Page 167
1

already talked about that we'll file on the docket when the

2

criminal sentencing has been scheduled.

3

And finally, the plan opponents agree that the

4

movants may renew their stay motions or file a new motion as

5

of the earlier of the District Court's decision on appeal

6

and December 15th.

7

So these concessions provide the movants complete

8

protection from the risk of equitable mootness until

9

December 20th at the earliest and would either allow the

10

District Court to decide the appeals on the merits, or if

11

contrary to everyone's expectation, Judge McMahon's ruling

12

is delayed, tee up the stay motions at a later point in

13

time, before any risk of mootness becomes imminent.

14

We've built everything in so that the two things

15

that could possibly render -- you know, arguably render

16

anything equitably moot, we've built into the stipulation

17

that we've provided, protection that they could come back to

18

court and make any -- renew this motion.

19
20

So there's literally -- I mean, the only harm that
they could articulate --

21

THE COURT:

Well --

22

MR. KAMINETZKY:

-- in the short-term stay or in

23

the short-term period is the equitable mootness, and we have

24

taken it off the table.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

So could I explore that for a minute

or two?

2

MR. KAMINETZKY:

3

THE COURT:

Please.

I expect you heard me initially having

4

some doubt as to how the sentencing, when it occurs,

5

arguably give rise to equitable mootness.

6

one thing, and perhaps two.

7

sentencing occurs, there will be tremendous pressure to go

8

effective at that point, because the Debtors, as opposed to

9

NewCo, which only exists under the plan if the plan goes

And I was told

First I was told that if the

10

11

business.

What is your response to that?

12

MR. KAMINETZKY:

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. KAMINETZKY:

That might very well be the case.

Okay.
That the -- again, it's not

15

necessarily two seconds later, but there's certainly a risk

16

of that.

17

THE COURT:

18

MR. KAMINETZKY:

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. KAMINETZKY:

21

Well, how -And that is why we're not --

How soon afterwards does that happen?
Well, I'm not sure.

I don't

think it's necessarily up to us.

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

23

MR. KAMINETZKY:

I'm not the expert in this area.

24

But I'm not here to argue that the sentencing isn't a very

25

big deal.

212-267-6868

I'm here saying that there's no risk that that

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 169
1

could happen under the stipulation that we've provided, or

2

are willing to provide, or have provided to the other side

3

without giving them an opportunity to come back and get a

4

stay, if necessary.

5

Obviously, if we're in that position and Judge

6

McMahon hasn't ruled yet, we'll take that into account and

7

most likely extend that date.

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. KAMINETZKY:

10

THE COURT:

We're not --

Well --- here trying --

I'm sorry.

What is the harm to the

11

Debtors and the other Appellees of delaying the sentencing,

12

or having the Debtors request a sentencing hearing date that

13

would be, say, at the end of December?

put this -- what she called a "rocket docket."

she's going to try to rule very promptly.

December 30th.

13

And that's why

But, you know, those are all -- and that's why we

14

just want the back-up drop-dead date.

15

expect -- and the purpose of the stipulation is to give them

16

comfort that nothing will happen until Judge McMahon rules,

17

both the effective date and the sentencing.

18

THE COURT:

19

MR. KAMINETZKY:

20

But again, we all

So, can we -And once we've -- Your Honor,

this is -- I'm sorry.

21

THE COURT:

The proposal is, as you've repeated

22

just now, that the agreement is that the effective date

23

would not occur until the earlier of the District Court's

24

ruling or December 30, which places the onus on the movants

25

to seek a ruling within the 14-day notice period that you've

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 171

agreed to, assuming that a ruling isn't forthcoming by

2

December 30, right?

That's really what you --

3

MR. KAMINETZKY:

4

THE COURT:

5

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Right, that's --

That's what you're suggesting.
Yes, because -- and again, the

6

burden is on -- let's just -- I'm not asking for a favor,

7

Your Honor.

8

THE COURT:

Right.

9

MR. KAMINETZKY:

The burden is on them.

Like, a

10

stay isn't the natural state of being.

A stay is

11

extraordinary, and they have a burden.

Their only burden,

12

the only harm that they could talk about -- and again, we're

13

limiting this to the interim period as equitable mootness.

14

We have taken it off the table until, you know, Judge

15

McMahon rules, for all intents and purposes.

16

done, then.

17

We think we're

And again, if there's an issue or, the only thing

18

that we've added is a -- you know, let's say something

19

happens and Judge McMahon doesn't rule, yes, the burden

20

would be on them.

21

that to happen and they can't -- sitting here today, they

22

can't meet their burden.

23

But that's fair because we don't expect

First of all, equitable mootness alone shouldn't

24

count.

25

Your Honor loud and clear, that Your Honor wants meaningful

We've given them meaningful

And at that point in time, Your Honor -- and I

4

could go through the case law; Your Honor already did it --

5

basically, that's all you could give them at this hearing,

6

because under the vast majority of rule, with the exception

7

of a single case that the U.S. Trustee found, is that Your

8

Honor's kind of jurisdiction, or Your Honor's ability to

9

impose a stay, or Your Honor's stay dissolves after the

10

District Court rules.

So we're giving them, with one exception, until

Judge McMahon rules.

13

14

sideways and for some reason Judge McMahon hasn't ruled, we

15

could come back to you at that time.

THE COURT:

Are there other actions...?

Let's say

17

I just stayed the effective date and not the plan itself --

18

I mean, the confirmation order itself; I stayed one of the

19

conditions to the effective date, which would -- until the

20

District Court ruled or December 30, whatever was earlier --

21

are there steps that would involve either -- let me just

turn to the applicable section -- the transfer of material

important point.

which is the only risk or the only harm that they've

4

identified, they are not entitled even to the short-term

And we've done that.

6

And we've taken into account anything that they've

7

identified, including, obviously, the effective date and the

8

sentencing, by giving them comfort that we won't seek

9

sentencing before December 20th.

The U.S. Trustee is perfectly capable

MS. LEVINE:

In fact, it's already done so, and
So it wouldn't seem to

We certainly could go back to the

Court if we have to go back to the Court, Your Honor.

We

10

don't see the harm in entering the stay now, though, to

11

prevent that additional motion practice, which will cost

12

everyone resources, you know, particularly if the stay is

13

less than what we are asking for, but is just through the

14

date of the District Court decision.

MS. LEVINE:

THE COURT:

That's all you're going to get.
You know, that -You're not going to get any more than

giving up anything on this point.

MS. LEVINE:

MS. LEVINE:

I got that impression, Your Honor.
Okay.
So, you know, what we're talking

about balancing is, you know, that short amount of time,

that short amount of delay, to ensure that the District

THE COURT:

2

MS. LEVINE:

3

All right.

So let me just ask Mr. --

-- everybody agrees on this is

something that should happen.

4

THE COURT:

-- Mr. Kaminetzky.

Your concern is

5

really just if something happens that is unexpected, that

6

delays Judge McMahon from ruling, right?

7

really why you've put this earlier of District Court ruling

8

or December 30, right?

9

MR. KAMINETZKY:

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

12

THE COURT:

Exactly.

I mean, that's

We did --

So --- I mean, again --

I mean, if that happens -- I mean, I

13

don't what it would be.

14

what happens.

15

can't the Debtors come back to me and say it's a port for us

16

to have the effective date go forward now?

17
18

I don't know

But I think what Ms. Levine is saying is why

MR. KAMINETZKY:
that's not what the law is.

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. KAMINETZKY:

21

THE COURT:

22

Maybe, you know...

The answer is, Your Honor, just
The law --

Because it --- isn't that --

It would shift the burden.

You're

saying it would shift the burden.

23

MR. KAMINETZKY:

It shifts the burden.

Yeah, the

24

burden is on them to show -- and I'm now quoting from the

25

Calpine case, how it has to be neither remote nor

speculative, but actual and imminent.

THE COURT:

3

MR. KAMINETZKY:

There is no harm.

Okay.
The only harm they've articulated

4

is equitable mootness, and we've taken that off the table.

5

They are not entitled to a stay.

6

seven or eight times that we've eliminated any risk to them.

7

And if the unexpected happens, I'm fine with -- you know,

8

December 15th they could file their new motion.

9

until December -- the earliest sentencing date is December

We've written it in blood

We'll wait

10

11

one has to be seven days later.

13

isn't, because we've agreed to take that off the table.

14

THE COURT:

They have all the time in
But it

So when -- I'm just trying to figure

15

out how the 14-days' notice of the effective date would tie

16

into a December 30 sentencing date and a December 30 end

17

date to the voluntary stay.

18

notice?

19

When would you give that

I guess you'd get -- can I interrupt you?

I guess

20

what you would do -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is you would

21

fairly soon, I suppose, reach out to the District Court in

22

New Jersey and say, can you give us a sentencing hearing

23

sometime between December 30 and the next available date

24

thereafter.

25

then you would -- then you would --

MR. KAMINETZKY:

We're giving

Well, it's both, Your Honor.

We

10

would give them notice of the sentencing hearing when it's

scheduled.

So, you know -- and Your Honor knows how busy District

So is the sentencing hearing date,

though, the key date, because the puzzle really does

arguably change -- that's the missing piece of the puzzle as

far as mootness is concerned?

sentence date?

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, Matthew Gold.

Any other stay

Can you hear

me?

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

Yes.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 184
1

MR. GOLD:

Just a couple of brief observations,

2

Your Honor.

The first is it seems to me, given the

3

construct of the Debtors' (indiscernible) that there would

4

be no additional burden on the Debtor, and it would make

5

perfect sense for them to provide us with substantially

6

immediate notice a time when a request is made of the

7

District Court for sentencing to occur, rather than saying

8

send a date and -- I mean, if they're making a request to

9

the District Court, they should be able to tell everyone

10

that they have done so right then and there, or

11

substantially (sound drops) thereafter, regardless of when

12

that occurs.

13

The second thing is that I still find in the

14

Debtors' proposal a subtle rewriting of Rule 8025, which

15

Your Honor discussed earlier, which provides for a two-week

16

stay following the ruling of the District Court, rather than

17

--

18

THE COURT:

That still applies.

19

applies.

20

District Court ruling.

21

That still

This is just -- this just takes you up to the

MR. GOLD:

I understand.

I just...

It just

22

seems, to us, cleanest when not creating confusion to say

23

that whatever Your Honor grants would be coterminous with

24

the stay that comes from under Rule 8025, rather than having

25

to have anyone puzzle out what happens if one stay applies -

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 185
1

- ends earlier, and another stay does not.

2

THE COURT:

Well, to me, the way to do that is to

3

say it's...

4

stay here.

5

obviate the need for a stay.

6

know, you have the District Court ruling.

7

comes into play.

8
9

First of all, the Debtors are not proposing a
They're proposing a stipulation that would

MR. GOLD:

Okay.

And that at that point, you
And then 8025

Well, the Debtors' stipulation

did not contain anything that said that it was not -- it was

10

possible we were concerned in reading it that it might be

11

intended to be a derogation of whatever rights --

17

I understand that point.

18

clear from my ruling here.

19

MR. GOLD:

Okay.

But I think that that would be

And Your Honor, I mean, the only

20

other thing which I will suggest is it's hard for me to

21

believe that anyone wants to be deliberately setting a

22

deadline that runs to New Years Eve, or immediately, giving

23

a few days after that, if parties are going to be having to

24

run in for emergency applications would make a certain

25

amount of sense, given that the Debtors have conceded that a

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 186
1

few days here or there is not going to make a meaningful

2

difference in this context.

3
4

Other than that, I have nothing to add on this
point, Your Honor.

5

THE COURT:

6

MR. GOLDMAN:

7

additional point?

8

State of Connecticut.

9

Your Honor, may I just add one

Irv Goldman, Pullman & Comley, for the

THE COURT:

10

Okay.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Sure.
I think Your Honor hit directly on

11

the head that the important date here, especially if the

12

District Court has ruled by December 30, is the criminal

13

sentencing date.

14

for that to be held to December 30 or December 31, if it

15

does actually fall on that date, I think it does make it --

16

and this follows up on Mr. Gold's point -- somewhat of a

17

difficulty in trying to get an emergency stay motion over

18

the holiday season, running up to December 30th.

19

it does, for that reason, make (sound drops) sense to have

20

that pushed out so we're not running into the holidays.

21

Although they've agreed to postpone asking

- you would file it and get a date a couple weeks before

have a hearing, although I think it would probably be

2

MR. GOLDMAN:

3

THE COURT:

Yes.
Okay.

That's all I had, Your Honor.
All right.

Okay, so, look, I

4

think obviously there is a lot more that the objectors want

5

to get in the record for this hearing.

6

the Debtors' proposal, with some tweaking, really does make

7

a lot of sense in the interim, particularly given Mr.

8

DelConte's testimony that the money itself wouldn't be

9

flowing even to the trusts until the beginning of 2022, and

But I do think that

10

wouldn't thereafter, at least for a while, be going out --

11

at least for a couple of weeks -- be going out to third

12

parties in the form of the abatement payments.

13

a little bit longer for the personal injury claimants, which

14

is the offsetting harm that the objectors have highlighted,

15

and rightfully so.

16

And probably

So, why don't I throw out -- and people can be

17

thinking about this while I hear the rest of the argument --

18

that the Court's ruling would be to deny the stay request,

19

on the conditions that the effective date not occur until

20

the earlier of the issuance of the District Court's ruling

21

and January 7th.

22

sentencing hearing to occur any earlier than January 7th,

23

and that they will provide notice, not only of when that

24

hearing is scheduled, but also their request for one to the

25

Appellants.

2

would also be accompanied by the stipulation that's been

3

signed that the Appellees will not argue that any of the

4

other actions that would be taken leading up to either the

5

District Court ruling or January 7 would serve as a basis

6

for equitable mootness.

7

And of course, that

So you all can mull that over, but I don't know if

8

you want to go into additional argument, Mr. Kaminetzky, or

9

does that conclude your argument?

10

from the other objectants.

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

In which case, I'll hear

I think you're on mute still.
I am on mute.

I have a double

12

mute because I don't trust just one mute.

13

well, Your Honor, we have -- if Your Honor wants me to

14

address the longer stay, if that's still on the table, then

15

I have a lot to say about that in terms of irreparable harm

16

and the other prongs.

17

hopefully, never.

18

But here's --

If not, then I'll save that for,

But it's really up to you.

We do have a -- you know, we have a lot to say on

19

the three-hour argument that the other side had on

20

irreparable harm and the balances of harms and public policy

21

and bond and all of that.

22

do something that you're not -- you don't want us to do, but

23

we're happy to make that record or not make that record.

MR. JORGENSEN:

THE COURT:

MR. JORGENSEN:

One thing, Your Honor, an update.

Okay.
In Paragraph 12 on Page 5-6 of my

Arkansas for 2020.

17

THE COURT:

Right.

18

MR. JORGENSEN:

And since I wrote and signed the

547 overdose deaths in Arkansas in 2020.

THE COURT:

22

MR. JORGENSEN:

I can source that for you if you

MR. JORGENSEN:

Okay.

So I found that number on

2

the Arkansas Drug Director's website, which is

3

artakeback.org.

4

when you go into that, it's the most recent post on the

5

7

the number 547 drug overdose deaths in Arkansas in 2020.

There's a news button you can push.

And

8

arrived at a final number, and I reached out to Kirk Lane,

10

who is the Arkansas Drug Director, and I asked him to source

THE COURT:

It's just the more accurate

Okay, thank you.

Does anyone want to

cross-examine Mr. Jorgensen on his declaration?

3

I will admit Mr. Jorgensen's declaration, subject

4

to admitting Mr. Lane's declaration, and the limitations

6

that would derive from third parties as being only Mr.

But I will note that his task here, I believe,
qualifies him to make such predictions and analyses, given

10

his role on behalf of the AAC; that is the Association of

So you can sign off Mr. Jorgensen.

Having seen Mr. Lane's declaration,

THE COURT:

So I will admit Mr. Lane's declaration

for that purpose.

14

Okay.

I think those are all the witnesses, so I'm

15

happy to go back now for brief oral argument by the

16

objectants, although again, I've reviewed the pleadings.

17
18

MR. LIESEMER:

Your Honor, I'll just be very brief

and turn it over then to the other plan proponent objectors.

19

Let me just say two things: one is with respect

20

to, you know, your tentative rulings or what have you.

21

That's all fine, except for -- I'm just a civil litigator

22

that plays in Bankruptcy Court from time to time.

23

I am told that Your Honor's suggestion or

24

requirement that we provide notice of even a request for

25

sentencing, that is something that perhaps we should not

516-608-2400

Page 200
1

agree to, given that this is an agreement between the U.S.

2

Attorney's Office and the Debtors, and we're not sure how

3

the U.S. Attorney's Office would feel about that; number

4

one.

5

Number two.

If we're talking about just a request

6

for sentencing and not the sentencing date itself, we'll be

7

getting in front of the U.S. District Court.

8

we're calling up the clerk of the court and asking for a

9

sentencing date and that somehow triggers a requirement to

10

tell the world that we've done so, that seems like kind of

11

stepping on the toes of the New Jersey District Court.

12

I mean, if

21

to do whatever they feel they need to do to protect their

rights.

23

THE COURT:

24

MR. LIESEMER:

25

Okay.
And then on the balance of harms,

we'll rely on Mr. DelConte's declaration and the extensive

be -- sorry -- emergence be delayed for any significant

group to make the principal argument with respect to the

balance of harm, the public interest, as well as the bond

Let's start with

No delay is tolerable.

The attorney general from the State of Missouri

8

recently stated that the number of opioid overdose deaths is

9

like a plane going down every day, a month, a year.

As Miss

10

Juaire and Miss Trainor explained in their declarations,

11

they see the devastation every day.

Now why do I mention him?

It turns out he was a

If the U.S. Trustee and the attorney generals get

their wish and we're stayed for even six months, and

3

assuming that that's all it is, there will be 36,000 more

4

deaths; that's 1 percent of the population of the State of

5

Connecticut.

6

As Mr. Guard said in his declaration, it's

7

unconscionable that the remote chance that some (sound

8

glitch) creditor could recover some money from the Sacklers

9

on some distant day or that some known creditors could

10

receive additional money after years of litigation could

11

justify the additional death of a single American; Paragraph

12

14 of his declaration.

13

The second argument that the movants make is that

14

the case has already been delayed for two years by the UCC,

15

among others, and therefore, incremental delay should be on

16

us and shouldn't be a big deal.

17

arguments even merit a response, but I just want to point

18

out a few things.

2

others, was one of the biggest opponents to the ERF.

3

Second, I won't go through everything that's

4

happened over the course of the last two years.

5

clear, there was six months of mediation, of which three

6

months was just public and public negotiations and three

7

months of public and private negotiations, six months of

8

mediation with the Sacklers, another three or four months to

The movants' third rationale, and admittedly only

is that not one dollar of the 26 billion goes to private

4

side claimants.

5

That's not an accident.

But why am I raising that here?

Washington and

6

Connecticut makes such a big deal about the NOS in their

7

papers, and they say that the money is coming in, but they

8

don't say that 1.4 billion of the Purdue money goes to

9

claimants who are getting zero from the National Opioid

10

Settlement.

11

It's something they don't want to admit.

Moreover, it's just innate to say that an (sound

12

glitch) claimant because they're getting money from the NOS

13

and tolerate some delay in getting the Purdue money.

14

cost of the opioid crisis is $78 billion a year.

15

The

As Your Honor said on August 23rd and during the

16

confirmation hearing, it just seems really boneheaded to say

17

this 4.25 billion won't pay off from all the opioid (sound

18

glitch), you shouldn't take it.

19
20

With that, Your Honor, I'll turn to the public
interest program.

21

The U.S. Trustee states that the co-op with the

22

U.S. Trustee and the public interest are, "one in the same"

23

because the government's interest is the public interest.

24

The U.S. Trustee further states that when the government is

25

the movant, the public interest and irreparable injury fact

proposition.

3

Let me respond in four ways.

First, not one case

that the U.S. Trustee cite stands for the proposition that

when the U.S. Trustee is the movant that the federal

6

government's interest is the one being implicated for

7

confirmation over (sound glitch).

8
9

Knowing this, in its appellate papers, the U.S.
Trustee has started referring to itself as the government,

10

as opposed to the Office of the United States Trustee.

11

We're not disputing that the U.S. Trustee's website says

12

that it's a component arm of the DOJ.

13

Trustee has not cited any cases where the U.S. -- because

14

the U.S. Trustee is never a creditor.

interest being equated with the public for the purpose of

this analysis.

But perhaps the U.S.

And therefore, it's

In other words, no one with the (sound glitch) to

19

say that such an extraordinary remedy that should only be

20

granted in the most narrow of circumstances.

21

should be wary of holding up the will of actual creditors

22

for the desires of a non-creditor.

Perhaps courts

23

Second, under the facts and circumstances of this

case in particular, it's inexplicable that the U.S. Trustee

is taking the position that its interest are those of the

So the case where every governmental entity that

16

is a creditor has already settled with Purdue and the

17

Sacklers and the other plaintiffs is either getting money on

18

the effective date or has already received such money.

what it perceives to be others' interest, to take the

Indeed, I think it's fair to say that there's

never been a case where the public interest is so

overwhelmingly opposed to the (sound drops).

22
23

Your Honor, with that, I'd like to address the
proposal that you made about 15 minutes ago.

24

THE COURT:

Okay.

25

MR. PREIS:

If I understood your proposal earlier,

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 215
1

Your Honor said that it'll be -- a condition to the

2

effective date is that it will be the earlier of January 7th

3

and the District Court ruling; is that correct?

4

that right?

5

THE COURT:

Do I have

Well, first, I have not -- this

6

proposal does not contemplate the entry of a stay.

7

contemplates is the denial of the stay motions without

8

prejudice to the future right to bring them on the

9

conditions of the denial and that it lays out the

10

What it

conditions.

11

And the first condition is, in fact, that the

12

appellees would agree that the effective date would not

13

occur until the District Court's ruling and January 7.

14

MR. PREIS:

So if I understand that correctly and

15

if the Debtors are not permitted to seek a sentencing

16

hearing earlier than January 7th, which was I believe

17

another condition, then it's possible if, as we all heard

18

Judge McMahon say that she -- you know, she has a trial

19

coming up on December 7th, and we kind of read between the

20

lines that Her Honor may rule before that.

21

Then between, let's call it December 7th and

22

January 7th -- now actually, it's really January 14th

23

because we can't go into (sound glitch) until seven days

24

after the criminal sentencing, you would be delaying (sound

25

glitch), but because by those terms.

212-267-6868

Is that correct?

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I

516-608-2400

Page 216
1

want to understand if that's what you meant.

2

THE COURT:

Well, yes, correct.

And that's

3

primarily to give the movants the opportunity to renew their

4

motion.

5
6

MR. PREIS:

Again, (sound glitch) that will be 37

days -- I'm sorry -- 30 days, 37 because (crosstalk).

7

THE COURT:

Well, except that under Rule 8025,

8

unless Judge McMahon shortened it, there would be 14 days

9

added on to the December 7th date, so you'd be at December

10

21.

11

MR. PREIS:

Right.

Which is I think why in the

12

original proposal, we get offered December 20th, which I

13

understand was not December 21.

14

this is because part of our argument, the irreparable harm

15

(sound glitch).

16

being December 20th to December 30th is okay.

17

know, there was some discussion about the holidays, so let's

18

move it to January 7.

The only reason I'm raising

And I know Mr. Kaminetzky said, you know,
And then, you

19

In effect, we've now elongated almost more than

20

half a month before -- if it turns out that Judge McMahon

21

actually rules by December 7 and we're able to get a

22

sentencing hearing by December 20th, we will move their

23

effective date by 17 or 18 days at the very least.

24

again, from our perspective, every day matters.

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

And

Well, except -- let me address that

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 217
1

because, again, I fully accept that there is almost

2

immeasurable harm in not getting the plan distributions to

3

PI claimants and to the state and governmental entities for

4

the purpose of abatement, and the other entities, the Indian

5

tribes and the hospitals and the like.

6

But based on my understanding of the plan and Mr.

7

DelConte's testimony, the money wouldn't actually go to them

8

until sometime after the effective date and probably weeks

9

after the effective date.

10

So I think that the real issue where the balancing

11

of the harms comes into play or the real time comes into

12

play is where the movants would seek a stay after the

13

District Court's ruling, pending appeal to the Second

14

Circuit.

15

MR. PREIS:

I don't dispute your reading of Mr.

16

DelConte's declaration.

17

just move the same period back (sound glitch).

18

THE COURT:

But isn't what all you've done is

I did.

I moved it a week from the end

19

of the year to January 7th, and that's basically because --

20

or arguably two weeks from December 21 to January 7, and

21

that's basically because I have some concerns about imposing

22

a hearing date on Judge McMahon around New Year's Eve or

23

around the Christmas holiday, so that's the only reason.

24

And it didn't seem to me, given the testimony,

25

that the delivery of the distributions beyond the trusts

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 218
1

would happen any slower because of that.

2
3

MR. PREIS:

I'm sorry, that wasn't my point.

I'm

sorry.

4

What I was trying to say is if all you've done is

5

move the initial distribution date back from December 21 to

6

January 14th or whatever it is, then that same period,

7

between the time the money first goes to the trust and the

8

money goes out, that same increment just gets added whenever

9

the money first goes out (sound glitch).

10

So that delay, that lag from the time the money

11

goes to the trust to the time it actually goes out, that

12

occurs no matter when the money (sound glitch) mid-January,

13

then you have a delay of (sound drops).

14
15

So the fact that there's -- you understand what
I'm saying or am I not making myself clear?

16

THE COURT:

No, I do.

I understand.

For example,

17

the 14 days for the states to deliver their final NOAT

18

allocation would start running from the effective date,

19

which would be those 14 days later.

20

MR. PREIS:

I do see that.

Yes, that was my point.

And that's

21

why when I said every day mattered, so it is actually by

22

moving everything back 17 days, it has a real effect.

23

anyways, that was my first point.

24

My second point is --

25

THE COURT:

212-267-6868

So

Well, could I interrupt you for a

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 219

second?

2

help to change it to the distribution date, as opposed to

3

the effective date because the effective date is also the

4

date when you transfer it to the trusts and set up NewCo,

5

the benefit company.

6

I guess for mootness purposes, it doesn't really

So I'm thinking out loud, but I think you may have

7

offered a solution of just making it the distribution date,

8

but I don't think that works for mootness purposes.

9

MR. PREIS:

Yeah.

10

THE COURT:

Okay.

11

MR. PREIS:

The second point, and I know Mr.

12

Kaminetzky raised this, this idea of having to give public

13

notice of when the Debtors even request the notice.

14

THE COURT:

No, I understand.

I understand that

15

point.

I don't think that really helps very much in any

16

event.

I mean, the key thing is when the District Court

17

schedules it.

18

MR. PREIS:

Correct, yes.

19

THE COURT:

Right.

20

MR. PREIS:

Okay, that was it.

21

Your Honor.

That's all I had.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. FOGELMAN:

Okay, that was it,

Thank you.

Okay.
Your Honor, may I briefly respond

24

to Mr. Preis's, frankly, outrageous accusations against the

THE COURT:

I think you have a right to do that,

Mr. Fogelman.

3

MR. FOGELMAN:

Your Honor, I just want to say

4

about everything Mr. Preis said was a mischaracterization or

5

just absolutely blatantly untrue.

6

all entirely irrelevant as to whether a stay should be

That time, Your Honor, is

And, you know, I'm happy to go into everything one

Again, I don't think any

of this is even relevant, but just to give one brief

11

example.

12

the Court at Mr. Preis's urging, when the government first

13

was in settlement negotiations with the Sacklers and Mr.

14

Preis raised the issue about providing those funds toward

15

abatement.

abatement fund, you know, the largest recipients of civil

21

recoveries are federal health care agencies that provide

22

billions of dollars towards opioid use disorder treatment.

23

And that, in any

So for Mr. Arik to stand up there and make the

24

statements he made is absolutely outrageous, Your Honor, and

25

completely irrelevant.

Veritext Legal Solutions

I'm not going to -- sorry.

2

THE COURT:

Anyway, I think it is largely

3

irrelevant.

4

about the role of the federal government in the case and in

5

history of prior settlement really goes to what the U.S.

6

Trustee's public interest argument is.

7

The only way it is relevant or the remarks

And in that sense, I think the U.S. Trustee has

8

been clear, in front of me at least, that it's not focusing

9

on anything other than its party in interest right as a

10

watchdog over the bankruptcy system, not on the other

11

interests of the federal government.

12

And on that point, Mr. Preis is basically just

13

saying that, you know, the watchdog is, in his view, barking

14

at the wrong person.

15

at this point.

But I think we should just cut it off

16

MR. FOGELMAN:

2

stay and short-term stay, and I'll try not to repeat the

3

arguments that have been made today.

4

And I'll address a long-term

It's important to remember that the committee

5

represents dozens of governmental agencies and entities.

6

And despite the handful of state objections and the U.S.

7

Trustee's objection, far more government entities support

8

the plan and oppose a stay than seek a stay; it's really far

9

more.

10

And there's a super-majority of states who support

11

the plan and 97 percent of the non-federal domestic

12

governmental entities who voted on the plan voted in favor

13

and there's a good reason for that and Your Honor has

14

recognized that in the confirmation decision.

15

the money is allowed to be spent on abatement, the better

16

the citizens of those states and those supporting states and

17

local governments will be.

18

The sooner

And despite suggestions to the contrary, the

19

dissenting states, their citizens will benefit as well.

20

They'll get their fair share of the monetary recovery, and

21

they'll get non-monetary benefits as well.

22

So let me now turn to irreparable harm, balance of

23

hardships, and public interest.

That's a serious amount of money.

In terms of a short-term stay, I make three

points.

11

made already, including with respect to equitable mootness -

12

- that's clearly off the table -- the mechanics of the

13

sentencing, and also the suggestion that somehow the Court

14

can cherry pick the settlement here and have it rejigger.

15

This was a settlement that was really a herculean task to

16

achieve, and it was carefully constructed and can't easily

17

be pulled apart.

18

Most of the points on the short-term stay have been

The three points I want to make on the short-term

19

stay are as follows.

20

burden is squarely on the movants, and they have not

21

satisfied their burden.

22

First, burden matters, and here the

Second, a stay, even a short-term stay, creates a

23

cloud and to give one -- and an unnecessary cloud.

24

to give one example, the committee has been interviewing

25

potential board members for the MDT, the NOAT, and for

And I think it's not a stretch to say that the more

2

there's a delay in the effective date of the plan, the more

3

the candidates -- some of them are very prominent people --

4

may be reluctant to sign on.

5

And then the final point I want to make with

6

respect to the short-term stay is that the Court has to

7

exercise its equitable powers sparingly.

8

cases, just give you a couple, United States against Veres,

9

1989 U.S. District Lexis 7069 at *17, "A court should

13

And the same

And in light of the safeguards that have been

14

offered here, it would be an improper exercise of the

15

Court's equitable powers to grant a stay.

16

The last point I want to make, and I hope this

17

isn't a point that Your Honor has to address, is the bond.

18

I don't think Your Honor needs to get into the issue of

19

whether the U.S. Trustee needs to post a bond because the

20

states do.

21

advisory committee language and other opponents of the stay

22

have cited the cases, that made clear that the states can't

23

piggyback on any rules that might apply to the U.S. Trustee.

24

That's all I have, Your Honor, unless you have any

25

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, I guess -- look, what

2

I've been considering is not a stay, but an order denying

3

the motion on conditions, so that would obviate the need to

4

deal with a bond.

5

side of the issue would prefer a stay with a bond to that,

6

right?

And, you know, I don't think that your

MR. WAGNER:

10

THE COURT:

Certainly not.
Okay, all right.

Thank you.

Thank you.
I'm also assuming, because I would

11

also, if I were to grant a stay, condition it on the ongoing

12

commitment as the appellants have already committed, to

13

pursue all appellant relief on an expedited basis.

14

assuming they will continue to do that based on their

15

statements and their understand of the importance of

16

resolving these issues promptly.

MR. LIESEMER:

Your Honor, may I be heard very

briefly?

THE COURT:

MR. LIESEMER:

21

But I'm

Sure.
Jeffrey Liesemer on behalf of the

MSGE Group.

22

Your Honor, when Judge McMahon ruled on the United

23

States Trustee's emergency motion for a stay before she

24

denied it without prejudice and she did so on the condition

25

that the appellees, which included the MSGE Group, enter

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 226
1

into a stipulation saying that all of the preparatory

2

actions under the advance order are not a basis for invoking

3

equitable mootness.

4

day advance notice requirement on any effective date, and

5

she also said that the appeals would proceed on a rocket

6

docket.

7

She ordered the Debtors to impose a 14-

And on that basis with those guardrails in place,

8

Judge McMahon said that the U.S. Trustee's speculation about

9

the possibility of equitable mootness did not rise to the

10

level of irreparable harm, and I would submit that it's the

11

same today.

12

The movants haven't identified anything that changes the

13

situation from the time that Judge McMahon has ruled.

14

There really hasn't been any material change.

And in addition to that, we have the Debtor, who

15

has offered up even additional guardrails, and Your Honor is

16

now contemplating guardrails as well insofar as denying the

17

stay motions with conditions.

18

So no showing with respect to irreparable harm and

19

specifically equitable mootness has been made, and I think

20

the motions can be safety denied on that basis, subject to

21

the guardrails, which Judge McMahon found to be sufficient

22

as is.

23

With respect to a longer-term stay, we share Your

24

Honor's concerns that that would clash with Rule 8025 and

25

essentially read Rule 8025 out of the bankruptcy rules.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

And

516-608-2400

Page 227
1

so, therefore, if there were a stay in place if they did

2

make their showing, then it would have to be limited up

3

through the District Court's ruling.

4

And with respect to the other elements, with

5

respect to balance of harms and the public interest and the

6

bond in the event that there would be an unlimited stay to

7

allow the appellate avenues to be exhausted, we simply stand

8

on our papers and on Colin Jorgensen's declaration.

9

Your Honor understands the point as time

10

progresses, the financial and human toll increases, and that

11

puts a big weight against any stay.

12

public interest, there is public interest in settlements and

13

the finality of reorganizations and, above all, finding one

14

way to resolve this public health crisis.

15

And with respect to

So we join the other opponents in opposing any

16

stay pending appeal.

17

THE COURT:

Thank you.

18

MR. SHORE:

Your Honor, Chris Shore from White &

19

Case on behalf of the ad hoc group of individual victims.

20

I want to -- and I've been feverishly kind of

21

working on my notes to address what I think is the issue

22

here, both respect the long-term stay, short-term stay, and

23

the idea of a denial of motions with conditions.

24
25

Let me start here.

Look, we tried to address the

issue outside of Court with respect to essentially a denial

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 228
1

of the stay without conditions.

2

now we have two pending motions with two separate requests:

3

one is a pending motion for a stay through the District

4

Court decision plus 14 days, and another is a request from

5

the U.S. Trustee for a stay through all appeals.

6

The appellants refused, so

I think you need to deny both of those on the

7

merits with findings and conclusion.

8

I just do this simply if we prevail at the District Court on

9

the appeal, and we think we will -- we wouldn't be here

10

fighting this and have fought for the plan if we didn't

11

think we will -- there is going to be another hearing.

12

Whether that is in the end of December or the beginning of

13

January, someone's bringing a motion in front of Judge

14

McMahon for the big stay, the one that nobody can control,

15

which is the time between when the Second Circuit appeal

16

gets docketed and when the Second Circuit rules.

17

And you ask, why can't

So there is a fact of a hearing coming up.

And as

18

one of the very creditor constituencies who isn't either

19

funded by taxpayers or by the estate, we simply can't have

20

10-hour hearings all the time on these subjects without

21

getting work-product which can be used in subsequent

22

hearings.

23

So my request is that we actually make use of the

24

evidentiary record that's here, not just throw this to Judge

25

McMahon to deal with with her busy docket and to have a

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 229
1

whole other hearing, evidentiary hearing, which she may not

2

even have the time for given the announcement of what her

3

schedule is.

4

So let me turn to the merits on why you should

5

deny the stay and what the specific findings I'm talking

6

about.

7

success because no one touched on this.

8

The order that was presented to you reflected what the

9

Debtors conceded, not what anybody else did.

Let me just address very briefly the likelihood of
I'll only say this:

We all became

10

appellants after that hearing, or at least we became

11

appellants after that hearing over the objection of the U.S.

12

Trustee and we all joined the argument.

13

technical argument that you can get rid of.

14

So that's a

I want to focus on only one event:

The day that

15

the Debtors are ready to consummate their plan but can't

16

because of some existing stay or the existence of some

17

conditions and how we protect the individuals, just the

18

individuals, from the harms accrue from that day forward.

19

think those harms accrue whether the stay is short or

20

whether the stay is long, and I want to address an issue

21

that Mr. Preis raised on that (sound glitch).

22

Let me start here.

I

You know that at the beginning

23

of the hearing that (sound glitch) rules are set up so that

24

(sound glitch) did this.

25

the Bankruptcy Court is likely to agree or disagree that its

212-267-6868

It's not, I don't think, because

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 230
1

own findings are subject to appeal or not, but rather

2

because the Bankruptcy Court is in the best position,

3

understanding who the parties are, what they're looking for,

4

what they're promising, and what the harms are in the event

5

there is or is not a stay.

6

So even if Judge McMahon were to rule before an

7

available exit and contemplate a further stay, this Court's

8

view of what (sound glitch) stay, that is a stay that would

9

exist through a Second Circuit ruling or a cert denial may

10

prove critical to her own analysis, which is likely have to

11

be conducted on a short notice brief period if and when that

12

(sound drops).

13

As to the harm calculus here, as we pointed out in

14

our objection, it's not a one-size-fit-all analysis.

15

applicant must make its own case based upon its own harmed

16

21

part of the public interest prong, is that there's a

22

societal harm of the erosion of constitutional rights of

23

individuals who allegedly have direct claims against the

24

Sacklers, which are being released for no compensation.

25

First, they allege no harms to themselves.

Two, the U.S. Trustee's claim, I think as

I'm not going to repeat arguments I made at the

212-267-6868

last hearing regarding this no compensation argument.

2

just say that the intention is both counterfactual in light

3

of the TEPs and inflammatory.

4

centers on the harm to these hypothetical individual Sackler

5

claimants.

6

But their whole analysis

Now, as we pointed out in our objection, we

7

represent probably the bulk of individuals who would

8

otherwise have the right to bring claims against the

9

Sacklers in light of the fact that 35,000 of our group

10

I'll

didn't vote on the plan and several hundred voted no.

11

But I think the U.S. Trustee misses the mark when

12

they attack our group for what seems to be a criticism that

13

we do not speak for every victim.

14

to speak for every victim.

15

for our group, and we have spoken, sometimes in a loud

16

voice, on behalf of those who've authorized us.

17

We have never purported

We've only purported to speak

In contrast, not one victim has authorized or come

18

forward in support of the U.S. Trustee's motion for a stay.

19

And the important part here is not the authorization piece;

20

it's the lack of identification of the individuals who may

21

be harmed and a quantification of that harm.

22

At the last hearing, Your Honor spoke directly to

23

the U.S. Trustee about trauma and what you viewed as the

24

narrow window that it provides for direct claims against

25

non-debtor fiduciaries and shareholders.

2

recovered from the TADPs that will be funded by the

4

That's what their harm is.
Balanced against that and what the remainder of my

analysis focuses on and the real harms of real individuals

do that because there is a pending order of court, whether

written as a stay or a denial of a stay with conditions.

And let me pause here because people are just

getting it wrong with respect to the harms.

The Court's also in a unique position to

understand what basis what a big case like this puts forward

uncertain period.

8

this case, the Dow had its second biggest percentage drop

First, plans face market risks.

in which half the creditor body are elected officials.

their political landscape changes is not certain.

6

The

And as Your Honor noted during the confirmation

7

hearing, this settlement is around a shifting landscape of

8

judicial precedent that exists, all of which at any given

9

time will empower somebody who cut the deal to say they got

a bad deal and somebody else to say they got a good deal.

11

Obviously, the risks increase over time.

But

12

nobody is promising anything if they are wrong in the law

So how does this play out?

Again, I think the

U.S. Trustee, given their role, statutory role, and the

20

absence of any direct harm to them and the fact that they're

21

purporting to speak on behalf of individuals and have yet to

22

articulate who they're speaking for, what their claims are,

23

and what they're worth should have their application denied

24

on the merits with prejudice right now with specific

25

findings about their lack of proof, with one caveat.

They've taken the position that they have zero

2

responsibility to post the bond.

I don't need to get into

3

that argument at this late date.

They have zero economic

4

responsibility if they're right.

5

So deny their motion.

But they can be clear,

6

nothing prevents the U.S. Trustee from piggybacking off a

7

stay that is awarded to some other party, and nothing

8

prevents the U.S. Trustee from volunteering to post a bond

9

to protect for a month.

10

So what does a bond look like with respect to the

11

other applicants?

12

think a denial of the stay with conditions isn't necessary.

13

But we have no objection to this Court giving Judge McMahon

14

I don't think any stay is necessary.

MR. ISRAEL:

May I be heard very

Sure.
Thank you, Your Honor.

The NAS

Committee, another entity that is not funded by the

6

taxpayers, represents the most innocent victims of the

7

opioid crisis, the NAS children, will focus its argument

8

exclusively on the irreparable harm and the public interest

in light of Mr. Shore and Mr. Preis’ arguments which they

10

adopt.

11

The appellants in this case have made clear that

they will go to the ends of the earth to prevent the plan

13

from becoming effective.

20

delay of billions of dollars of abatement funds that would

21

otherwise be used to combat the opioid crisis and a delay in

making vital documents available to the public through the

For what reason?

There will also be a

Page 244
1

there will be any corresponding benefit to the personal

2

injury victims, including the NAS children, of the opioid

3

crisis.

4

To be clear, the NAS Committee had hoped for a far

5

larger settlement.

However, the plan, including the

6

settlement and the third-party releases and the

7

corresponding public interest must be viewed in reality.

8

The NAS class voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan, and

9

Kara Trainor, a parent of an NAS child, outlined in great

10

detail in her declaration why she supports the plan,

11

notwithstanding her personal situation.

12

ignore this massive support of both the voters and Ms.

13

Trainor in their pleadings.

14

The appellants

Simply put, a stay of the confirmation order

15

delays implementation of what could be lifesaving programs

16

for opioid victims, current and future, and compensation for

17

some of the neediest people in the country.

18

perhaps the U.S. Government can get an additional $2 billion

19

at the expense of all other claimants, a result worse than

20

the tobacco litigation?

21

can make life miserable for the Sacklers by litigating

22

against them for the foreseeable future, resulting in no

compensation to the NAS children and the other opioid use

dollars that would otherwise go for abatement?

I have

I have before me

three motions for a stay pending appeal, a first day motion

11

by the United States Trustee for a stay pending appeal of

12

two orders, the Court’s order confirming the Twelfth Amended

13

Chapter 11 Plan in these cases, and secondly, the Court’s

14

so-called Advance Order permitting the Debtors to take

15

certain procedural steps and spend a relatively modest

16

amount of money to be more ready to effectuate the

17

transaction under the plan if and when the effective date

18

occurs.

19

The other two motions are first by the states of

20

Washington and Connecticut, and second by the State of

21

Maryland, which seek a stay pending appeal over the

22

confirmation order.

23

Three other appellants have joined in one or the

24

other of those motions, and in respect of one of them have

25

supplemented the joinder to some extent.

4

I have tried to narrow those so that it does

5

reflect in the plan that such claims are only those where

6

there is a substantial or an entire overlap.

7

that the factual record of the claims that the U.S. Trustee

8

purports to be protecting reflects just that overlap, i.e. a

control over an enterprise that itself engaged in fraud or

other violations of consumer law which would apply to all

creditors, to protect all creditors of the debtors.

13

While I believe there is less of a fair ground for

14

litigation on the second point which is raised only by the

15

moving states, namely that notwithstanding there being any

16

specific protection for them in the Bankruptcy Code, their

17

status as a governmental entity takes them out of the reach

18

of this particular plan injunction.

the injunction at this point given the creditors’ other

agreements applies just to the creditors’ right to pursue

monetary claims against the third parties.

22

claims where they overlap with the claims against the

Debtor’s estate and by the Debtor’s estate, as I believe

4

they are cabined under the plan.

5

I will note that the moving states have at times

argued that that public interest extends to their right to

take discovery and engage in a trial, but I will also note

8

that they have touted in this motion the benefits of the so-

called national settlement in the multi-district litigation

10

in which two of the three of them are parties where there

11

has been no trial by them, and I believe far less discovery

that occurred in this case, that they would have and did

have direct access to.

14

that package of issues is an issue for consideration

appropriately under the first prong of the test for

obtaining a stay pending appeal.

But with that also I believe that

The other most critical factor is whether the

19

intents and purpose, although the movants have each

20

attempted to argue other injuries, the injury that they

21

posit as an irreparable injury is the risk that during the

course of their appeals, the plan would be so far

23

consummated that the appeals would become equitably moot.

24

court’s ability to issue a stay pending appeal of a district

court’s order.

The provisions of Rule 8007 and Rule 8025 do

not entirely mesh, as noted by the district court in Credit

11

12

(S.D.N.Y. 2016).

13

plenty of cases where bankruptcy courts have limited their

14

stays because of Rule 8025 up to the date of the district

court’s ruling.

16

But as I’ve previously cited, there are

I believe that is appropriate here not only

17

because of Rule 8025, but also because of the distinctly

18

different factual considerations underlying a request for a

19

stay pending appeal in these appeals and in these cases for

20

a stay pending appeal through the district court’s ruling

21

and a stay thereafter.

22

The district court has made it clear that it is on

23

a fast track to determining the appeal, which it will hear

24

oral argument on at the end of November and may well rule on

25

by the end of the first week of December.

Moreover, the

Page 269

appellees have stipulated and will be prepared to add to

2

that stipulation based on the record at oral argument that

they will not cause the effective date to occur, that is the

effective date of the plan, until the earlier of the

They have also stipulated that they will not argue
equitable mootness to a subsequent appellate court, whether

10

that’s the Second Circuit or the Supreme Court based on

11

actions taken prior to the effective date of the plan,

12

including in respect of the advance order.

13

Based on my review of the plan in addition to that

14

stipulation, it is highly unlikely that the plan would

15

permit any actions to be taken prior to the effective date

16

that would come anywhere close to the types of transactions

that give rise to equitable mootness under the law of the

25

Finally, they have stated -- and again, this would

be a condition for my order -- that they would render the

3

movant’s equitable mootness arguments moot by agreeing that

4

the hearing on the sentencing of the debtors under the DOJ

5

settlement agreement, that that hearing would be no earlier

6

than December 31, which it is clear is the actual date that

7

will be one where there is ample notice, clearly more than

8

14 days’ notice, to the appellants, including the moving

9

parties here.

10

Given all of the foregoing and the burden of proof

11

as to irreparable harm that the movants have, I conclude

12

that they have not established irreparable harm with respect

13

to a stay which I believe is the only appropriate stay that

14

I could grant, which is to the date of the district court

15

ruling and a reasonable outside date wherein there would be

16

sufficient notice for the movants to renew a stay motion in

17

the district court.

18

The Debtors have suggested December 31 for that

19

outside date, and it has been suggested to me by the movants

20

that that date, being New Year’s Eve and during the holiday

season, may place an undue burden on the district court in

on the conditions that I just stated for the movants

23

And accordingly, I believe that a key element

I will also address, however, the last two prongs

24

that the movants would have to show, namely that there is no

25

substantial injury to other parties interested in the

212-267-6868

Page 272
1

proceeding and where the public’s interest lies.

2

As far as there being no substantial harm to other

3

parties interested, the record here is clear and I believe,

4

frankly, uncontroverted that there is to the contrary

5

substantial harm to the Debtor’s creditors, the vast

6

majority of whom have either not objected to the plan and/or

7

voted in favor of the plan affirmatively in each instance,

8

the vast majority that is.

9

After the Debtors are ready to have the effective

10

date of the plan occur, and it appears to me that that would

11

not be realistically before December 31, although perhaps a

12

week before they could be ready, after that date when they

13

are ready, every day that they do not implement the

14

effective date which starts the process of liquidating

15

personal injury claims and making distributions on them and

16

making the initial distributions for abatement purposes

17

seriously causes harm to the creditors.

18

that the personal injury creditors bargained for a rapid

19

payout, which is reflected not only in their bargaining for

20

a fixed, upfront sum of several hundred million dollars, but

21

also the procedures they’ve adopted for consistent with due

22

process and the burden of proof a streamlined option to

23

liquidate one’s proof of claim.

24
25

It is clear to me

Similarly, the roughly up to a billion dollars
minus the funds going to the personal injury creditors would

Page 273
1

be going out shortly after the effective date through 2023

2

for abatement purposes, as well as the $225 million payment

3

to the United States, which although not specifically

4

earmarked for abatement purposes, United States has

5

represented the vast majority of which will go to hospitals

6

and other care facilities.

7

Mr. Guard as far as the payments are concerned at Paragraphs

8

9 through 13 of his declaration as well as at Paragraphs 7

9

through 9 and 12 through 21 and in the summary at Paragraph

This is amply testified to by

10

11

address in Paragraph 22 and 23 the funding of Newco and

12

setting it up as a public benefit company to focus on

13

developing products at a reasonable price to combat the

14

opioid crisis.

15

That declaration also

As Mr. Guard eloquently summarized, many states

16

have been litigating these issues since, well -- I’ll quote

17

him, because it’s actually quite telling -- for as long as

18

five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy case in

19

addition to the two years of this bankruptcy case.

20

believe that that length of time was necessary to satisfy

21

the due process Iridium and Metromedia factors as well as to

22

negotiate the intricate intercreditor deals in the plan.

23

The additional time of a stay pending appeal after the

24

district court’s ruling is necessary only to have further

25

appeals.

212-267-6868

I

There is nothing else that would hold up the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 274
1

payment of the money.

2

As Ms. Juaire and Ms. Trainor eloquently have

3

testified, that payment is, if made, to be put to use both

4

for the immediate needs of the individual victims and for

5

abatement purposes at a time when every dollar counts.

6

as time passes, the problem only gets worse.

7

And

As testified to by Mr. Guard and Mr. Jorgenson,

8

opioid deaths have been increasing over the last two years

9

at a very disturbing level, roughly 30 percent nationally,

10

such that in the last year of March to March, roughly 200

11

opioid-related overdose deaths occur each day.

12

I agree with the states of Washington and

13

Connecticut that if the parties could all agree that those

14

initial distributions could be made and the parties who are

15

appealing would take the risk on equitable mootness with

16

regard to those distributions, that would be all to the

17

good.

18

seem to be prepared to agree to such a resolution to get

19

money out promptly.

But the U.S. Trustee and the State of Maryland do not

20

So on the one hand, we have that clear, tangible

21

harm.

On the other hand, post the date when the Debtors

22

would be ready to go effective, which, again, would be at

23

the end of this year, we have tangible harm as described in

24

the Juaire, Trainor, Guard and Jorgenson declarations,

25

contrasted with the legitimate but non-economic harm of

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 275
1

having extra layers of appeal.

2

The public interest factor in some respects

3

dovetails with the foregoing analysis.

The U.S. Trustee

4

states that it is protecting the interests of those who did

5

not object to the plan but did not affirmatively accept it

6

and those who did object to the plan.

7

provided any information to me that would indicate that

8

those parties would effectively be able to pursue their

9

claims against the released parties to recover anything and

It has not, however,

10

would not -- and in addition would not recover any amounts

11

from the Debtors.

12

The vindication of that public policy, i.e.

13

protecting the minority, at some point -- and I believe that

14

point comes soon after the Debtors are ready for the

15

effective date, although maybe with enough time to have an

16

expedited appeal to the circuit depending on the seriousness

17

of the issues on appeal -- is sufficient to carry the day on

18

the public policy point.

19

by the district court if there is a motion for a stay after

20

its ruling.

21

But those issues can be addressed

In light of its assessment of all four factors,

22

including the first factor, the likelihood of success on

23

appeal, and with the benefit of this record which, again, is

24

extensive with extensive evidence offered by the party that

25

doesn’t have the burden of proof on this issue, the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 276
1

objectants, with no evidence offered for what I’ll refer to

2

as the longer stay issue of the balance of harms by the

3

movants.

4

The other public interest factor I have been told

5

is the deterrence factor.

I will note, however, that at

6

some point the public’s desire to get paid may well outpace

7

that deterrence factor, particularly where, again, the issue

8

is one simply of a fight over money and the movants can

9

simply not close their eyes to the fact that their

10

litigation alternatives are ones where they already with

11

regard to other defendants that they have pursued have

12

resulted in settlements rather than trials and where the

13

effect of a lengthy stay would prevent the release of the

14

document repository which can be used not only by the public

15

and academics, but also to actually fight the remaining

16

trials and litigation that’s pending against other parties.

Counsel for the Ad Hoc Committee of Personal

7

See also Cayuga Indian

That latter decision

Again, I do not believe a bond is required with

8

respect to the order that I will grant, which denies the

9

stay request.

But I am denying the U.S. Trustee’s request

10

for a broader stay, i.e. one that would last through the

11

entire appellate process because it is not posting a bond.

12

And I would deny a similar request by the movant states

13

because they have not offered to post a bond where it is

14

clear that there would be substantial harm to third parties

15

occasioned by delay after the date when the Debtors have

16

acknowledged they will, and only by that date, be ready to

17

go effective with their plan.

18

Counsel for the Ad Hoc Committee of Personal

19

Injury Claimants has also suggested that I oppose additional

20

reciprocal conditions on my not granting the motion,

21

reciprocal to the conditions that I am imposing on the

22

debtors and the other plan proponents.

23

go to any efforts by the movants to delay emergence other

24

than of course through the appellate process.

25

include continuing their commitment to an expedited

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions

They would basically

That would

516-608-2400

Page 279
1

appellate process, not seeking to adjourn the sentencing

2

hearing before the district court in New Jersey and the

3

like.

4

I am not prepared to impose those conditions.

5

However, I will reserve the appellee’s right to revisit

6

those conditions if such delaying tactics are undertaken.

7

don’t believe they will be because I believe they are

8

antithetical to the stated goals of the movants to expedite

9

the appeal process and get money out to claimants.

But if

10

that proves not to be the case, then I will lift the

11

conditions that I am imposing as a quid pro quo to my not

12

granting the stay motions.

13

I

I noted that the Canadian claimants’ motion

14

essentially rides along on the mootness point with the other

15

three motions that I have described.

16

it addresses arguments unique to the Canadian claimants

17

based on their assertions that they are sovereign entities

18

and therefore that their rights cannot be constrained.

19

have clearly disagreed with that in my confirmation ruling.

20

On the merits point,

I

I will also note that the objections to the

21

Canadian claimants’ points on this argument are well taken.

22

Canadian claimants, not all of them, but Canadian claimants

23

in their group have filed proofs of claim in these cases on

24

behalf of all of the claimants, which would subject them to

25

the court’s jurisdiction.

212-267-6868

Moreover, the claimants’ rights

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 280
1

are not specifically protected under the Bankruptcy Code.

2

They fall into the waiver of sovereign immunity for

3

governmental entities.

4

And again, I believe that the comprehensive

5

bankruptcy scheme recognized by not only Ortiz but also

6

Butner and the circuit in Manville IV, 606 F.3d 135, all

7

contemplate that those types of rights can be constrained by

8

the Court even where they pertain to or limit the ability to

9

pursue claims that are direct claims, at least where those

10

direct claims overlap with claims assertable by all

11

creditors and based on actions that are primarily actions

12

through the Debtors.

13

So I will look for an order consistent with my

14

ruling.

15

asking for a hearing date, but only a notice of the hearing

16

date (indiscernible) the hearing date.

17

the outer date for their condition beyond December 31, but

18

that will be subject to the district court’s schedule,

19

obviously tying into the commitment that has already been

20

given by the appellees of a 14-day notice of the actual

21

effective date, which is all tied to giving the movants time

22

to renew their motion for appeal -- I’m sorry, for a stay

23

pending appeal, excuse me.

24
25

I will not require a notice of when the Debtors are

I will not extend
