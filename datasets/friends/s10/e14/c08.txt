Joey Tribbiani: Ow!
Girl: Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Girl: I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh.
Mackenzie: I hate my parents.
Joey Tribbiani: I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Mackenzie: Like what?
Joey Tribbiani: Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Mackenzie: What are you? Eight?
Joey Tribbiani: Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
Mackenzie: I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Joey Tribbiani: Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
Mackenzie: I really don't.
Joey Tribbiani: What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Mackenzie: My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
Mackenzie: This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Mackenzie: Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, maybe.
Mackenzie: Then you gotta let them go.
Joey Tribbiani: I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Mackenzie: I read a lot.
Joey Tribbiani: Just when I thought we could be friends.
