Richard Burke: Chandler.
Chandler Bing: Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Richard Burke: She's not here and please come in.
Chandler Bing: Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Richard Burke: Okay, she was here, but she left.
Chandler Bing: Well where did she go?
Richard Burke: Well she said she had to think things over.
Chandler Bing: Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Richard Burke: Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Chandler Bing: Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Richard Burke: Well all right, one thing happened?
Chandler Bing: Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Richard Burke: Well I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing: And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Richard Burke: Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Chandler Bing: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Richard Burke: Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Chandler Bing: It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Richard Burke: You were gonna propose?
Chandler Bing: Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Richard Burke: No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
Chandler Bing: Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Richard Burke: I know. I hate that!
