Phoebe Buffay: Hello?
Rachel Green: Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, Rach!
Rachel Green: This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Phoebe Buffay: You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
Rachel Green: I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
Rachel Green: He's not stoned.
Phoebe Buffay: Did he go out for a cigarette?
Rachel Green: Yeah, four times.
Phoebe Buffay: My dear, sweet Rach.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Phoebe Buffay: By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
