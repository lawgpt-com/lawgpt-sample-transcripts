Chandler Bing: Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?

Chandler Bing: Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?

Chandler Bing: Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Eddie Menuek: Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Chandler Bing: Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Eddie Menuek: Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Chandler Bing: Your last roommate's kidney?
Eddie Menuek: That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
