Phoebe Buffay: I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Monica Geller: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Chandler Bing: Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Monica Geller: Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Chandler Bing: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Phoebe Buffay: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Chandler Bing: They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Chandler Bing: Glass, sand, whatever.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Monica Geller: Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I can still do that.
Monica Geller: How are you still single?!
Chandler Bing: All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Monica Geller: Good. What made you change your mind?
Chandler Bing: I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Phoebe Buffay: How did that happen?!!
Chandler Bing: Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Monica Geller: Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
