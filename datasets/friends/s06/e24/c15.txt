Richard Burke: Hi!
Monica Geller: Richard!
Richard Burke: Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Monica Geller: Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Richard Burke: Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Monica Geller: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Richard Burke: No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
