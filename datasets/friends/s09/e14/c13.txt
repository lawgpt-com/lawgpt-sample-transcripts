Steve: I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.
Rachel Green: No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Steve: Really?
Rachel Green: Don't touch my coat!
Rachel Green: Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Monica Geller: Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Rachel Green: Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Rachel Green: Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
Monica Geller: Hey, did you stop by here?
Rachel Green: No.
Monica Geller: Oh my god, then...
Monica Geller: Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
Rachel Green: What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Monica Geller: Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
Monica Geller: Why the hell did you take her?
Joey Tribbiani: Because you two were having sex!
Monica Geller: No, we weren't!
Joey Tribbiani: Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Chandler Bing: All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Chandler Bing: No, no, no.
Monica Geller: No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Monica Geller: Unless what?
Joey Tribbiani: Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Chandler Bing: What? Why?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Chandler Bing: Your family name is Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani: You almost had me.
