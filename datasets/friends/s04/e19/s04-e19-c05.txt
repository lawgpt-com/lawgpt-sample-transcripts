Phoebe Buffay: That's too hard. Too hard!
Monica Geller: All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Rachel Green: Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Chandler Bing: No thank you.
Joey Tribbiani: Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Chandler Bing: Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Joey Tribbiani: Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Chandler Bing: Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Joey Tribbiani: It's the Knicks!
Chandler Bing: Screw the Knicks!
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa!
Chandler Bing: I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Joey Tribbiani: Huh.
Chandler Bing: And the Knicks rule all.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
Chandler Bing: No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Rachel Green: All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Joey Tribbiani: Done!
Rachel Green: Let me finish.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh.
Rachel Green: I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Phoebe Buffay: Or you could end up with everything.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, I like that.
Monica Geller: All right, so what do you say?
Chandler Bing: No!
Monica Geller: Oh, just do it!!
Chandler Bing: Op, op, I'm convinced!
Joey Tribbiani: Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Chandler Bing: All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Joey Tribbiani: All right!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Rachel Green: Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay!
Chandler Bing: Okay!
Phoebe Buffay: This is great!
Joey Tribbiani: What's the game?! What's the game?!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
