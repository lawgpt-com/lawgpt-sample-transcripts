Joey Tribbiani: Rach, you sure you wanna do this?
Rachel Green: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Joey Tribbiani: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Rachel Green: Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
Joey Tribbiani: Ok, yeah, got it.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: This thing welded shut?!
Rachel Green: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
Rachel Green: Oh!
Rachel Green: Ow!
Joey Tribbiani: Sorry!
Rachel Green: Well this is romantic!
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Rachel Green: It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Joey Tribbiani: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Rachel Green: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
Joey Tribbiani: NAH! I don't have another level!!
