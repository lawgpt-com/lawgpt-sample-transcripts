Joshua Burgin: Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Rachel Green: Well, at least that's a great suit.
Joshua Burgin: Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
Rachel Green: Okay.
Stephen Waltham: Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Rachel Green: No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
