Rachel Green: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica Geller: This woman's living my life.
Rachel Green: What?
Monica Geller: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Rachel Green: You're not an artist.
Monica Geller: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Rachel Green: Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Monica Geller: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Rachel Green: Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Monica Geller: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Rachel Green: Nooo...
Monica Geller: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
