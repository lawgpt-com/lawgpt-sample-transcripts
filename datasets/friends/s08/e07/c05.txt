Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Eric: Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
Eric: Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Eric: Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just...I got so angry just looking at her......face.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: I'm sorry. I just...when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe this is too weird.
Eric: No wait! There's only a problem when I look at you. Oh I got it! I got it.
Phoebe Buffay: No don't tear out your eyes!!
Eric: I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
Eric: Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Phoebe Buffay: Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
