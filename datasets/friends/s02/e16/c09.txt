Joey Tribbiani: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Chandler Bing: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Joey Tribbiani: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Chandler Bing: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Chandler Bing: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Joey Tribbiani: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Chandler Bing: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Joey Tribbiani: Well that's how I feel.
Chandler Bing: Well then maybe you should take it.
Joey Tribbiani: Well then maybe I will.
Chandler Bing: Fine with me.
Joey Tribbiani: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
