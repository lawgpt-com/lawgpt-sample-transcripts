Ross Geller: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.

Ross Geller: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Russell: I see. Have you considered therapy?
Ross Geller: I think just the annulment for today.
Russell: There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Ross Geller: Easy.
Russell: And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
Ross Geller: No problem.
Russell: And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ross Geller: Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Russell: Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Ross Geller: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
