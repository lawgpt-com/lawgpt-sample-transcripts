Chandler Bing: Hey.
Ross Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Ross Geller: Do you say this stuff to girls?
Big Bully: Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Little Bully: And look where they're sitting.
Ross Geller: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Big Bully: Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Little Bully: Yeah.
Big Bully: This couch belongs to us.
Chandler Bing: Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Big Bully: You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Ross Geller: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Gunther: Fellas, these guys were here first.
Big Bully: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Little Bully: Sorry.
Gunther: There you go.
Ross Geller: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.

Chandler Bing: Don't play with his things.
Ross Geller: I know.
Big Bully: Alright, let's take this outside.
Ross Geller: Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?

Chandler Bing: You had to ask.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.

Chandler Bing: I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
