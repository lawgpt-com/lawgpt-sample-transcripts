Phoebe Buffay: There he is!
Chandler Bing: Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Chandler Bing: Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Customer: Who is it?
Phoebe Buffay: It is your office.
Customer: Do you know who at my office?
Phoebe Buffay: John?
Customer: Oh John! Great!
unknown: nan
Phoebe Buffay: Here he is.
Chandler Bing: Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! I would trade.
Customer: It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Chandler Bing: No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Customer: You're dying?!
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Chandler Bing: Okay, that's enough honey!
Customer: I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Chandler Bing: Great! Okay, here.
Customer: All right.
Chandler Bing: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
