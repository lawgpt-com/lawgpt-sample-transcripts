Rachel Green: Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?

Rachel Green: Hey, they were popular when I left!
Gavin Mitchell: Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
Rachel Green: Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
Gavin Mitchell: That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
Rachel Green: Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
Gavin Mitchell: Fine.
Rachel Green: Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Gavin Mitchell: Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
Rachel Green: Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
