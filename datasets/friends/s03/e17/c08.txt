Phoebe Buffay: Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Rachel Green: Great!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, what town are we near?
Monica Geller: Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Phoebe Buffay: Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Rachel Green: Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Rachel Green: I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Rachel Green: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Monica Geller: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Rachel Green: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Phoebe Buffay: But if...
Rachel Green: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
