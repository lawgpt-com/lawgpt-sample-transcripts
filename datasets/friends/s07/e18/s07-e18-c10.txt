Rachel Green: Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Joey Tribbiani: Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Rachel Green: Oh my God you stole her award!
Joey Tribbiani: No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Rachel Green: Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Joey Tribbiani: Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Rachel Green: Joey, you have got to take this back!
Joey Tribbiani: But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Rachel Green: No! Joey!
Joey Tribbiani: Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Rachel Green: Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Joey Tribbiani: No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Rachel Green: Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Joey Tribbiani: I can scratch that right off.
Rachel Green: Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Joey Tribbiani: All right!
Rachel Green: All right? Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani: I'll take it back tomorrow.
Rachel Green: Thank you.
