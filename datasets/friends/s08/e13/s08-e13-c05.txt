Ross Geller: I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
Rachel Green: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Dr. Long: Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
Ross Geller: Uh, no. No, we're not.
Rachel Green: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Dr. Long: That's right. But if you don't want to know...
Ross Geller: No, no, we want to wait, right?
Rachel Green: Right. Right.
Dr. Long: Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo.
Rachel Green: So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Ross Geller: What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
Rachel Green: Third one from the left?
Ross Geller: Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!
Rachel Green: What?!
Ross Geller: You're looking!
Rachel Green: I didn't!
Ross Geller: I saw you!
Rachel Green: Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Ross Geller: Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Rachel Green: Okay, but Ross just listen to me...
Ross Geller: No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
Rachel Green: But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Ross Geller: Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
Rachel Green: Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
