Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Tour Guide: You mean Dr. Geller?
Joey Tribbiani: Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Tour Guide: Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, how-how come?
Tour Guide: That's just the way it is.
Joey Tribbiani: That's crazy.
Tour Guide: Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
Joey Tribbiani: I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Ross Geller: That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
