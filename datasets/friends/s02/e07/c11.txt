Rachel Green: Hi.
Ross Geller: I didn't get a cat.
Rachel Green: Oh, that's um, interesting.
Ross Geller: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Rachel Green: Alright, I got it Ross.
Ross Geller: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rachel Green: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Ross Geller: Then you should have said something before I met her.
Rachel Green: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Ross Geller: There was never a good time.
Rachel Green: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Ross Geller: Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Rachel Green: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Ross Geller: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Rachel Green: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Ross Geller: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Rachel Green: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Ross Geller: Fine.
Rachel Green: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ross Geller: Good.
Rachel Green: Good.
Rachel Green: And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Ross Geller: Try the bottom one.
