Phoebe Buffay: So how are things going with Paul?
Rachel Green: Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Phoebe Buffay: That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Rachel Green: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Phoebe Buffay: No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Paul Stevens: Hi honey.
Rachel Green: Hi!
Phoebe Buffay: Watch this.
Paul Stevens: How are you?
Rachel Green: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Hi Paul!
Paul Stevens: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: So how are things going with you?

Ross Geller: Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Ross Geller: Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Phoebe Buffay: I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Ross Geller: What?! Why?!
Phoebe Buffay: Please, I think you know why.
Ross Geller: I can't think of anything.
Phoebe Buffay: Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Ross Geller: Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Phoebe Buffay: Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Ross Geller: I guess it could.
Phoebe Buffay: Well then I think that's it.
Ross Geller: Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
