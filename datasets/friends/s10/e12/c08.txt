Phoebe Buffay: No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm glad we had this little talk.
Mike Hannigan: Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Monica Geller: Bye.
Mike Hannigan: Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, what's it doing here?
Monica Geller: Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
Joey Tribbiani: How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
