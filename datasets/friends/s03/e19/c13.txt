Chandler Bing: I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Joey Tribbiani: Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Chandler Bing: Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Joey Tribbiani: God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Chandler Bing: I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Chandler Bing: I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Chandler Bing: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
