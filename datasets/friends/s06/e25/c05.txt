Joey Tribbiani: Hey Monica!
Monica Geller: Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Joey Tribbiani: This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Monica Geller: Yeah, it's great.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Monica Geller: I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Monica Geller: It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, you know Chandler.
Monica Geller: No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe you changed?
Monica Geller: I didn't change!
Joey Tribbiani: Maybe that's the problem.
Monica Geller: What?!
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica Geller: Is that some kind of boat talk?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Monica Geller: What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Joey Tribbiani: Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Monica Geller: Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Joey Tribbiani: There are?
Monica Geller: Yeah! Richard!
Joey Tribbiani: R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Monica Geller: That's right.
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler loves marriage!!
Monica Geller: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Joey Tribbiani: You got that from what I said?!
