Chandler Bing: Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Monica Geller: Keep talking.
Chandler Bing: I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Monica Geller: Really?
Chandler Bing: Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Monica Geller: Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Chandler Bing: Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Monica Geller: But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Monica Geller: Yeah.
