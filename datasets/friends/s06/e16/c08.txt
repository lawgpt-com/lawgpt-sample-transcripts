Chandler Bing: We can't do this.
Monica Geller: No! Oyster?
Chandler Bing: Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Monica Geller: Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Chandler Bing: I do like that.
Monica Geller: It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Chandler Bing: Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Monica Geller: Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Chandler Bing: Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Monica Geller: Noo!! Okay!!
Chandler Bing: Okay!
Monica Geller: Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Chandler Bing: I have some moves.
Monica Geller: I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, let's just forget it.
Monica Geller: What if I turn out the lights?
Chandler Bing: Okay!
