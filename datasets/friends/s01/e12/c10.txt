Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Are you moving out?
Rachel Green: No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Phoebe Buffay: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Rachel Green: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Rachel Green: Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Rachel Green: Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Rachel Green: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Phoebe Buffay: Which proves that I never lie.
Rachel Green: I guess you don't.
Phoebe Buffay: Paolo made a pass at me.
