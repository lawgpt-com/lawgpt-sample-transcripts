Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
Frank Buffay Jr.: No, of course we're not.
Phoebe Buffay: Insane.
Frank Buffay Jr.: I know.
Phoebe Buffay: Alice would never go for it, right?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Huh.
Phoebe Buffay: Frank Jr.Jr.?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh.
Frank Buffay Jr.: What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
Phoebe Buffay: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
Frank Buffay Jr.: How about tomorrow?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
Frank Buffay Jr.: You'd do that for us?
Phoebe Buffay: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
