Monica Geller: Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
Chandler Bing: How long was I in there?
Monica Geller: Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Chandler Bing: Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Monica Geller: Don't you want to look through the rest?
Chandler Bing: I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Monica Geller: You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
Chandler Bing: I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Monica Geller: I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
Chandler Bing: Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Monica Geller: I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Chandler Bing: "The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
Monica Geller: "Marriage. It's not for everybody."
