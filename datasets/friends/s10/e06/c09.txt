Benjamin Hobart: The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?
Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
Benjamin Hobart: Interesting.
Ross Geller: I guess!
Benjamin Hobart: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?
Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Benjamin Hobart: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
Ross Geller: What? I... I...
Benjamin Hobart: Care to venture a guess?
Ross Geller: May 12th?
Benjamin Hobart: That's not even kinda close! Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
Dr. Li: Half a dozen.
Benjamin Hobart: I see, and Dr. Biely?
Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.
Benjamin Hobart: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Ross Geller: Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Benjamin Hobart: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
Ross Geller: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Benjamin Hobart: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
Ross Geller: um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
Benjamin Hobart: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Ross Geller: Ok. B - O - S ...
Benjamin Hobart: No, it starts with a silent "M".
Ross Geller: Oh come on!!
