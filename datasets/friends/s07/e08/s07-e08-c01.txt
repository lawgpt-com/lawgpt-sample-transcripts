Ross Geller: Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Chandler Bing: No, no, no. No-no-no.
Joey Tribbiani: Shhhh!
Ross Geller: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Chandler Bing: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Ross Geller: What? That's like insanely easy!
Chandler Bing: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Monica Geller: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Ross Geller: What? You forgot fourteen states?
Monica Geller: Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
