Rachel Green: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Ross Geller: Uh-huh.
Rachel Green: I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Ross Geller: Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Rachel Green: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Ross Geller: Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Rachel Green: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Ross Geller: Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Phoebe Buffay: No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
