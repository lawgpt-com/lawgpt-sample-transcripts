Monica Geller: Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: Is Amanda here yet?
Phoebe Buffay: No.
Monica Geller: Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Monica Geller: Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
Phoebe Buffay: Are you kidding, I love it!
Phoebe Buffay: Hi!
Monica Geller: Hi!
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Hi!
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Hello!
Amanda Buffamonteezi: It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Monica Geller: Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Smell my neck! It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
Phoebe Buffay: Musty!
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
Monica Geller: When were we not friends?
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .
Monica Geller: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Amanda Buffamonteezi: No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
Monica Geller: You were going to cut me out?
Phoebe Buffay: Well...kinda.
Monica Geller: Oh My God!
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Monica Geller: Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Monica Geller: Nope!
