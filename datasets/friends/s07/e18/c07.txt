Jake: Bye Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay bye.
Jake: All right. Bye.
Phoebe Buffay: Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Jake: I miss you already!!
Phoebe Buffay: I miss you too!!!!
Monica Geller: See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Chandler Bing: Oh totally! Pull my finger.
