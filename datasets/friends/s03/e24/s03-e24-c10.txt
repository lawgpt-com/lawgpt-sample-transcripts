Monica Geller: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Monica Geller: Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Ross Geller: Hot dog?
Monica Geller: Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross Geller: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, that's too bad!
Ross Geller: No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Ross Geller: Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Chandler Bing: Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Ross Geller: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, the fight's starting!
Ross Geller: Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Chandler Bing: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Joey Tribbiani: Fight's over!
