Joey Tribbiani: Morning!
Rachel Green: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Joey Tribbiani: Pretty good.
Rachel Green: Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Rachel Green: What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Rachel Green: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Joey Tribbiani: Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Rachel Green: Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Rachel Green: Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Joey Tribbiani: Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Joey's Date: Hi!
Rachel Green: Hi.
Joey's Date: Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Rachel Green: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Joey's Date: You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Rachel Green: Hi.
Erin: Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Rachel Green: Would you like some pancakes?
