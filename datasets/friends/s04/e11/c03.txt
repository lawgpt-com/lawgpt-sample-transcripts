Kathy: Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Kathy: Oh!
Monica Geller: I am so jealous.
Rachel Green: You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Chandler Bing: Yes. Right where?
Monica Geller: In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Chandler Bing: Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Monica Geller: And the sex?
Chandler Bing: All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Rachel Green: Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Ross Geller: That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Rachel Green: Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Chandler Bing: No, he's right, I'm totally lying.

Monica Geller: Then what is it?
Chandler Bing: Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Ross Geller: And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Chandler Bing: No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Chandler Bing: Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Monica Geller: So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Chandler Bing: We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Monica Geller: Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Chandler Bing: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Yeah!
Ross Geller: Just go for it Chandler.
Monica Geller: Yeah, you should.
Rachel Green: Yeah, you should, really.
Monica Geller: Go on.
Chandler Bing: All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
