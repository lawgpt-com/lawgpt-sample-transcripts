Monica Geller: Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.

Richard Burke: Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.

Monica Geller: Uh-huh.
Richard Burke: Look I want you, now.
Monica Geller: That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
