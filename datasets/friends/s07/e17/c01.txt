Phoebe Buffay: Since when are you into swing music?
Chandler Bing: Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Monica Geller: Chandler.
Chandler Bing: Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Monica Geller: I will.
Chandler Bing: Do you want me to call?

Phoebe Buffay: What is your job?
Chandler Bing: Staying out of the way.
