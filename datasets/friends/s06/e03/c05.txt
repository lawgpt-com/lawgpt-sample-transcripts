Rachel Green: Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Phoebe Buffay: Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Rachel Green: You're just staring into space.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
Rachel Green: This one?
Phoebe Buffay: It worked!
Rachel Green: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Phoebe Buffay: Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey.
Ross Geller: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Rachel Green: Yeah! Why?
Ross Geller: Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Rachel Green: That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Ross Geller: Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Rachel Green: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!

Ross Geller: Okay, you go grab it!
Phoebe Buffay: I saw it.
Ross Geller: I don't know what you're talking about.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Ross Geller: Look, I do not re-love her.
Phoebe Buffay: I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Ross Geller: Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Rachel Green: Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Ross Geller: You can live with me.
Rachel Green: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Ross Geller: What?
