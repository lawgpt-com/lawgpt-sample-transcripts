Joey Tribbiani: So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Chandler Bing: But you found the keys to his clothes?
Joey Tribbiani: No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Monica Geller: And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Joey Tribbiani: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Chandler Bing: That is true.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Monica Geller: Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Chandler Bing: Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Monica Geller: All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Phoebe Buffay: What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
Monica Geller: The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Phoebe Buffay: But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Monica Geller: He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Phoebe Buffay: But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Chandler Bing: I think that's gum.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Chandler Bing: Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
Phoebe Buffay: A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
