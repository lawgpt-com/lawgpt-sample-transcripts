Joey Tribbiani: Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
Chandler Bing: Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Monica Geller: Chandler! You're home!
Chandler Bing: That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Monica Geller: What are you saying?
Chandler Bing: Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Monica Geller: There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
Joey Tribbiani: All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!
Chandler Bing: What is he doing?
Monica Geller: I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Joey Tribbiani: Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Chandler Bing: All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.
Joey Tribbiani: Why do I smell men's cologne?
Monica Geller: I think that's you.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Chandler Bing: There's nobody here Joe.
Joey Tribbiani: I guess not.
Monica Geller: I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller: Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
Chandler Bing: I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
