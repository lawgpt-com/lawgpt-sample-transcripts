The Doctor: It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Jack Geller: Of course it did. They're made of wicker.

Monica Geller: What?! What is it?
The Doctor: You brought a carrot.
Chandler Bing: What?
The Doctor: This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Rachel Green: You brought a carrot?!
Judy Geller: Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Monica Geller: God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
The Doctor: It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Chandler Bing: Without my toe?! I need my toe!
