Joey Tribbiani: All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Casting Guy: Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Casting Guy: Five oh dollars.
Joey Tribbiani: Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
Casting Guy: That's great.
Joey Tribbiani: And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Casting Guy: Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Joey Tribbiani: No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
