Joey Tribbiani: Nothing. No, nothing.

Emily Waltham: Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Ross Geller: I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Emily Waltham: I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Ross Geller: Hi.
Emily Waltham: Ross, I love you!
Ross Geller: Ohh! Thank you.
