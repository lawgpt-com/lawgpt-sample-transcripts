Phoebe Buffay: "Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.

Jason: Hey. I was...
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Jason: I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Vince: Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Vince: What?!
Jason: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Vince: Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Jason: Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Phoebe Buffay: Really?!
Jason: Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Vince: You haven't?
Jason: You have?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, this is none of my business.
Jason: I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Jason: Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, that could've been really awkward.
Vince: You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Vince: Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
