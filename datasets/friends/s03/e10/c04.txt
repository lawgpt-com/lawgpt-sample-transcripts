Ross Geller: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Sarah Tuttle: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Ross Geller: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Sarah Tuttle: Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Ross Geller: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Sarah Tuttle: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Ross Geller: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Sarah Tuttle: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Sarah Tuttle: So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Ross Geller: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Sarah Tuttle: Five dollars a box.
Ross Geller: And what is second prize?
Sarah Tuttle: A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Ross Geller: Well, that makes sense.
Sarah Tuttle: Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Ross Geller: Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Sarah Tuttle: Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
