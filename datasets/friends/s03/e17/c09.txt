Monica Geller: Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Ross Geller: Oh, now you want a favour?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, please.
Ross Geller: Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Carol Willick: Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Ross Geller: No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
Carol Willick: Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Ross Geller: No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
Carol Willick: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Ross Geller: Yeah, you're right.
Carol Willick: Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Ross Geller: We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Carol Willick: You slept with another woman?
Ross Geller: Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
