Joey Tribbiani: All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.

Joey Tribbiani: Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Rachel Green: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Rachel Green: Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Joey Tribbiani: Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Rachel Green: Isn't that a line from the show?!
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Rachel Green: That's a line from the show too!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, you watch too much TV.
Chandler Bing: Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Chandler Bing: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Rachel Green: Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Joey Tribbiani: Iced tea.
Chandler Bing: Okay, anything for you sir?
Joey Tribbiani: Did I not just tell him?
Rachel Green: Yes, you did.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Chandler Bing: It's not all juice!
