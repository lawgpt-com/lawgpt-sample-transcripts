Franny: Hey, Monica!
Monica Geller: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Franny: You had sex, didn't you?
Monica Geller: How do you do that?
Franny: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
Monica Geller: You know Paul?
Franny: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Monica Geller: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Franny: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
