Joey Tribbiani: Vulva?
Ross Geller: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Ross Geller: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Joey Tribbiani: What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Ross Geller: Please be kidding.
Joey Tribbiani: Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Ross Geller: OK. I'm in my apartment...
Joey Tribbiani: ....yeah... what else?
Ross Geller: That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Ross Geller: Joey, please.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Ross Geller: Wow.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, now you say something.
Ross Geller: I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on! You like this woman, right?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: You want to see her again, right?
Ross Geller: Sure.
Joey Tribbiani: Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Ross Geller: OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Joey Tribbiani: Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ross Geller: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Joey Tribbiani: There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Ross Geller: I, er...
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: I want to take my tongue... and...
unknown: nan
Ross Geller: ....and....
Joey Tribbiani: Say it... say it!
Ross Geller: ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: ....with??
Ross Geller: Funny story!
Joey Tribbiani: You're not going to believe this!
Chandler Bing: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Chandler Bing: Again?
Joey Tribbiani: And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Chandler Bing: Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
