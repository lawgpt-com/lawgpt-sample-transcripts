Phoebe Buffay: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
Mike Hannigan: No, I didn't.
Joey Tribbiani: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?
Joey Tribbiani: Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
Mike Hannigan: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Mike Hannigan: What?!
Joey Tribbiani: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Do you not know each other?
Joey Tribbiani: Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
Phoebe Buffay: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
Mike Hannigan: Six!
Joey Tribbiani: What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
Phoebe Buffay: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Joey Tribbiani: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Mike Hannigan: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
Phoebe Buffay: You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Mary Ellen: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Joey Tribbiani: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm out of here.
Mike Hannigan: It was nice meeting you!
Joey Tribbiani: You're leaving too?
Mary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Joey Tribbiani: Good night!
