Ross Geller: Man, I sure miss Julie.
Chandler Bing: Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Ross Geller: You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Chandler Bing: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Joey Tribbiani: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Jade: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
Chandler Bing: What?
Jade: I got a little drunk...and naked.
Chandler Bing: Bob here.
Chandler Bing: What've you been up to?
Jade: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Chandler Bing: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Ross Geller: I know.
Chandler Bing: I'm back.
Jade: So, are we gonna get together or what?
Chandler Bing: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Jade: Great, I'll see you then.
Chandler Bing: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Ross Geller: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Chandler Bing: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Ross Geller: Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Chandler Bing: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
