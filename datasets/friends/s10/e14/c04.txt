Phoebe Buffay: This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
Clerk: How can I help you?
Phoebe Buffay: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
Clerk: You need to fill out this form.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Clerk: It can be anything you want.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, not anything, I mean...
Clerk: Yeah... anything.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, this could take a while.
Clerk: Get out of my line.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
