Monica Geller: Hey.
Rachel Green: Hey.
Monica Geller: How's the big anniversary dinner?
Rachel Green: Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Monica Geller: Ohhh, nice.
Rachel Green: No, we kinda broke up instead.
Monica Geller: What?!
Rachel Green: God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Monica Geller: That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Rachel Green: Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Monica Geller: Oh no!!
Rachel Green: No.
Monica Geller: Rachel, you and Mark?!
Rachel Green: No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
