Chandler Bing: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Janice Litman Goralnik: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Chandler Bing: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.

Chandler Bing: Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?

Chandler Bing: It was a "Wendy's!! "
