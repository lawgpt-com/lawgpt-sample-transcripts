Ross Geller: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Ross Geller: What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Ross Geller: Everything? Even the TV?
Joey Tribbiani: No! I'm putting that in my room.
Ross Geller: Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Joey Tribbiani: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Ross Geller: That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Joey Tribbiani: Five years.
Ross Geller: You've sentenced him?!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Ross Geller: Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Joey Tribbiani: No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Ross Geller: Oh, who? Me?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Ross Geller: Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Ross Geller: I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani: All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
