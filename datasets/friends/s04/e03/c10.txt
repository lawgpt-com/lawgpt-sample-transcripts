Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hi.
Phoebe Buffay: This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Monica Geller: Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Monica Geller: Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Phoebe Buffay: No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
Monica Geller: What?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Monica Geller: All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
