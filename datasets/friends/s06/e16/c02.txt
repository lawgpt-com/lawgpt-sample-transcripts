Ross Geller: Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Ross Geller: Hey, how's it going?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Monica Geller: Here you go sweetie.
Phoebe Buffay: What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Monica Geller: But, I put some honey in it.

Ross Geller: She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
Chandler Bing: No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Chandler Bing: But I think we should tell her.
Ross Geller: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Chandler Bing: Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Phoebe Buffay: I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Monica Geller: Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Chandler Bing: Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Phoebe Buffay: Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
