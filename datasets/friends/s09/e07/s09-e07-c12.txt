Theodore: I can't imagine what he sees in her.
Bitsy Hannigan: She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. Oh, hello dear...
Mike Hannigan: Hey, what's going on?
Bitsy Hannigan: We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
Mike Hannigan: A little better.
Bitsy Hannigan: By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
Theodore: You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.
Mike Hannigan: I'm not interested.
Bitsy Hannigan: Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
Mike Hannigan: All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
Bitsy Hannigan: Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!
Mike Hannigan: So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
Bitsy Hannigan: The woman you what?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah... The woman you what?
Mike Hannigan: The woman I love... I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
Phoebe Buffay: I love you too...
Mike Hannigan: You do?
Phoebe Buffay: YEAH...! How great is this...?
Mike Hannigan: Wanna get out of here?
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Mike Hannigan: Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
Phoebe Buffay: I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And Here's Something Rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
