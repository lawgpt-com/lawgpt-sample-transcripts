Ross Geller: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Joey Tribbiani: Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Ross Geller: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Ross Geller: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Joey Tribbiani: You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Ross Geller: Why?
Joey Tribbiani: It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Ross Geller: What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani: We all hate Emily!
Phoebe Buffay: Nooo!!
Monica Geller: No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah!
Chandler Bing: Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Joey Tribbiani: Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Ross Geller: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Phoebe Buffay: I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
