Ross Geller: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Chandler Bing: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Ross Geller: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
Chandler Bing: What?
Ross Geller: That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
Chandler Bing: You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Ross Geller: So?
Chandler Bing: So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Ross Geller: Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.

Chandler Bing: Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Ross Geller: Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Chandler Bing: Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Ross Geller: When I got married you slept with my sister.
Chandler Bing: That was pretty 007.
