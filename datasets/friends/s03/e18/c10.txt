Secretary: You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Peter Becker: Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Monica Geller: What the hell is this?
Peter Becker: Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Monica Geller: Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Peter Becker: Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Monica Geller: You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Employee: Umm, I'm still here.
Peter Becker: You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
Monica Geller: What?!
Peter Becker: Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Monica Geller: Okay, umm, you're a loon.
Peter Becker: Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Monica Geller: I don't know.
Peter Becker: Why not?
Monica Geller: 'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Peter Becker: One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
