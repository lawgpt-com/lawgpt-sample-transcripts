Chandler Bing: Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Joey Tribbiani: Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Chandler Bing: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Phoebe Buffay: You're actually going through with this?
Chandler Bing: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Phoebe Buffay: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
