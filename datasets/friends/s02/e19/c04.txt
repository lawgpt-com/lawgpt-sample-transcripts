Rachel Green: Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.

Phoebe Buffay: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Ross Geller: Hey you guys.
Monica Geller: Hey.
Ross Geller: Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Rachel Green: NO!
Ross Geller: No?
Rachel Green: No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Ross Geller: Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
Rachel Green: No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Monica Geller: You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Ross Geller: Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Rachel Green: Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Ross Geller: You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Rachel Green: Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay: Um-um, um-um.
Rachel Green: You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
