Ross Geller: I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Monica Geller: Dad!
Ross Geller: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Monica Geller: You what?
Ross Geller: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Monica Geller: Define fun.
Ross Geller: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Monica Geller: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Ross Geller: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Monica Geller: That's probably what they'll say.
Ross Geller: I'd like that.
