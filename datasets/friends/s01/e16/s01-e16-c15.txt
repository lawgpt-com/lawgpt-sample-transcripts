Rachel Green: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Monica Geller: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Rachel Green: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Chandler Bing: Youre not gonna lose him.
Monica Geller: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Okay.
Ross Geller: No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Phoebe Buffay: But hes falling in love with her.
