Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey. So, what did he say?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, So He Said "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Joey Tribbiani: That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
Phoebe Buffay: Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
Phoebe Buffay: Who dies?
Joey Tribbiani: Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, doctor.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay.
