Monica Geller: No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Monica Geller: It could be Amanda!

Phoebe Buffay: Ok, don't hold thy breath!
Chandler Bing: Hello? Is someone on the line?
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Yes, I was looking for Monica.

Monica Geller: We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
Chandler Bing: I get pedicures!
Monica Geller: Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
Phoebe Buffay: Why, why, why didn't you just say no!

Phoebe Buffay: Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
Monica Geller: And you would?
Phoebe Buffay: I did!
