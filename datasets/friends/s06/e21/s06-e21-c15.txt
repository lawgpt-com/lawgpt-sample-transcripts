Rachel Green: I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Paul Stevens: How to make the next one even shorter?
Rachel Green: Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Paul Stevens: Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Ross Geller: Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Paul Stevens: Are you yelling at me?!
Ross Geller: God no!
Elizabeth Stevens: Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Paul Stevens: Really?!
Ross Geller: Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Paul Stevens: Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
Ross Geller: That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Paul Stevens: Then we agree?
Ross Geller: Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Paul Stevens: Neither of us like Ross!
Elizabeth Stevens: I like Ross.
Ross Geller: Ohhh! Kids!
Rachel Green: Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Ross Geller: That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Rachel Green: Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
