Rachel Green: Morning. You wanted to see me?
Mr. Zelner: Please, come in. Have a seat.
Rachel Green: Okay look Mr. Zelner...
Mr. Zelner: Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Mr. Zelner: I've asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
Rachel Green: Oh God.
Mr. Zelner: If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby...I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
Rachel Green: Well, as long as we are clear about that.
