Monica Geller: Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Chandler Bing: Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Monica Geller: Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Chandler Bing: The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Ross Geller: Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Monica Geller: You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Ross Geller: Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
