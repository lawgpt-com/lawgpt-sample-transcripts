Monica Geller: You want some help with that?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Monica Geller: Whoa! Are you okay?
Joey Tribbiani: Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Monica Geller: It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Joey Tribbiani: That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Monica Geller: Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Joey Tribbiani: Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Monica Geller: Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Joey Tribbiani: Gotcha.
Monica Geller: This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, you bet I am!
Monica Geller: Okay, here's your penis!
