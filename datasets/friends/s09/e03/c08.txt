Mike Hannigan: I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.
Joey Tribbiani: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Mike Hannigan: I am Mike.
Joey Tribbiani: Atta boy!
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, look...

Phoebe Buffay: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Mike Hannigan: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
Joey Tribbiani: From school.
Mike Hannigan: Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
Mike Hannigan: Well, I'm a lawyer.
Joey Tribbiani: Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Mike Hannigan: Actually, I just gave up my practice.
Joey Tribbiani: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Mike Hannigan: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
Joey Tribbiani: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Mary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
