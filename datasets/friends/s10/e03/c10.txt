Monica Geller: I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Phoebe Buffay: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
Monica Geller: I'm still all those things!
Phoebe Buffay: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Monica Geller: I am scrappy.
Phoebe Buffay: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Monica Geller: It's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica Geller: I won't know what I would do without you.
Monica Geller: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I guess you're right.
Amanda Buffamonteezi: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
