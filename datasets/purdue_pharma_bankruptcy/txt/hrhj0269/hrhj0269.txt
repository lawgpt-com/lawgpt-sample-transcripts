THE COURT:

Good morning.

This is Judge Drain.

We’re here in In Re Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.

4

As I asked the Debtors to circulate to the wide

5

email list yesterday in working on my ruling on the Debtors'

6

request for confirmation of their amended Chapter 11 plan, I

7

realized that although the parties believed that they could

8

rely on their pleadings with respect to issues that were

9

contested related to plan confirmation, my review of the

10

pleadings left open some questions that I wanted to address

11

with the parties.

12

Those issues pertain to the sole remaining

13

objection by the Co-Defendant group and certain aspects of

14

the plan's treatment of these for those other than the

15

professionals that fall under the definition of professional

16

persons under the plan.

17

those disputes be available today so I could discuss them

18

with them.

19

So I asked that the parties to

In addition, I wanted an update on one issue that

20

had been left open involving the rights of Gulf and St. Paul

21

insurers.

22

remaining objection by those two parties has been resolved,

23

so we don't need to address that further.

24
25

I was informed this morning that that limited

I also was told that one aspect of the State of
West Virginia's objection to the plan had been resolved, I

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 14
1

think in part based on questions that I had from the bench,

2

which involved California's -- the State of California's,

3

that is -- carveout from contributing to the so-called one

4

percent fund for small states, which I gather, again from

5

hearing from the Debtors, has now been eliminated, and

6

instead, California is going to be contributed to the one

7

percent fund.

8

And then, finally, I noted that I had not seen a

9

revised plan that addressed the release issues that were the

10

subject of a fair amount of discussion during oral argument,

11

and that I would really benefit from seeing the changes.

12

I've been provided with a blacklined amended Chapter 11 plan

13

that reflects the parties' work to narrow the release

14

further, in light of my comments and other parties'

15

comments.

16

So that's what I want to address this morning.

17

That obviously meant that I would put off my bench ruling

18

that I had originally said I would give you all this

19

morning.

20

to give you that ruling on Wednesday, September 1st.

21

Given my hearing schedule, I will use every effort

So, unless anyone wants to make any further

22

announcement, I'd like to address the two issues that the

23

parties had left in their briefing.

24

understand them fully, but I did have a couple of questions

25

that I wanted to raise with them in each case.

212-267-6868

I'm sure they

MR. HUEBNER:
the Debtors.

Your Honor, Marshall Huebner, for

Can you hear me clearly?

3

THE COURT:

Yes.

4

MR. HUEBNER:

Just very quickly, Your Honor.

5

Obviously, I was going to announce that very good news on

6

California, and the good news on Gulf, and both apologize

7

and make sure that everybody knows that we were able to

8

negotiate substantially revised releases.

9

the number of parties, it took a lot of yesterday.

10

Obviously, given

With respect to California, Your Honor, let me say

11

two quick things, and then I'll turn it over, if Your Honor

12

would like, to Mr. Vonnegut to walk you through the changes

13

to the plan, because there are just a couple of other very

14

minor ones.

15

case, Your Honor has read everything and is ready to go,

16

then obviously, we'll skip that.

17

We're happy to do that if, as is typically the

With respect to California, Your Honor, I do want

18

to say two things.

19

of the parties really appreciate that California changed

20

their decision and agreed to make what was a voluntary

21

contribution under the structure to the intensity fund.

22

Number one, I think we and probably many

We are waiting to get back to West Virginia.

We

23

don't know, and nothing is decided yet, whether that means

24

that it resolved their objection in toto, or that was

25

something that (indiscernible) was obviously very upset and

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 16
1

ineloquent about, or whether they're still pressing for the

2

remainder of their -- for an allocation objection.

3

Obviously, as soon as there is an update, we will advise the

4

Court.

5

Finally, I should note that Your Honor very

6

clearly encouraged everybody to try to remain in

7

conversation and we will never stop trying to get a deal

8

with a very, very small number of remaining objectors.

9

know, there is certainly nothing to announce, but there are

You

10

still some conversations going on, and we, for our part,

11

will never stop trying to bring everybody into the deal and

12

see what else is possible.

13

And so with that, Your Honor, I guess the question

14

is would like Mr. Vonnegut to (indiscernible) or do you have

15

them and we should deal with Your Honor's questions for

16

whichever parties you'd like to question?

17

THE COURT:

Well, I see that there are 164 parties

18

on the line today.

19

line for the Co-Defendant and fee issues.

20

does make sense to go through the amended plan, or the

21

changes in the amended plan.

22

So it may make sense to very briefly summarize them.

23

then, I regret to have to say this, but I do have some

24

questions about them.

25

I doubt that most of them are on the

MR. HUEBNER:

212-267-6868

So it probably

I have reviewed them, though.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Veritext Legal Solutions

And

And let me

516-608-2400

Page 17

just ask all parties.

2

not great, so I've put in my headphones and would ask, as we

3

have on the prior dates, that anyone who has the ability to

4

use either wired or wireless headphones please do so, which

5

I just do think improves the audio.

6

I'm already hearing that the sound is

So with that, I will go on mute and off camera,

7

and Mr. Vonnegut to please go off mute and on camera and do

8

the quick walk-through that the Court has requested.

9

THE COURT:

10

Okay.

MR. VONNEGUT:

That's fine.

Thank you.

Your Honor, for the

11

record, Eli Vonnegut, of Davis Polk & Wardwell, on behalf of

12

the Debtors.

Can you hear me clearly?

13

THE COURT:

Yes, I can, thanks.

14

MR. VONNEGUT:

Thank you.

Your Honor, the tenth

15

amended plan filed overnight reflects a pretty new set of

16

changes to the ninth amended plan, and I'll just walk to

17

them briefly.

18

First, in the definition of excluded claim, we've

19

made clear, as we discussed in court the other day, that the

20

carveout for taxes applies to all taxes.

21

to income taxes, so we've just deleted the word income in II

22

of that defined term.

23

It's not limited

Next, you'll see a little change in the

24

architecture of how we carved out non-opioid claims from the

25

releases.

212-267-6868

So they are no longer a subset of the defined

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 18
1

term excluded claim.

2

in the two third-party release sections in 10.6(B) and

3

10.7(B) in the plan.

4

Instead, they are carved out directly

Then in excluded party, this is not a substantive

5

change.

6

effectuated the DMP settlement that was discussed with some

7

creditors after we filed the initial set of changes.

8
9

This was just cleanup related to the way that we

Then, Your Honor, you'll see -- and I'll turn it
over to Mr. Uzzi very shortly to discuss the substance of

10

this -- but the next two changes were related to the

11

broadening of the carveout for non-opioid claims.

12

see our new term is non-opioid excluded claim.

13

the claims that are excluded from the releases and that are

14

carved out directly in sections 10.6(B) and 10.7(B).

15

So you'll

Those are

In releasing parties, that is also a change

16

intended to narrow the scope of the releases.

17

back to the architecture again, in order to be encompassed

18

in a third-party release, a claim needs to be held by a

19

releasing party.

20

remove holders of causes of action and to limit the

21

releasing parties to holders of claims.

22

So just to go

And the Sacklers have agreed here to

And there's just a parenthetical here illustrating

23

exactly what is meant by the defined term, claim, although

24

that is defined as defined in the Bankruptcy Code.

25

In shareholder released parties, we've just

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 19
1

corrected a cross-cite.

It turns out to be an exhibit, not

2

a schedule, to the shareholder settlement agreement that we

3

are citing to.

4

In Section 10.3(d), as discussed and as agreed

5

with Maryland, we've added a provision making very clear

6

that nobody who benefits from a release is excused from

7

ongoing compliance with the discovery.

8

always the case.

Again, that was

We just wanted to make it very blunt.

9

And then you will see, Your Honor, in Sections

10

10.6(B) and 10.7(B), the carveout from those third-party

11

releases for the non-opioid excluded claims.

12
13

I believe that covers the entirety of the changes
in the tenth amended plan, Your Honor.

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. VONNEGUT:

16

So I'll turn it over to Mr. Uzzi to

discuss the substance of the non-opioid excluded claims.

17

THE COURT:

18

MR. UZZI:

19

Okay.

Milbank.

Okay.

That's fine.

Your Honor, it's Gerard Uzzi, from

Can you hear and see me?

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. UZZI:

Yes, I can, thanks.
All right.

Your Honor, I can make a

22

brief presentation if you'd like.

23

go straight to the questions.

24
25

THE COURT:

Otherwise, we could just

It's --

Why don't we go to the questions,

because I think your answers will, in essence, be the

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 20
1

presentation.

2

MR. UZZI:

3

THE COURT:

Okay.
My first one was, I did see the change

4

to the definition of releasing parties, that limits the

5

releasing parties to all holders of claims and strikes

6

causes of action.

7

I think this is probably just stay scriveners

8

error, therefore, because -- or maybe you need to explain it

9

to me, when you actually turn to 10.6(B) and 10.7(B).

10

think...

11

just confirm one point first...

12

Well, let me just go back to one point.

But I

Let me

Yeah.

Each of those provides for a release of all causes

13

of action.

14

the back door; the change that you all made to the

15

definition of releasing parties isn't coming in the back

16

door.

17

up, I guess, is it says in (b), releases by non-debtors.

18

And...

I don't think so, but I guess where it really comes

19
20

And I want to make sure that it's not coming in

MR. UZZI:

Your Honor, let me explain what we were

trying to do, and I think it may answer the question.

21

THE COURT:

Well, maybe it's just the title.

22

Maybe it should say releases by non-debtor releasing

23

parties, and maybe that gets you there.

24

Right?

MR. UZZI:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That is

correct.

6

THE COURT:

It's not a backdoor way to say that in

10.7(B), the release is expanded beyond releasing parties to

8

other non-debtors.

9

MR. UZZI:

10

That is correct, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

Okay.

So maybe it's just the heading

11

that confused me.

also may be a drafting point.

13

was a pretty carefully drafted set of defined terms and

MR. UZZI:

Your Honor, that's used throughout the

21

THE COURT:

All right.

Okay.

Because, again, it

22

includes -- the definition of protected parties includes

23

each of the Debtors' related parties, which is a defined

term, related parties.

The defined term, related parties, I believe was

intended to be narrowed as far as the shareholder release is

11

concerned -- the release of the shareholding settling

parties.

13

14

sales reps, medical liaisons --

15

The defined term, related parties, includes, for

MR. VONNEGUT:

Yes.

Your Honor, I can help with

16

this one.

The defined term, related parties, isn't actually

17

used for the releases of the shareholders.

18

shareholders is shareholder released parties.

19

where what we did was we put attorneys, independent

20

contractors, et cetera, in their own clause, and then made

clear in the third-party release that those shareholder

released parties are not covered by the third-party release.

And again, this is a term

that is picked up in the definition of released parties.

includes each of the Debtors' related parties.

12

MR. VONNEGUT:

That's right.

It

Released parties and

13

shareholder released parties are separate, Your Honor.

14

Released parties are addressed in Section 10.6 and

15

shareholder released parties are addressed in Section 10.7.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

But let's go to -- 10.6(B)

covers releases by releasing parties.

18

includes holders of claims.

MR. VONNEGUT:

THE COURT:

Yes.

So the released parties are released

in 10.B, which I view as a third-party release.

Page 25

see what I'm saying, I think.

2

MR. VONNEGUT:

I do, Your Honor.

We carved out

the shareholder payment parties from released parties.

also included the carveout for non-opioid excluded claims in

Section 10.6(B) and Section 10.7.

10.6(B)?

13

I

Is the intention, then, not to have the

10

12

We

MR. VONNEGUT:

That's correct.

And frankly, maybe

the --

14

THE COURT:

So that --

15

MR. VONNEGUT:

-- simplest way to deal with this

16

is the way we handled co-defendants and just bluntly carve

17

all of them out 10.6(B).

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

All right.

Now, related to

19

that, you have a good -- clearly the most work was done here

20

on 10.7, which is fair, because the focus was on that.

21

have -- if I can find it now -- maybe I lost it.

22

the definition of shareholder released parties, you have a

23

much more narrow list of other entities related to the

24

shareholder released parties that would be covered.

25

know, as Mr. Uzzi mentioned the other day, it grammatically

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

You

Yeah.

In

You

516-608-2400

carved out subcontractors, et cetera.

That still exists in

2

the related parties definition, which again was, I think,

3

originally meant to just be applicable to the shareholders

4

as well.

5

But there's stuff in it now that I don't really

6

think fits for the other released parties, including, you

7

know, trusts, independent contractors, subcontractors.

8

just not sure why those people are being covered anymore.

9

think that's a holdover.

10

MR. VONNEGUT:

I'm

Those were intended to be, as Your

11

Honor mentioned yesterday, ways of preventing back door

12

assertion of claims that are really against the Debtor.

13

THE COURT:

All right.

Well, I guess it really

14

comes back to, again, making it clear that the shareholder

15

released parties are not part of 10.6(B).

16
17

MR. VONNEGUT:

I

I think that's the solution, Your

Honor --

18

THE COURT:

Okay.

19

MR. VONNEGUT:

-- is to just have a very firm

20

brick wall between shareholder released parties and other

21

released parties.

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

Now, you have in the

23

shareholder released parties definition a sentence towards

24

the end that says, "For purposes of this definition of

25

shareholder released parties, the phrase solely in their

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 27
1

respective capacities as such, means with respect to a

2

person solely to the extent that,", and then you have X and

3

Y.

4

related parties as well.

I think that would be useful to put in the definition of

5

MR. VONNEGUT:

6

THE COURT:

Sure.

Because there's -- I mean, otherwise,

7

you have it in one place or the other and people are going

8

to say, well, it must be broader than all related parties,

9

because you don't say it there.

10

Lastly -- and this was probably very far from

11

people's minds when they were focusing on this -- the Debtor

12

release in 10.6(A) releases causes of action, which is

13

broadly defined, including against officers and employees.

14

We've carefully put in the compensation orders

15

that there's a disgorgement obligation.

16

be any doubt that that's not being released, that

17

disgorgement obligation.

18

MR. VONNEGUT:

19

THE COURT:

And there shouldn't

And I think -Understood, Your Honor.

I think, arguably, there might be if

20

you have this here the way it is.

21

MR. VONNEGUT:

22

THE COURT:

We can clarify that.

All right.

Okay.

So those are my

23

questions and comments.

24

Fogelman and perhaps one or two other parties may want to

25

address this markup, again, just specifically with respect

212-267-6868

I think -- well, I think Mr.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

Page 28

to the language and what it does and doesn't do.

2

happy to hear from them.

3

MR. FOGELMAN:

And I'm

Good morning, Your Honor.

This is

4

Larry Fogelman on behalf of the United States.

5

a few concerns to raise about the language.

6

clear, we're reserving all of our objections raised in our

7

brief but --

8

THE COURT:

9

MR. FOGELMAN:

We did have

But, to be

Right.
-- we raised these points in an

10

effort to assist to the extent the Court is trying to

11

implement directions we understood it to give the other day.

12

THE COURT:

That's right.

13

MR. FOGELMAN:

14

So our first comment relates to the definition of

Thank you, Your Honor.

15

non-opioid excluded claims and, specifically, most

16

concerning (iii).

17

saying yesterday is that to the extent that there's a

18

concern about potential derivative liability, that that's

19

already addressed under the Debtor's release and that there

20

doesn't necessarily need to be any language.

21

other words, (iii) could be struck in its entirety because

22

anything derivative would be picked up from the Debtor's

23

release.

24
25

What we understood Your Honor to be

Like so in

You know, and the concern we have of (iii) is that
it could potentially be read to suggest that if the

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 29
1

shareholder release parties took actions while on the board,

2

that may lead to their direct liability, not derivative

3

liability but direct liability, that somehow because that

4

action was done while they were on the board or working with

5

the company, that that is now getting a release under this

6

(iii).

7

So we would submit the simplest way to deal with

8

it is to just strike (iii).

To the extent that there's any

9

need for it at all, it should use the word "derivative

10

liability" expressly like -- or something simple like (iii)

11

could be something like it's solely based on derivative

12

liability of the Debtors if that's even necessary at all.

13

But otherwise, we're just concerned that all of this

14

language here may create the implication that there is a

15

release for direct claims against the shareholder release

16

parties.

17
18

That's point one.

I'm happy to move on unless

Your Honor wants to engage about this point first.

19

THE COURT:

20

MAN:

21

THE COURT:

Well, let's just stop on point one.

Your Honor, it's (indiscernible).
No, I'm just reading the language.

I

22

think -- I don't really see how (iii)(a) through (c) hurts.

23

It would -- I think you're probably right.

24

right that it's language that ensures that derivative

25

liability is not being asserted since the Debtors are

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

I think you are

516-608-2400

Page 30
1

settling it.

2

that -- so that third parties know that, too.

3

But I don't see how it hurts to make it clear

MR. FOGELMAN:

If Your Honor wants to make it

4

clear, would it not be simpler just to say in (iii) it's

5

solely based on derivative liability of the Debtors?

6
7

THE COURT:

four opinions to address in the Manville and Quigley cases.

8
9

Well, but that took the Second Circuit

MR. HUEBNER:

Yeah.

And, Your Honor, for the

record, that is what was guiding.

You know, once you start

10

getting into standards like "solely" and "like," we think

11

this strikes the right balance and we're with Your Honor on

12

this point.

13

thought to try to cue perfectly to what we thought the Court

14

was saying.

15

And we actually obviously all gave it a lot of

THE COURT:

I mean I think the courts are still

16

discussing what derivative liability means in this context.

17

But this uses the language from 524, which is, you know, I

18

think the clearest guide since there's been the most

19

commentary on it.

20

MR. FOGELMAN:

If the concept, Your Honor, is that

21

derivative liability is what's excluded here, you know, no

22

matter how the courts interpret it, wouldn't the phrase

23

"derivative liability" cover all the scenarios defined by

24

the Court?

25

up with language that -- you know, I mean, frankly, who

212-267-6868

Here, there's an attempt based on 524(g) to come

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 31
1

knows how that language bears under the Second Circuit cases

2

that Your Honor alluded to.

3

But if the concept is simply derivative liability,

4

you know, is what the exclusive is for, I think if it simply

5

says that, rather than trying to enumerate what that means,

6

that would be the more --

7

THE COURT:

Well, I don't mind it saying "does not

8

allege derivative liability including without limitation"

9

and then going through (a) through (c).

10

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, with all due respect to

11

Mr. Fogelman, he's in essence repeated the same request

12

three times and the Court has addressed the view three

13

times.

14

to be unkind but he keeps saying can we do this instead, and

15

the Court just keeps saying no and he just keeps asking it

16

again without new analysis or reasoning.

17
18

I think if there are other points, just I don't mean

This is not a markup session in a conference room.
This is a court of law.

19

THE COURT:

Again, I understand his main point.

20

The point was that this wouldn't be a back door.

21

mind saying "derivative liability including without

22

limitation" and then listing those three categories (a)

23

through (c).

24

MR. HUEBNER:

25

MR. FOGELMAN:

212-267-6868

So I don't

Thank you, Your Honor.

Thank you.

Veritext Legal Solutions

Page 32
1

The second point we had, Your Honor, relates to

2

the 11.1(E) language that's incorporated into non-opioid

3

excluded claims.

4

is that let's say a state has a clearly (indiscernible)

5

state cause of action under a state consumer (indiscernible)

6

against the Debtors for clearly non-opioid conduct.

7

And specifically, Your Honor, the concern

I don't think this Court would have jurisdiction

8

to require California or whatever state would bring this

9

claim, for example, to come into court and have to make a

10

showing on an evidentiary record that the claim is

11

colorable.

12

achieved by putting the burden on the shareholder release

13

parties if they want to claim that a lawsuit is somehow a

14

violation of this, for that party to have the burden to make

15

a showing that the complaint somehow is an end run or is

16

really, you know, an opioid claim dressed up (indiscernible)

17

with clothing rather than having a state which might not

18

even be subject to this Court's jurisdiction have to go into

19

this Court and make an evidentiary showing that its claim is

20

colorable.

21

It would -- you know, the point could be best

THE COURT:

Well, that's a fair point.

You know,

22

this is -- I -- the colorable point I didn't understand.

23

It's really "is within the definition of."

24

gatekeeping function I have here is as to the injunction,

25

not as to whether it's colorable.

212-267-6868

The only

So I agree with that

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 33
1

point.

2

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, one I think overall

3

thing that does bear mention because it's actually important

4

and there's a little bit of a bizarre quality to all of

5

these colloquies.

6

refused and would not agree to be part of NOAT and would not

7

agree to take -- give me a minute, Your Honor, because it's

8

actually important.

9
10

Mr. Fogelman and the United States

And the United States of America has carved out
entirely from every one of these releases.

11

THE COURT:

I understand all of that.

I get that

12

Mr. Huebner, but I had actually forgotten to mention this

13

point.

14

and "is within the definition."

15

because the purpose of this is to, in essence, protect the

16

injunction.

17

really -- if I determine that it's not enjoined, then really

18

whether it's colorable or not is for another court.

19

I didn't understand why the phrase "is colorable"
I get the definition part

But the "is colorable," I didn't -- that's

MR. HUEBNER:

Correct, Your Honor.

20

didn't actually make the point yet.

21

second, I promise I'm just about done.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. HUEBNER:

I just -- I

If you give me one more

Okay.
The reason the states have a

24

different view on these things and have signed off on many

25

of these things is because, unlike Mr. Fogelman, it is their

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 34
1

entity that will bear all the costs of dealing with this.

2

And so I just want to note because it's important the people

3

who actually -- whose claims we're talking about and whose

4

MDT has to pay for all this are not objecting.

5

person who has not agreed to be part of any of this and

6

bears no cost is trying to change the releases that the

7

affected state governmental entities have agreed to.

8
9
10

So there are reasons why many of us agreed on this
language that are relevant to maximizing value for the
states.

2

THE COURT:

3

MR. UZZI:

That's fair.
Your Honor, Gerard Uzzi of Milbank.

4

Just what we were trying to -- what we were attempting to

5

accomplish with the colorable language is making sure the

6

gatekeeper function was a true gatekeeping function, and

7

that's it.

8

shouldn't be just bare allegations that if it's going to be

9

carved out here, there should be something more than a

And the compare and contrast is that it

10

simple bare allegation that allows parties to bring

11

lawsuits.

12

that there's something real.

13

And that's all we were trying to say by colorable

THE COURT:

Well, I understand that, but I think

14

you have other devices on that point like Rule 11 and state

15

law equivalents.

16

MR. FOGELMAN:

And, you know, while Mr. Huebner

17

may disagree with this point, shouldn't it also be the

18

burden of the shareholder release parties to make that

19

showing rather than having --

20

THE COURT:

No, I don't think

21

MR. FOGELMAN:

THE COURT:

so.

-- states who might not --

I don't think so.

If someone's

23

violating an injunction, I'm not -- I think it's fine this

way.

I think -- I don't think that should be changed.

Okay.

Your Honor, I have nothing

13

further except just to reiterate I think Your Honor's point

14

under 10.6(B) was a very good one and an important one that,

15

you know, to the extent there's a McKinsey out there who

16

worked with the Debtors, they shouldn't be getting a release

17

through the definition of related parties (indiscernible)

18

through the definition of released parties in 10.6(B).

19

THE COURT:

20

MR. ECKSTEIN:

21

one moment?

Okay.
Your Honor, can I just step in for

This is Ken Eckstein from Kramer Levin?

22

THE COURT:

Sure.

MR. ECKSTEIN:

Thank you.

I just didn't want my

days as we have throughout.

2

the recent expansion or narrowing, let's say, of the release

3

with respect to non-opioid claims is a significant issue to

4

the governmental entities and will be very important to the

5

MDT because the MDT has committed in the settlement

6

agreement and in the plan to support the enforceability of

7

the release and has agreed to do so at its own expense.

8
9

But as Mr. Huebner indicated,

And that was something that we were comfortable
agreeing to at a point in time when the release was viewed

10

as being more comprehensive.

11

becomes any less clearer or any more murky and to the extent

12

there is going to be the risk of any greater post-effective

13

date jocking for seeing if claims can be created post-

14

effective date that potentially flip through very

15

complicated releases, we are concerned about finding

16

ourselves sort of as the MDT on behalf of the beneficiaries

of the plan.

18

public creditors who will be receiving funds through the

19

MDT.

20

But to the extent this release

22

significant obligations that we've committed to.

23

directly concerned about making sure that wherever we come

24

to rest, that this release is as clear as possible and that

25

there is little ambiguity because we're not looking to

can avoid it.

3

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, I mean that was -- that's

4

why I think this was in some sense a drafting session

5

because I was trying to make sure there wasn't ambiguity.

6

And I do understand --

7

MR. FOGELMAN:

8

THE COURT:

9

I do understand the concern that both

you and Mr. Huebner raised on that point.

10
11

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Your Honor, Paul Schwartzberg

from the U.S. Trustee's Office.

12

THE COURT:

Yes.

13

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Your Honor, I just raised to

14

bring up two points, but first clear these are in additional

15

to our objection and our oral argument.

16

THE COURT:

Right.

17

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

The first is that we do adopt

18

the comments by the U.S. Attorneys Office.

19

Your Honor, in regard to the releasing parties where they

20

have the parenthetical, the new definition of releasing

21

parties where they have the parenthetical, at the end where

22

it says "under this plan or treated otherwise," well,

23

"otherwise" is -- we believe is vague and maybe once again

24

trying to get in people or entities that may not be

25

creditors of this case.

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And, second,

516-608-2400

Page 39
1

And I think plan or otherwise is not in the

2

definition of claim under 101.

3

THE COURT:

4

MAN:

5

THE COURT:

But a claim is a defined term.

That's correct, Your Honor.
This is a point that the Seventh

6

Circuit actually disagrees with you on as a fundamental

7

point, so I would take this as a win, Mr. Schwartzberg.

8

might well have lost on this point if they hadn't made this

9

concession.

10

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

11

THE COURT:

12

You

Thank you, Your Honor.

At least the Seventh Circuit thinks so

in their most recent case on this issue, Ingersoll.

13

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

14

MR. EDMUNDS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, Brian Edmunds for the

15

State of Maryland and I think in all likelihood for the

16

other objecting states, I just want to note if I can with

17

respect to the matter I raised on Wednesday regarding the

18

10.6(B) releases that while it does appear that Debtors have

19

taken steps to clarify them and to, you know, ensure that

20

the released party -- that the undiscovered McKinsey is

21

excluded from the releases, I have not had time that the

22

plan filed at 11 last night to discuss with other states

23

these issues in full and to fully trace out what the changes

24

have been.

25

And so, you know, I agree for I'm sure completely

Page 40
1

different reasons than Mr. Eckstein agrees that we need to

2

be clear and have clear language on the releases.

3

just wanted to say that while I think this is a step in the

4

right direction, it may be that after fully reviewing this,

5

states have a different view of whether this reaches the

6

level of clarity that we need.

7

And I

And so I'd ask the Court to allow, you know, us

8

the additional time to discuss and comment on the plan that

9

we really didn't understand was being filed at 11 last

10

night.

11

The other thing is the same would go for the

12

shareholder related releases and the changes made there.

13

And I would adopt what Mr. Fogelman has said for the states.

14

But, again, we need to be precise here.

15

is pretty important to how the states' police powers get

16

discharged in the future.

17

closer look than we've been able to at this point.

And I think we're going to take a

those comments briefly, if I may.

MR. VONNEGUT:

I think that this

That's fine.

comments received from Mr. Edmunds other than we want the

I would note the plan with this release

releases deleted.

We asked repeatedly whether there were

2

other revisions to the releases that would be helpful to

3

narrow them.

4

This week I've had several conversations and,

5

frankly, I've continued to ask repeatedly if you have a

6

markup, if you want words changed, please tell us.

7

getting to be a little bit much when we show up at a hearing

8

which was originally scheduled to be the ruling on

9

confirmation to simply be told again we don't think it's

10

It's

clear enough.

11

If parties do not think the releases are clear

12

enough at this stage in the game, we really need to know

13

why.

14

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, if I could respond.

I

15

mean with all due respect to Mr. Vonnegut, he doesn't quite

16

know the discussions that have happened and that have

17

occurred and is not fully disclosing the level of off-the-

18

record communication between the states and the Debtors with

respect to these releases.

get the job done, which is to make sure that this new

22

language filed at 11 last night --

23

THE COURT:

And I don't think we need to
I think we just need to

Look, that's fair, Mr. Edmunds.

But I

24

think there's -- it appears to me subject to the cleanup

25

questions that I had raised that the Debtor release is with

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 42
1

respect to claims that the Debtors have and that the

2

releasing parties would have, one that as far as non-opioid

3

claims is I think as cabined as one can make it to a true

4

Debtor claim release.

5

And if there's any doubt about that, I think you

6

just have to read the Quigley case and Judge Chan's

7

interpretation of it in her 2019 W.R. Grace opinion.

8

far as the third-party release of the shareholders is

9

concerned, I think it is clear too that except for making

And as

10

clear again that it's cabined as to non-opioid claims by the

11

definition of the excluded non-opioid claims, as is the

12

other release.

13

So I think we're -- at this point, subject to the

14

cleanup, and I think it is just true cleanup that we've

15

discussed, is clear.

16

isn’t, I guess you can let me know Monday or Tuesday -- no,

Monday, not Tuesday.

(indiscernible).

2

MR. HUEBNER:

So, Your Honor, two quick things

3

from the Debtors' side that I think are quite important to

4

note.

5

Mr. Schwartzberg's point, just very quickly, because I think

6

the world should understand the evolution and it will take

7

30 seconds and then I have one other point, then I'm done.

First of all, since we didn't have any colloquy on

8
9

This provision with the parenthetical after claims
is what began as the "any other person" language that the

10

U.S. Trustee and the DOJ have a lot of difficulty with.

11

changed it to "causes of action" and took out "any other

12

person" several rounds ago, which we actually believed until

13

the closing 20 seconds of Wednesday's hearing solved

14

everybody's problems.

15

appropriately stood up and said, "For the record, I'm still

16

not (indiscernible) because of causes of action.”

17

We

Mr. Schwartzberg absolutely

We've now deleted causes of action and put in only

18

a parenthetical not applying a defined term.

19

and moved and moved, and I believe they have prevailed in --

20

in -- in -- in -- you know -- in -- in -- in

21

that's a lot to say about that.

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. HUEBNER:

This has moved

-- and I think

Okay.
With respect to Mr. Edmund's point,

24

I think it's critically important that the record be clear

25

and, Your Honor, we understand and Mr. Edmunds, like many of

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 44
1

the other AG's are working around the clock on this, you

2

know, and we respect that deeply, but I just wanted the

3

record to bear, when he says working with the states, he

4

means a very small number of objecting states.

5

overwhelming majority of states were part of this draft --

THE COURT:

MR. HUEBNER:

saying the states --

No, it's -- it's -- it's the objecting

states.

12

The

MR. HUEBNER:

(Indiscernible) it's a very small

number of states.

13

THE COURT:

14

MR. HUEBNER:

I understand.
And as long as the record is privy

15

the article saying the states are objecting to the releases,

16

sometimes, as you heard on Wednesday, oh it's one of them,

17

sometimes it's three of them, sometimes it's eight of them,

18

but it's never 48 of them who are on the other side.

19

just wanted to make that clear.

20

THE COURT:

21

MR. HUEBNER:

22

THE COURT:

23

MR. HUEBNER:

There's --

It's a --- no confusion in anybody's mind.
All right.
So with that, Your Honor, I think

24

the releases are behind us.

25

along with the Court's, you know, kind of electron

212-267-6868

And I

If we missed anything else,

2

understand each other now, about what the business deal is,

3

hopefully there is nothing else, given the Court's tape

4

flags and post-it's and highlights, but (indiscernible) at

5

least from the debtor's perspective, these releases have

6

been radically, radically narrowed in the last ten days as

7

to parties and scope, and hopefully that gives many parties

8

a very different view of what is being paid for and what is

9

being consensually given by the creditors and stakeholders

10

I think we all

of the case.

11

THE COURT:

Okay.

Very well, thank you all.

It

12

would be helpful if I got these revisions by Tuesday, in

13

anticipation of a ruling on Wednesday morning.

14

MR. EDMUNDS:

15

THE COURT:

Of course, Your Honor.
And I -- I -- I may sound like a

16

record with a scratch in it, but it would also be, I think,

17

a real service to millions, if not tens of millions of

18

people, if the objecting states or some subset of them, were

19

able to resolve their differences with the Sackler's.

20

benefit of a lengthy hearing like is, is that the evidence

21

does come out to a great extent, and there will be a ruling

22

on this that goes through the evidence.

23

for either side just to take rhetorical positions in the

24

future.

25

One

That makes it hard

A ruling also makes it very hard to settle

thereafter.

So the parties basically are left with a choice

2

of resolving their differences now or taking the time,

3

primarily, but also spending the money to fight thereafter.

4

One way or another, either on appeal or in connection with

5

some other form of bankruptcy process.

is crystal clear from the record of the trial, on the

confirmation hearing, is that time is no one's friend.

by that, I really mean, the people who would benefit

immeasurably from implementing what all of the states have

agreed to, as well as, frankly, all of the other

both sides, they're very talented lawyers.

risks they face.

16

realistic about those risks, and just a function of these

17

extra couple of days gives you the opportunity to address

18

them without running the risk of substantial delay of

19

implementing a plan that, at least as far as it's operative

20

effects, is something that I have, I believe, perhaps with

21

the exception of the remaining portion, if there is one of

22

West Virginia's objection, 100% consensus on.

Why don't I take the -- the so called MDT's

have just a -- a fundamental question.

the plan, and it's definition of co-defendant claim, which

4

includes any claim to any MDT insurance policy, or attempt

5

to recover from any MDT insurance policy, and the treatment

6

of Class 14, which is the co-defendant claims.

7

clear to me that to the extent that a co-defendant has a

8

claim, whether it is a named insured or co-insured or not,

9

it will not have any interest in the MDT trust or the MDT

10

insurance, under this plan.

13

THE COURT:

Okay.

Even it -- even if, and it's

14

not clear from the exhibits whether this is the case, it's

actually a named insured or co-insured?

16

MR. GLEIT:

We, there are a few insurance policies

that are in -- in the record and I can give you either a

18

list of them or not, but they're -- well, they're blanket

19

endorsements and they're endorsed -- that they are

additional insureds and do not have any greater rights than

21

an additional insured in any of the debtor's policies.

22

THE COURT:

All right.

23

MR. GLEIT:

So they're not a direct named party,

their -- their right is as an additional insured based upon

whatever contracts they have with the debtors.

MR. GLEIT:

Understood, Your Honor, may I respond?

2

THE COURT:

Sure.

3

MR. GLEIT:

A few things.

We worked on the

4

stipulation with the so called, DMP's which highlighted the

5

insurance requests in their contracts, which said -- take

6

for an example, Walgreen's would be named as an additional

7

insured under a debtor's policy.

8

I could either send it by separate letter or I could read it

9

into the record, the insurance policies that are part of the

And we -- and I --

10

evidentiary record, including the endorsements, which would

11

handle the DMP group, but our argument is based on the

Manvel case, that their rights, as additional insureds, and

I think it's Page 92, are merely derivative of the debtors -

-

MR. GLEIT:

You're correct, Your Honor, and that's

3

why it's so -- the way, when I read my statement on Monday,

4

was, we have reached an agreement on the DMP's for those --

5

for their treatment under the plan, where they reserved some

6

claims and rights, but when it comes to insurance, they're

7

resting on their papers and we're asking you to find that

8

the claims are not derivative, and if they -- I mean that

they are derivative and assuming they are derivative, they

What we agreed was that with regard to -- we

That's the

10

objection we preserved.

We agreed to rest on our briefs.

11

The record contains a stipulation showing the contractual

12

provision for those distributors and pharmacies who have

13

these provisions, where the debtor was required to name this

14

as an additional insured, and the policies are part of the

15

record, then they contain the language that would indicate

16

what the debtor did to effectuate that right.

17

the issue before, Your Honor, is if we have direct rights

18

that live with the decision, we have determined we have

19

derivative rights as counsel argues, that yields a different

decision.

as far as the coverage issue is concerned -- I think I've

4

MR. ECKSTEIN:

So, but

I think your point is clear, Your

5

Honor, but I think Your Honor appreciates from a slant

6

standpoint and from a settlement standpoint, the MDT is

7

expecting to utilize the proceeds of insurance for the

8

benefit of the abatement funds and the creditors have relied

9

very directly on the insurance.

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. ECKSTEIN:

12

Well, that's true.
And I think what we want to avoid

is competition with the insurance.

13

THE COURT:

That -- I understand that, but if they

14

actually have a property right in the insurance that they

15

can enforce, I think that was a vain hope because they're

some more discussions because we think that they are getting

23

very significant benefits under the plan.

THE COURT:

Okay.

Very well.

All right.

Then

2

the other point I had was a whole different set of --

3

involved a whole different set of lawyers, which is --

4

pertains to the U.S. Trustee's objection to certain aspects

5

of the plan treatment of fee claims.

6

here about the defined term "professional fee claims" and

7

the incorporated term "professional persons", but instead

8

Section 5.8, which, based on the evidence before me, was a

9

carefully and heavily negotiated set of provisions to deal

10

primarily with what appear to me to be pre-petition claims

11

against the Debtors' estates, but some post-petition claims.

12

And I have testimony generally as to the

everything else.

18

were careful to note last time in your responding to my

19

questions on this set of issues, I'm not assuming that

20

you're waiving all your other arguments.

And I -- and that's all I really want to

And I didn't -- do I have Mr. Schwartzberg

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

23

THE COURT:

Yes.

Good.

And I'm -- as you

I just really

Yes, Your Honor.

And that goes for everyone else too.

24

Assume for the moment, and I'm not binding anyone to this

25

assumption because I know there are arguments that would

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 61
1

render the assumption irrelevant.

2

that one concludes that 1129(a)(4) would apply to the

3

payments contemplated, albeit not as an administrative

4

expense, but just contemplated by Section 5.8 of the plan.

5

But assume for the moment

And assume for the moment that there's ample

6

testimony that where 5.8 covers what would be a contingency

7

fee or spelled out in terms of a percent fee, and the

8

evidence makes it clear that those fees are reasonable in

9

the marketplace and negotiated down as part of the overall

10

settlement with an increase in the settlement to pay for

11

them.

So I'm asking you to assume all that.

12

There are a couple of categories of fees that are

13

not covered by a percent for a frankly contingency fee type

14

mechanism.

15

5.08(g) and the public schools costs and expenses, I think,

16

maybe not, in 4.08(h).

17

the case of the PI Claimant costs both for the Ad Hoc Group

18

of Individual Victims and the NAS Committee in connection

19

with the Chapter 11 cases determine or presented based on

20

the hourly rates of those counts.

21

They are the PI Claimant costs and expenses in

And as far as the public schools, there's a

dedicated amount that I think also is going to be based, or

at least evaluated as far as reasonableness is concerned

based on an hourly rate.

-- applying to the technical way in

which the distributions are structured.

MR. SHORE:

consequence of a 503(b) application is that if the state

9

MR. SHORE:

10

THE COURT:

11

MR. SHORE:

On 1129(a)(4), the distinction here is

12

that the disclosures were made to the group, and the -- who

13

bears the risk of (indiscernible).

14

that if Your Honor reviewed the invoices of White Case or

15

the invoices of Ask, LLP and Niger who worked throughout

16

this case that you're going to find anything unreasonable.

17

The issue would be who bears the burden of the

18

unreasonableness.

THE COURT:

MR. SHORE:

5

(indiscernible).

7

And so they're going to

Right?

So what ends up happening is with respect to

8

anything that would be unreasonable, the members of the ad

9

hoc group would still have to pay those -- get double-taxed,

10

right?

They don't get their contingency fee reimbursed.

11

They have to pay those fees, and the 95 percent of other

12

creditors who voted in favor of this get relief from that,

13

which is just an allocation of the risk there that people

14

have accepted in the context of the plan.

15

So that -- that's -- and I think 1129(8)(4) argued

16

that the trust which is receiving a distribution from the

17

master distribution trust is really not receiving property

18

of the Debtor directly.

19

that it's a form over substance matter.

20

is there is substance to the distinction in the way we've

21

done this.

So it is a -- the argument would be
And what I'm saying

Because otherwise, those fees get spread out

23

THE COURT:

Well, that's if it -- if 503 applies.

24

MR. SHORE:

Right, but even if -- the way this is

structured that it was put through, the other way to do it

would be to put the fees up at the MVT and then the free-

rider problem is spread differently, as opposed to the fees

3

getting inserted at the PI trust.

4

THE COURT:

All right.

5

MR. SHORE:

But there is a distinct -- a real

Now --

MR. HUEBNER:

THE COURT:

Yep.
-- I -- just because it says special

it's not covered by UM&M.

$500,000 worked, you know, 20 hours for it, that's not

MR. HUEBNER:

Your Honor, I agree, and I actually

-- if that were the case -So (indiscernible) --- I think I would need --- (indiscernible) --- an 1129(a)(4) application.

I think

20

I may for the 500,000 because that doesn't seem to be tied

necessarily even to hourly rates.

22

MR. HUEBNER:

Yep.

And it may be that combining

23

them into a number and having the contingency lawyers pay

24

the bankruptcy things out of a very reasonable fee is an

25

even easier approach.

212-267-6868

So we -- as steward of the process,

Veritext Legal Solutions

we will chase it down.

2

because I think it's actually very -- I hope it will helpful

3

for 45 seconds zoom out on this because it's important and I

4

think it will give context to the answers both that you got

5

and that you did not get.

6

Your Honor, let me, if I may,

So Your Honor, Mr. Price, as I told you on Monday,

7

as counsel to the UCC, I've counted 30 intra-Creditor and

8

other settlements in the plan of which this is one, and I

9

only counted 14.

Probably had I listed 30, I think somebody

10

would've come and found me and done things to me.

11

stopped at 14.

12

So I

As I think I made clear, sometimes the Debtors

13

were deeply involved in those.

Sometimes they were utterly

14

not involved at all, and they were told this is the deal we

15

have reached, put it in the plan.

16

it.

17

came up to us, we were flummoxed because essentially we were

18

told the states are refusing to allow the amount of

19

attorneys' fees negotiated for between private parties and

20

their creditors.

Sometimes we facilitate

Sometimes we actually mediated.

21

When this attorney fee

And some states are refusing to allow other states

22

to be paid with their contingency fee contracts required.

23

And we said we're confused, and they said, well, we're not

24

just creditors, we're states, and we want to ensure that as

25

much money as humanly possible goes to abatement and less

evidence makes clear they dramatically by hundreds of

millions of dollars lowered the attorney's fees otherwise

get to the punchline, and I'm sorry for that.

case, the Debtor's Estate would be directed to just send the

17

money to the Claimants and the lawyers would just scoop

18

whatever it is their contracts say and we know it would be

much, much higher than this.

20

substantially limits the fees and that's the overall

21

context.

22

certainly not objecting because he's trying to take 800

23

million dollars away from victims and instead give it back

to lawyers who have conceded it to their clients.

So I'm confident we will figure it out.

again, it's important that it be clear to everybody.

context of 5.8 is taking hundreds of millions of dollars

away from lawyers who had contracted for those amounts and

instead makes sure that their clients get it.

5

was one of the very many intercreditor public policy

6

settlements embedded in the plan.

7

The

And so this

And, you know, it brings me to my final point,

8

which is on many levels, I wish I had never said one word at

9

this confirmation hearing because it would have actually

10

been a truer representation of this plan if the

11

representatives of the tort victims had themselves done the

12

argument as to why this settlement is in everyone's best

13

interest and the representatives of the states had made oral

14

argument about how they insisted that hundreds of millions

15

of dollars be transferred from lawyers to victims.

16

Creditors Committee should have testified orally, not just

17

in their awesome brief and made argument about how the

18

Iridium standard is satisfied.

19

The

So on some level, the fact that the Debtors'

20

counsel in our many meetings kept getting allocated all the

21

oral arguments in some ways cast a misimpression.

22

not the Debtors' plan; it's everyone's plan.

23

victims' plan and the states' plan and the PIs plan, and the

24

hospitals' plan, and the tribes' plan.

2

the victims for the victims, supported by the victims and

3

this attorney fee thing, with which I will close, is a

4

tremendous public policy win for the victims that is cloaked

5

in lawyer language and 5.8(Q)(h)(1)(i), but it's important

6

that people understand this was public servants hammering on

7

lawyers to take 10 percent and 12 percent and 14 percent

8

instead of 20 or 30 or 40.

9

we believe that 5.8 is defensible and why analytically --

10

and this is in the briefs -- it's not at all obvious that

11

1129(a)(4) applies because it wouldn't have applied in any

12

other case but for the insistence that the fees be lowered.

13

Otherwise, the Claimant Representatives would have just

14

gotten the money and they would have just scooped a much

15

larger amount as their contracts contemplated.

16

It's not Purdue's plan.

It's the plan of

And I hope that helps inform why

So, Your Honor, I just wanted to frame it because

17

it's just a public, important case.

18

that it is helpful and I have nothing further.

THE COURT:

Okay.

I hope, I just hope

Well, I think that was largely

20

for perhaps the public because I think you-all can tell from

21

my questions that all of what you said came through with

this regard to this provision in the parties' briefs and the

23

evidence presented in the declarations with the two

24

exceptions that I was addressing because, you know, I don't

4

So I also think they're being paid on

I've seen their counsel.

They've been responsible

6

notwithstanding the arguments that have been made, that

7

technically 1129(a)(4) doesn't apply, that there should be a

8

mechanism to address the reasonableness of these two

9

categories that hasn't really been addressed in the evidence

10

for far.

11

MR. HUEBNER:

Understood.

As I said, we will get

to the schools as soon as this hearing is over and figure

out what the facts are to get the Court hopefully quite

that he seems, he believes most appropriate.

Page 74

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

What we

2

believed it boiled down to was transparency and oversight.

3

Victims' monies being used to pay attorney fees and we

4

appreciate and are happy that they are being less, but we

5

believe there should be oversight and transparency of those

6

fees so that when the money gets paid, victims know where

7

it's going and how much is being paid.

THE COURT:

Well, I think it spells out and I have

uncontested affidavits on every category of fee here, I

believe, except for the PI claimant costs and expenses in

transparency.

13

So frankly, I think I have

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

And, if I may, Your Honor, it's

not a question with respect to the PI Trustee, there will be

transparency with respect to money coming in and money out.

briefly on behalf of NAS Committee and with respect to our

relatively small portion of the PI Trust, I would submit

10

that the declaration does support the war that we are

11

getting paid on and perhaps to be carved out of that, but

12

understand that Your Honor may feel different.

13

THE COURT:

It supports -- look, you group has

14

been very active in the case and frankly I think if they

15

wanted to, could prevail on a substantial contribution, 503

16

application, but they decided that they're willing to be

17

paid this way instead, which is not as good as a means of

payment than getting the money up front.

It's really just a

The most recent preliminary

expire this Monday, August 30th.

So there will be a small

2

gap in the protection afforded by the preliminary injection

3

and the voluntary injection between Monday and Wednesday,

4

September 1st, which is when the Court intends to issue its

5

ruling on confirmation.

6

We thought through this and we believe the most

7

expedient way to deal with this issue is for the Court to

8

enter a very modest bridge order extending the preliminary

9

injunction through its ruling on confirmation on Wednesday,

10

September 1st.

11

At that time, should the Court confirm the plan,

12

the Debtors intend to request that the Court grant another

13

short bridge extension.

14

confirmation order that would extend the preliminary

15

injunction through the effective date.

16

56(a) of the proposed confirmation order.

17

however, or likely will be that the actual order is not

18

entered on Wednesday if this plan is confirmed on that day

19

and in any event, Bankruptcy Rule 3020(e) provides that the

20

confirmation order is stayed until the expiration of 14 days

21

after entry of the order.

22

bridge order at that time between September 1st and the

23

expiration of the 14-day stay.

24
25

There's a provision in the proposed

That is at Paragraph
It may be,

So the Debtors would seek a

If the Court does not confirm the plan on
Wednesday, the Debtors would also seek short extension to

Page 78
1

assess the appropriateness of seeking a further extension as

2

well as the appropriate contours of form of any such

3

extension.

4

The UCC, the AHC, the MSGE support this request.
So what the Debtors have done is we've prepared a

5

form of order that is virtually identical to the forms of

6

order previous entered by the Court.

7

provision allowing the states to agree to voluntarily abide

8

by the preliminary injunction rather than be formally bound

9

by it.

This includes the

The Debtors assume that the states and other

10

governmental entities, including the plan objectors, will

11

want to continue to voluntarily abide by the order rather

12

than be bound by it.

13

So, in sum, Your Honor, we just need a bridge to

14

get us to Wednesday and then on Wednesday we can see what

15

happens and then see what other further bridge is necessary.

16

THE COURT:

Okay.

17

MR. TROOP:

Your Honor, if I may, it's Andy Troop

think you just ought to run it by Mr. Troop's clients.

11

MR. KAMINETZKY:

due respect, is due to the fact we thought we would get a

13

ruling today.

16

we would imagine.

I understand.
So this is as modest a request as

So.

THE COURT:

Frankly, I'm glad that you remembered

it.

I thought that the injection went through the

19

confirmation hearing, but now recall that you-all tailored

it to be time-sensitive because you were worried -- people

21

were worried it would be unduly delayed, the confirmation

22

hearing, which as you can see --
