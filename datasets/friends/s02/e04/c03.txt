Ross Geller: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Chandler Bing: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Julie: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Chandler Bing: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Ross Geller: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Rachel Green: Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Monica Geller: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Rachel Green: Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
#ALL#: Woah.
Joey Tribbiani: Foxy lady.
Julie: Where you goin'?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Joey Tribbiani: The Ice Capades?
Chandler Bing: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Monica Geller: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Phoebe Buffay: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Ross Geller: Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
Chandler Bing: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
