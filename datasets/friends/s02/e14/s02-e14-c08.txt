Monica Geller: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Ross Geller: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Monica Geller: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Judy Geller: Why?
Monica Geller: Because they made me.
Judy Geller: You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Ross Geller: Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Monica Geller: In the bank.
Ross Geller: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Monica Geller: Anything larger back there?
