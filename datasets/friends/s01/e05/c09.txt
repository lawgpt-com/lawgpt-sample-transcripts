Joey Tribbiani: So, you and Angela, huh?
Bob: Yep. Pretty much.
Joey Tribbiani: You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Bob: Huh, I never really noticed.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Bob: Monica, Monica is great.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
