Joey Tribbiani: Hey, I'm back!
The Casting Director: Hi-hi Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
The Casting Director: Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
The Casting Director: Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Joey Tribbiani: And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
The Casting Director: Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow! Sure! That's great!
The Casting Director: Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
The Casting Director: Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
Joey Tribbiani: So...What?
The Casting Director: So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Joey Tribbiani: Yes!
The Casting Director: Okay.
Joey Tribbiani: No. What?
The Casting Director: An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Joey Tribbiani: Barmifsaed?
