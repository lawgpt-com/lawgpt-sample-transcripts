Dean Lipson: Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Ross Geller: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Dean Lipson: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Ross Geller: Oh my God, what happened?
Dean Lipson: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Ross Geller: I can't believe this.
Dean Lipson: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Ross Geller: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Dean Lipson: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
Ross Geller: Zoo dollars?
Dean Lipson: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
