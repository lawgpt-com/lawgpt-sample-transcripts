Ross Geller: Hey, where's Rachel?
Monica Geller: She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Ross Geller: Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica Geller: What? When was this?
Ross Geller: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Ross Geller: Well, it matters to me.
Chandler Bing: Why?
Ross Geller: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler Bing: You kissed her that night too?
Monica Geller: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Chandler Bing: Seriously, where did this happen?
Ross Geller: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Chandler Bing: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross Geller: Mine.
Chandler Bing: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross Geller: No, she was definitely on my bed.
Chandler Bing: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Ross Geller: Well, then who was on my bed?
Monica Geller: OH! Oh, oh!
Ross Geller: NO! No, no!
Monica Geller: YES!
Ross Geller: You were under the pile of coats?
Monica Geller: I was the pile of coats!
Ross Geller: OH MY GOD!
Monica Geller: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross Geller: You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica Geller: You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler Bing: What did I marry into?
