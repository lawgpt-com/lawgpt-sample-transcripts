Joey Tribbiani: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Rachel Green: Well, what would we be doing?
Joey Tribbiani: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Rachel Green: Feel me up?
Joey Tribbiani: In a carriage!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Charlie!
Rachel Green: Hey.
Charlie Wheeler: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Rachel Green: Oh, you bet.
Joey Tribbiani: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Charlie Wheeler: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh. Oh, thanks.
Charlie Wheeler: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Ross Geller: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
Rachel Green: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Ross Geller: Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, actually, that's..
Ross Geller: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Charlie Wheeler: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
Ross Geller: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Ross Geller: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
