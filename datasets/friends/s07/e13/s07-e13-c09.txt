Earl: Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Phoebe Buffay: No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Earl: Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Earl: It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Phoebe Buffay: Chandler?
Earl: I-I'm sorry?
Phoebe Buffay: No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Earl: Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
