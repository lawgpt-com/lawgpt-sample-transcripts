Chandler Bing: Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Joey Tribbiani: My folks.
Chandler Bing: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Chandler Bing: What?!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Chandler Bing: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Joey Tribbiani: Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Chandler Bing: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.

Chandler Bing: All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Joey Tribbiani: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Chandler Bing: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Joey Tribbiani: We've got a box.
