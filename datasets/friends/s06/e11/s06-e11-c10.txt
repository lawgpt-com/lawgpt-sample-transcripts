Rachel Green: ...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Ross Geller: Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Rachel Green: I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Ross Geller: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Ross Geller: Fascinating.
Phoebe Buffay: Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Rachel Green: Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Phoebe Buffay: Ah!
Ross Geller: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Rachel Green: Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Rachel Green: Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Ross Geller: Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Rachel Green: Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Phoebe Buffay: No! I do want to!
Rachel Green: Oh, she does want to.
Ross Geller: She does want to.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
