Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: How was your first day?
Joey Tribbiani: Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Chandler Bing: Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Joey Tribbiani: Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Joey Tribbiani: I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Estelle Leonard: Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Joey Tribbiani: Wow!
Estelle Leonard: The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Estelle Leonard: Uh-oh!
