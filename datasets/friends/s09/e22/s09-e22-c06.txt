Rachel Green: Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Rachel Green: Ok, great!
Rachel Green: Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Phoebe Buffay: I didn't say anything yet!
Rachel Green: Well, get back in there and talk!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Rachel Green: What!?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Rachel Green: Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh! We have a problem.
Rachel Green: Oh! What are we gonna do?
Stranger: Just be honest with her.
Rachel Green: Oh my God!
Stranger: And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Rachel Green: Alright! Enough out of you!
