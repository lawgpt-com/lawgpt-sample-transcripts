Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Phoebe Buffay: Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Chandler Bing: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Phoebe Buffay: No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Chandler Bing: Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Chandler Bing: Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Joey Tribbiani: What do ya say? What do ya say?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Joey Tribbiani: I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
