Ross Geller: I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
The Hot Girl: I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Ross Geller: Nevermind!
The Hot Girl: No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Ross Geller: I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
The Hot Girl: Jen.
Ross Geller: Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Jen: Sure! That would be nice.
Ross Geller: Umm?
Jen: Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Ross Geller: I will give you a call.
