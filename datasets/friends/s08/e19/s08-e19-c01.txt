Rachel Green: Hi!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.
Joey Tribbiani: Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!
Monica Geller: How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah you are baby.
Monica Geller: Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
Rachel Green: So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
Joey Tribbiani: No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Ross Geller: Why'd you say no?
Joey Tribbiani: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Chandler Bing: If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Rachel Green: Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Chandler Bing: Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Rachel Green: Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Joey Tribbiani: Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
Ross Geller: Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
Rachel Green: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
