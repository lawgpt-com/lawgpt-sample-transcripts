Ross Geller: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
Benjamin Hobart: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
Ross Geller: No! Stop!
Benjamin Hobart: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Ross Geller: Really?
Benjamin Hobart: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
Ross Geller: I have to break up with Charlie?
Benjamin Hobart: Hey, you got one right!
Ross Geller: You're crazy.
Benjamin Hobart: Crazy, or... romantic?
Ross Geller: Crazy!
Benjamin Hobart: Ooor...
Ross Geller: Get out!
