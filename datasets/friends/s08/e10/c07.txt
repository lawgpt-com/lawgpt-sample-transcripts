Phoebe Buffay: Oh, there you are Ben!
Ben Geller: Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
Ben Geller: Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
Phoebe Buffay: Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
Ben Geller: I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
Phoebe Buffay: Him you're friends with.
The Teacher: Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
The Teacher: Are you with one of the students?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
The Teacher: Are you one of Ben's mothers?
Phoebe Buffay: I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
The Teacher: Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
The Teacher: I've only met your partner Carol.
Phoebe Buffay: Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
The Teacher: Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben? Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
The Teacher: Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
