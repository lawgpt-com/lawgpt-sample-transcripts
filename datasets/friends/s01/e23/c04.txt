Phoebe Buffay: They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...

Phoebe Buffay: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Monica Geller: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler Bing: You'll get one.
Monica Geller: Oh yeah? When?
Chandler Bing: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Monica Geller: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler Bing: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Monica Geller: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler Bing: No, no, no.
Monica Geller: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Chandler Bing: Uh, uh.
Monica Geller: Well?
Chandler Bing: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!

Rachel Green: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Monica Geller: Did you go home and change?
Rachel Green: Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Monica Geller: No, I haven't seen him.
Rachel Green: Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Chandler Bing: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Rachel Green: Yeah, why?
Chandler Bing: No reason.
