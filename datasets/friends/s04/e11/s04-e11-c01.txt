Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Frank Buffay Jr.: Oh I know!!
Phoebe Buffay: You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Frank Buffay Jr.: 'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
Phoebe Buffay: Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Frank Buffay Jr.: We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Frank Buffay Jr.: Uhh, yeah.
Alice Knight: We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Frank Buffay Jr.: See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Alice Knight: And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Phoebe Buffay: That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
