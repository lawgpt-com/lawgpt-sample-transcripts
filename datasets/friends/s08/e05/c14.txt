Rachel Green: Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?

Ross Geller: Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
Rachel Green: Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.

Ross Geller: Yeah-ha!
Rachel Green: Oh my God.
Ross Geller: I'm sorry about your date.
Rachel Green: Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Ross Geller: Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Rachel Green: Thanks sweetie.
Ross Geller: You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Rachel Green: Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Ross Geller: Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
