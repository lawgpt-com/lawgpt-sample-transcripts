Rachel Green: Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Joanna: Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Rachel Green: Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Joanna: Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Rachel Green: God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Joanna: Really? Well, in that case...
Rachel Green: And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Joanna: That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
Rachel Green: Ohh! That's great!
Joanna: You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Rachel Green: Really?!
Joanna: No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Rachel Green: Well, I, umm...
Joanna: Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
