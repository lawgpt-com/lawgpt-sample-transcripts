Ross Geller: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Monica Geller: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Joey Tribbiani: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Phoebe Buffay: Why not her?
Joey Tribbiani: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Chandler Bing: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Monica Geller: Joey that is horriable.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Joey Tribbiani: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Ross Geller: Hi honey, how did it go?
Rachel Green: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Chandler Bing: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Rachel Green: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Monica Geller: So what happened?
Rachel Green: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Monica Geller: Well, how bout just her mom?
Chandler Bing: Why her mom?
Monica Geller: Cause I already invited her.
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
