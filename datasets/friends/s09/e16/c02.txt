Mike Hannigan: I'm gonna go.
Phoebe Buffay: Why??
Mike Hannigan: I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
Mike Hannigan: I put that tube top on as a joke.
Phoebe Buffay: I want you to stay.
Mike Hannigan: I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..
Phoebe Buffay: Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Mike Hannigan: Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Phoebe Buffay: I'll miss you.
Mike Hannigan: Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
Phoebe Buffay: Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Mike Hannigan: No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
Phoebe Buffay: Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
Mike Hannigan: So we're doing it?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Mike Hannigan: Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay: I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
