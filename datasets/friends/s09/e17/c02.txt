Rachel Green: Hey! How was basketball?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Rachel Green: Oh, no! Who did that?
Joey Tribbiani: Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
Rachel Green: She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Rachel Green: Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Joey Tribbiani: Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Rachel Green: All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Joey Tribbiani: Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
