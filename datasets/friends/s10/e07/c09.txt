Rachel Green: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Ross Geller: SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Rachel Green: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Ross Geller: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
Rachel Green: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
Ross Geller: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Rachel Green: I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Ross Geller: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
Rachel Green: Alright fine. I'll do it.
Ross Geller: Good.
Rachel Green: If you hold a spider.
Ross Geller: WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Rachel Green: IF you hold a spider.
Ross Geller: I know.
