Phoebe Buffay: Oh. Oh.
Rachel Green: Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Rachel Green: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I have a wedgie.
Rachel Green: Okay, that is all you.
Phoebe Buffay: So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Rachel Green: Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Rachel Green: I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Phoebe Buffay: Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Rachel Green: Still in love with?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Rachel Green: I'm not in love with Ross!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Rachel Green: Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
Phoebe Buffay: We thought you knew!
Rachel Green: We?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Rachel Green: You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Rachel Green: Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
