Ross Geller: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?

#ALL#: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Joey Tribbiani: Nope.
Ross Geller: No? What happened, big guy?
Chandler Bing: "Big guy?"
Ross Geller: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Joey Tribbiani: I got fired.
#ALL#: Oh!
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Rachel Green: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Joey Tribbiani: My mom will.
Chandler Bing: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Joey Tribbiani: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Monica Geller: Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Joey Tribbiani: Hard to tell, I was naked.
Phoebe Buffay: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah? That's so nice!

Monica Geller: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
#ALL#: Night.
Rachel Green: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Monica Geller: Uh-huh!
Rachel Green: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Monica Geller: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Ross Geller: She is a kook.
