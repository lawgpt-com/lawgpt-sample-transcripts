Rachel Green: Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
Ross Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Ross Geller: So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Joey Tribbiani: No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Ross Geller: Rach? You wanna come?
Rachel Green: Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
Ross Geller: A date?
Rachel Green: Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Ross Geller: Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
Joey Tribbiani: It's no Ukrainian film.
Rachel Green: Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!
Ross Geller: A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
Joey Tribbiani: I set her up with this actor on my show.
Ross Geller: You set her up?!
Joey Tribbiani: No
Ross Geller: Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
Ross Geller: Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
Ross Geller: A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Joey Tribbiani: Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Ross Geller: Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
