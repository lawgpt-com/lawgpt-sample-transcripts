Rachel Green: Oh wow! Look at this place!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Rachel Green: Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Rachel Green: Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Rachel Green: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Rachel Green: See?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
Rachel Green: You can't, because of the new skylight!
Phoebe Buffay: There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Rachel Green: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Phoebe Buffay: A little bit, yeah.
Rachel Green: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Phoebe Buffay: You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Rachel Green: Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Phoebe Buffay: Are you sure?
Rachel Green: Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh me too.
Rachel Green: I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Phoebe Buffay: No, I do not hear that.
