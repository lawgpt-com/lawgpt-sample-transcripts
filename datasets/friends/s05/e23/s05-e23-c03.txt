Phoebe Buffay: So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Chandler Bing: So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Phoebe Buffay: Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Chandler Bing: Happy plane-aversary.
Monica Geller: Aww! I love you!
Chandler Bing: Can I give you a present now?
Monica Geller: Okay!
Chandler Bing: Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Monica Geller: I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Chandler Bing: How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Monica Geller: Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Chandler Bing: Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Chandler Bing: What-what Richard thing?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no.
Chandler Bing: What Richard thing?
Phoebe Buffay: Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Monica Geller: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Chandler Bing: I'm not mad.
Monica Geller: Really?!
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Monica Geller: Great!
