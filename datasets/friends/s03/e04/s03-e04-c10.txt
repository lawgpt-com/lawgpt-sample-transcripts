Chandler Bing: ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.

Rachel Green: Yeah, it is.
Monica Geller: You know what, everything's gonna be okay.

Chandler Bing: Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Rachel Green: Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Monica Geller: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: Hello!
Monica Geller: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Rachel Green: Yes, and grumpy.
Chandler Bing: What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Rachel Green: He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Chandler Bing: I love you too.
Monica Geller: Aw, it's soo unfair.
