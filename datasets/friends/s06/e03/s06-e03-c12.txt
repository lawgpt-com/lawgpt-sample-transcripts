Ross Geller: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
unknown: nan
Monica Geller: That's very funny!
Chandler Bing: He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Ross Geller: No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Monica Geller: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Ross Geller: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Monica Geller: Yeah, no, me neither.
Ross Geller: Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Monica Geller: You still want to move in together right?
Chandler Bing: Of course!
Monica Geller: Ross didn't scare you?
Chandler Bing: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Monica Geller: Come here, I want to show you something!
Chandler Bing: Okay!

Chandler Bing: Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Monica Geller: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Chandler Bing: Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Monica Geller: Okay!
Chandler Bing: Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Monica Geller: Uh-hmm.
Chandler Bing: Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Monica Geller: Oh my God! I love that!
Chandler Bing: Really?!
Monica Geller: Uh, no!!
