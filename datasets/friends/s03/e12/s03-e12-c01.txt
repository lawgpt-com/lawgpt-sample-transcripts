Rachel Green: Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Rachel Green: Tell him.
Ross Geller: It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Chandler Bing: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Ross Geller: Why?
Chandler Bing: I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Ross Geller: Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Chandler Bing: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Ross Geller: Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Chandler Bing: It must take you forever to find your keys.
Rachel Green: Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Rachel Green: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Ross Geller: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Rachel Green: Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Ross Geller: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Rachel Green: Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Rachel Green: Oh.
Chandler Bing: Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Ross Geller: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Chandler Bing: Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Phoebe Buffay: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Chandler Bing: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
