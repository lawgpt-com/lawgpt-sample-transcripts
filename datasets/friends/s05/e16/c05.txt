Phoebe Buffay: Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
The Smoking Woman: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
The Smoking Woman: Who are you talking too?
Phoebe Buffay: Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
The Smoking Woman: I am not going to apologize to a tree!

The Smoking Woman: I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
