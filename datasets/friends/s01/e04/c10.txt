Rachel Green: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Monica Geller: No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Pizza Guy: Pizza guy!
Rachel Green: Thank God. Food.
Monica Geller: Phoebe?
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Monica Geller: Do you have a plan?
Phoebe Buffay: I don't even have a 'pl'.
Pizza Guy: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
Rachel Green: No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Pizza Guy: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Monica Geller: Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Pizza Guy: Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Monica Geller: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Pizza Guy: Yeah, that sounds about right.
Monica Geller: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Phoebe Buffay: And-and a power tie?
Pizza Guy: No, pretty much just a towel.
Monica Geller: Oh God.
Pizza Guy: So you guys want me to take this back?
Monica Geller: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Rachel Green: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Phoebe Buffay: Big Bird's friend.
Monica Geller: I see pizza!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Rachel Green: Hello? Who are we spying on?
Monica Geller: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Rachel Green: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Monica Geller: Please tell me it's his mother.
Phoebe Buffay: Definitely not his mother.
Monica Geller: Oh, no...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
