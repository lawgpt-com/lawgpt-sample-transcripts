Phoebe Buffay: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Monica Geller: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Phoebe Buffay: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Monica Geller: Oh, well... That had been your window.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Monica Geller: Really? The scientist guy?
Phoebe Buffay: Really? Chandler?
Monica Geller: Continue...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
Monica Geller: Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Monica Geller: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe Buffay: Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Monica Geller: What are you gonna do?
Phoebe Buffay: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Monica Geller: You have to tell David!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
