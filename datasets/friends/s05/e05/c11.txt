Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hi.
Chandler Bing: I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Monica Geller: Yeah, it did.
Chandler Bing: So, I guess this is over.
Monica Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Monica Geller: Why, exactly?
Chandler Bing: Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Monica Geller: Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Chandler Bing: So, this isn't over?
Monica Geller: You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Chandler Bing: Really? Okay. Great!
Monica Geller: Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Chandler Bing: We're in a relationship?
Monica Geller: I'm afraid so.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
