Rachel Green: Hi.
Chandler Bing: Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Rachel Green: Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Chandler Bing: Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Rachel Green: All right fine, I pick you.
Chandler Bing: Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Rachel Green: Oh my...
