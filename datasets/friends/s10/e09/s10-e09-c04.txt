Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Joey Tribbiani: Well...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Joey Tribbiani: Nope.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
Phoebe Buffay: That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
Phoebe Buffay: What?
Joey Tribbiani: ALL FOOD!
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Rachel Green: Hi.
Phoebe Buffay: Thank God you're here. Listen to this!
Rachel Green: what?
Phoebe Buffay: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Rachel Green: Oh! Oh, no!
Phoebe Buffay: What? You know about the plate thing?
Rachel Green: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Phoebe Buffay: You wouldn't let her have a grape?
Rachel Green: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Joey Tribbiani: JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Joey Tribbiani: I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
