No thought was given to having

MR. KAMINETZKY:

Sure.

Thanks, Mr. Kaminetzky.

So,

Mr. Cushing's at your disposal.

6

everyone know that he has to be finished by 4:30, so it will

depend on how long parties anticipate cross-examining Mr.

Sackler.

He can go earlier if need be.

Okay.

Well, we'll see where we are

after the first three witnesses.

So why don't we proceed then.

As I understand it,

14

15

Legier.

16
17

MR. O'NEIL:

Judge, this is Michael O'Neil on

behalf of the Hospital Group.

18
19

I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

THE COURT:

I think we --

I'm sorry.

You're going to have to be

closer to the microphone.

20

MR. O'NEIL:

I thought we had either Dr. Galan or

21

Dr. Gupta up first, but we're happy to take them in whatever

22

--

23

THE COURT:

Oh, I thought you had changed the

24

order so that Legier, Gupta, and Galan, we're going in that

25

order.

But if it's as per the original order of Galan,

Q

Do you have an understanding as to whether or not

5

parties could be added to the designated shareholder-

6

released parties list that are not currently disclosed?

7

A

I don't know.

8

Q

You testified in paragraph 2 of your declaration that

9

you and your family are only willing to support the plan if

10

all civil claims against you for Purdue's opioid-related

11

activities are fully, finally, and permanently released.

12

that correct?

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

Right.

15

A

-- to include all of Purdue's conduct.

16

Q

And you're asking -- you're actually asking for a

17

release of claims that also relates to non-opioid products.

18

Is that correct?

19

A

Yes; as paragraph 4 indicates.

20

Q

And you're also seeking a release that goes beyond the

21

claims that have actually been filed against you by states

22

and other third parties.

23

A

That is correct.

24

Q

And if I could just direct you, no need to turn to it,

25

I'm just going to read you some of the language from the

212-267-6868

Is

And then I expanded upon that in paragraph 4 --

Is that correct?

Veritext Legal Solutions

516-608-2400

Page 31
1

release provision in the plan, if that's okay.

2

A

Okay.

3

Q

You're seeking a release for claims related to the

4

Debtor's "development, production, manufacture, licensing,

5

labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution,

6

or sale of non-opioid products or the use or receipt of any

7

proceeds therefrom in each case including the Debtor's

8

interaction with regulators regardless of where in the world

9

any such activities for any result, loss, injury, or damage

10

resulting therefrom occur."

11

Are you generally familiar with that portion of

12

the release provision?

13

A

14

it, I'm re-familiarized, I guess.

15

Q

16

to non-opioid provisions, isn't it true that you're seeking

17

a release that would extinguish claims related to the

18

Debtors' products that treat things like high cholesterol or

19

constipation and that have nothing to do with opioids?

20

A

Correct.

21

Q

To your knowledge, are any of the lawsuits against you

22

or your family completely unrelated to opioids or opioid-

23

related activities?

24

A

I don't know.

25

Q

Do you have any knowledge of any lawsuits against you

I wouldn't say I'm familiar with it, but as you read

I would defer to my attorneys

10

Q

You're seeking a release related to the future use or

11

misuse of opioid products.

12

A

Correct.

13

Q

And, again, I'm going to read you a little bit of the

14

language from the plan.

15

related to "any past, present, or future use or misuse of

16

any opioid whether sold by the Debtors or by Newco or any of

17

its subsidiaries or otherwise."

18

Isn't that correct?

You're seeking a release for claims

So you're seeking a release for claims based on

19

conduct that may have not even occurred yet.

20

correct?

21

A

Absolutely, yes.

22

Q

And you're also seeking a release that would extinguish

23

any claims related to fraud.

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

To your knowledge, has any Sackler family member filed

2

A

Not to my knowledge, no.

3

Q

Are you aware that liability related to fraud is not

4

dischargeable for an individual debtor in personal

5

bankruptcy?

6

A

I'd have to defer to my lawyers.

7

Q

In paragraph 4 of your declaration, you testified that

8

your family has offered billions of dollars as part of the

9

proposed shareholder settlement.

Is that correct?

10

A

That is correct, yes.

11

Q

And under the plan, that money would be paid out over

12

nine years or ten years if certain payments are made ahead

13

of schedule.

14

A

That's correct.

15

Q

Do you have any understanding as to whether the amount

16

of money your family will contribute under the plan will be

17

more or less than your family's expected investment returns

18

over the nine-year period?

19

A

I don't think anybody can say that with any certainty.

20

Q

Have any financial advisors informed you of whether --

21

of what your family's expected investment return would be

22

over that nine-year period?

23

A

24

worthless.

25

Is that correct?

No, they have not.

Q

3

look forward to the time that the billions of dollars your

4

family has offered from the settlement can be put to work to

5

abate the opioid crisis but also that your family won't

6

agree to make the payments in the plan without the broad

7

releases.

8

A

That is correct, yes.

9

Q

You're aware that several parties, including my office,

In paragraph 4 of your declaration, you say that you

Is that correct?

10

nine states, and the United States Attorneys Office, argue

11

that the proposed releases are impermissible?

12

A

I am aware of that.

13

Q

If the bankruptcy court decides that it won't or that

14

it can't approve the releases as currently proposed because

15

they're too broad, would you have to reevaluate your

16

position?

17

A

I'm not sure I understand your question.

18

Q

Sure.

19

pay the billions of dollars offered under the settlement

20

agreement if you receive the releases currently proposed

21

under the plan.

22

A

That's correct.

Q

So if the bankruptcy court decided that it wouldn't

approve those releases, would you still be willing to

Well, as I recall at the time, what was happening was

11

the debtor Perdue was negotiating an exit from Symproic with

12

the company we had licensed it from.

13

contractually had a certain number of calls that we had to

14

make with our salesforce to honor that contract.

15

they were negotiating the exit from that contract, which

16

would fully eliminate the field force, they were going to

17

continue to call on physicians for Symproic to honor the

18

contract so we wouldn't breach.

19

out of that license, I think took about another two months.

So that was the plan at the time.

here because, you know, the discussions were ongoing and

the Board was told that promotion of opioids by sales reps

So far, you are.

10

Q

And do you -- do you -- are you aware that those

11

allegations that were settled were related to kickbacks in

12

the marketing of Oxycontin, it may be called something else,

13

but Oxycodone Extended Release, in Italy?..

I don't know that and all the details that this would

17

Q

Of my knowledge would be privileged.
No, I don't think your knowledge is

18

privileged, Mr. Sackler, but are you aware that the Italian

19

Mundipharma entity settled allegations of kickbacks related

20

to opioids?

21

A

I don't recall the details of the settlement, no.

22

Q

Okay.

23

A

It was a number of years ago.

24

Q

You have no reason to -- do you have any reason to

25

believe -- do you have any reason to deny that the

Mundipharma Italian entity did not enter a resolution of its

5

Q

6

against any other Sackler owned entities operating

7

throughout the world?

8

A

Yes.

9

Q

In which ones?

10

A

Canada, which has been pretty extensively discussed

11

during this hearing.

12

Q

I understand Canada.

13

A

No, I'm not aware of any others.

14

businesses, there are regulatory actions that -- oh, I

15

should also mention the -- well, there are regulatory

16

actions in the businesses that pop off and are settled or

17

resolved.

18

but that's part of -- part of the business over time.

19

Q

20

have popped up that are now resolved involving any of the

21

Sackler owned entities and their promotion or marketing or

22

sale of opioids?

23

A

I just don't know the situation well enough anymore to

Okay.

And are you aware of any other allegations

Any others besides Canada.
I mean, like all

And I'm not aware of any that are ongoing now,

But -- so, are you aware of any regulatory actions that

No.

24
25

I believe that's correct.

MR. ALBERT:

THE COURT:

But what -- Mr. Edmunds, what is the -

2

- I'm not quite sure, I thought I understood the basis for

3

this questioning, but I'm not at this point, I'm not sure I

4

do.

So, what is --

5

MR. EDMUNDS:

6

THE COURT:

7

-- the purpose for -- of these

questions?

8
9

I think --

MR. EDMUNDS:

There are a couple, Your Honor.

One

purpose, obviously, is that they are seeking releases for

10

these entities and, you know, related to their own conduct

11

involving in any way opioids, and both --

12

THE COURT:

13

MR. EDMUNDS:

14

THE COURT:

15

MR. EDMUNDS:

16

THE COURT:

Actually, I don't --- some non-opioids.
Can we -- can we stop on that point.
Sure.
As I understood it from the statements

17

earlier in the trial, the releases they're seeking are in

18

respect of claims based on the U.S. companies' activities

19

that may be asserted by foreign people, but U.S. based.

20

I think if you're asking about claims that are being made

21

based on the activities of the foreign entities, that isn't

22

correct.

23

The Plan doesn't seek that type of release.
MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, it was my understanding

24

that the Plan releases the foreign entities for any

25

involvement in Purdue's conduct, which --

212-267-6868

So,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

516-608-2400

Page 103
1

THE COURT:

Right, Purdue's conduct.

And if

2

you're asking questions about Purdue's conduct, vis-à-vis

3

these foreign entities, I understand; that's relevant.

4

not relevant if you're asking questions about these

5

entities' own conduct because that's not covered by the

6

release?

7

MR. EDMUNDS:

It's

My -- my second -- the second reason

8

in which I think it is relevant is that they're asking for

9

releases of themselves, you know, related to the marketing

10

of opioids or non-opioids, and I think that those release,

11

as Mr. Higgins pointed out, involve conduct even in the

12

future.

13
14

And so, I think -THE COURT:

No, but again, as I understood it,

that is for U.S. based conduct.

15

MR. EDMUNDS:

And I think, Your Honor, that what

16

occurs in the entities that Mr. Sackler and other members of

17

the family run is relevant to the appropriateness of such a

18

release of future behavior.

19

If the Court is going to consider releasing them

20

from conduct in the future, it ought to know that even, you

21

know, as recently as the settlement in Italy, a few years

22

ago, and in the other regulatory activities I was about to

23

ask Mr. Sackler of now, I think that is relevant to whatever

24

releases of future conduct or releases are appropriate.

25

so, it would relate to issues that the objecting states have

212-267-6868

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

And

516-608-2400

Page 104

raised in their three objections in which, you know, there

2

is a sovereign decision to be made about whether a release -

6
7

MR. EDMUNDS:

10

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

And we

do not --

8
9

The states don't have any sovereignty

THE COURT:
ground here.

So, I think we're going over old

If you're talking about future claims based on

U.S. activity, I think you're getting --

11

MR. EDMUNDS:

12

THE COURT:

I think --- pretty far away from the fact given

13

the condition in the settlement that the Sacklers don't

14

engage in any U.S. opioid related activity.

15
16

So, I think given the time constraints here, this
really is getting to be irrelevant at this point.

17
18

MR. EDMUNDS:

All right.

'

Your Honor, I will -- I

will move on.

19

MR. ROBINSON O'NEILL:

Your Honor, this is Tad

20

Washing -- or Tad Robinson O'Neill from Washington state.

21

May I be heard on this particular issue?

22

THE COURT:

Okay.

23

MR. ROBINSON O'NEILL:

As I understand it, Your

24

Honor, the funding for the Sackler payments will be paid in

25

large part based on the sale of the independent affiliated

212-267-6868

516-608-2400

Page 105

companies, including companies abroad.

2

and potential regulatory actions against those companies may

3

very well adversely impact the value of those -- that sale

4

and the Sackler ability to pay the obligations under this

5

contract.

6
7

I would request that it is relevant, Your Honor,
or some inquiry into the IACs.

8
9
10

Regulatory actions

MR. ALBERT:

The IA -- the sale of the IACs is not

a condition of the payment.

It's just some security.

The

family is obliged to make the payments --

11

THE COURT:

No, I -- that, there is some relevance

12

to that line of inquiry.

13

Edmunds was getting at.

14

It wasn't the relevance that Mr.

So, I guess a question can be asked as to the

15

magnitude of such allegations and, you know, whether the

16

witness has any concerns as to the ability to pay the

17

settlement.

18

That's a fair question to ask.

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, I could asked (sic) -- I

19

would just ask to be able to ask what the -- he mentioned

20

regulatory activities of which he is aware, and I think that

21

the underlying nature of those activities will -- you know,

22

determining what he means by that may impact whether there

23

is cause to be concerned about the future value with the

24

IACs.

MR. EDMUNDS:

THE COURT:

So, that's what I would ask.
Well, that's not where you were -It's --- going, but you can ask questions

5

about the future viability of the IACs and the ability to

pay the settlement.

7

BY MR. EDMUNDS:

8

Q

9

activities, regulatory, I guess, actions that have been

That's fair.

Well, so -- Mr. Sackler, you had mentioned regulatory

10

brought -- commenced against Sackler companies worldwide and

11

my question was at the beginning of all of this, whether

12

those regulatory activities involve allegations about the

13

marketing or sale of Mundipharma opioids?

14

A

15

believe that I know of any others that are ongoing.

16

I was thinking of has closed out now.

17

but I don't know of any other ongoing regulatory activities,

18

maybe a tax regulatory activity to -- for a nominal sum in

19

Europe, but I'm not 100 percent certain on that.

20

So, if you'd like to discuss the Australia action, which is

21

public now, I can do that.

22

nominal -- I think about $400,000 Australian, with the

23

government.

24

Q

And what were Australia's allegations?

A

That one line in a -- I think an off-branded marketing

A

13

you know, not regular basis, but they do occur.

14

Q

Australia, at least, taking action for entities that the

16

Sackler family owns and controls, activities in the sale and

17

marketing of opioids into its countries; is that right?

18

A

No.

19

Q

What is not right about that.

20

A

Your verb, taking, is wrong.

-- Australia and Italy are closed out.

right?

Yes, I believe so.

And --

7

A

But I want to be -- I want to be clear though, I can't

8

speak for the A Side.

9

I'm only talking about the B Side when you --

Let me turn -- the shares of Purdue and the other

So,

10

Q

The B Side of the family holds shares in trust, or the

11

shares are held by trusts for the benefit of you and other

12

members of the B family; is that right?

13

A

That's correct, yes.

14

Q

And those trusts -- as the Director of Purdue, you have

your family had a moral responsibility to help those harmed

6

A

Yes.

7

Q

Are you admitting here today that you have a legal

8

responsibility to pay for those people who have been harmed

9

by the opioid crisis in the United States?

Do you recall that testimony?

allegations against our family are legally meritus.

deeply that OxyContin was a part of the opioid crisis

16

of the settlement.

Well, I mean all those entities have with them the net

MR. UNDERWOOD:

I think the purpose for asking the

8

question, Your Honor, is to have a better understanding of

9

what the Sackler's family expectation of the results of this

10

process is and I'm not sure there's a privilege aspect to

11

that.

THE COURT:

notwithstanding the claims by Creditors against the IACs

22

that are not subject to the release under the plan, the net

23

proceeds, whether in terms of cash flow or sale proceeds,

24

along with the settling parties' other assets, will be

25

sufficient to fund the settlement?

THE WITNESS:

Oh, boy, Your Honor.

I'm having

difficulty following that.

3

THE COURT:

The question is -- let me ask it

4

differently.

Your answer assumes that the net proceeds from

5

the IACs would go to fund the settlement in all likelihood

6

and under certain circumstances, they would have to be sold.

7

But you referred to net proceeds, net of liabilities.

8

THE WITNESS:

9

THE COURT: So the question is from your side of

10

things, not the Debtor's side or the Creditor's side, but

11

from your side of things, do you believe that the net

12

proceeds, which assumes, of course, it's net of all claims

13

against those entities, including claims that aren't

14

released, would be sufficient, along with your families'

15

other assets, to pay the settlement?

16

THE WITNESS:

Yes.

Certainly, yes.

I believe that's

17

the case, though, again, I would defer back to the Creditors

18

Committee here, the Unsecured Creditors Committee and the

19

Debtor who have done extensive diligence on this more than I

20

could ever present.

21

THE COURT:

But as far as you're concerned, you're

22

not agreeing to something that you believe your family is

23

going to default on?

THE WITNESS:

Certainly not, no.

above approximately $4.6 billion.

Is this more or less an

Q

Do you agree with that?

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

And are you aware that, therefore, irrespective of

4

whether the IACs sell for 2 billion, 3 billion, 1 billion, 4

5

billion, or some other number, your obligation in the

6

current deal is to pay $4.325, irrespective of IAC net sale

7

proceeds?

8

A

That's correct.

9

Q

Okay.

And do you understand that if you fail to pay

10

that, whether because the IAC sale proceeds are less than

11

you hoped them to be, or for any other reason, that the

12

virtual certain consequence of that is that the estate and

13

many, many other parties, likely numbering in the hundreds

14

or thousands, will go back to suing you, or the Debtors'

15

estate, obviously created recently, will commence suing you

16

for probably tens of billions or more of dollars?

17

A

Yes, I am aware of that.

18

Q

Okay.

19

people asked you about your goals and aspirations, which

20

frankly are not really of great interest to me -- I care

21

about your obligations -- do you understand that the current

settlement agreement obligates the Sackler Family to exit

23

the worldwide pharmaceutical industry in a fixed period of

24

time?

25

A

Yes.

Does anyone else object to its

We certainly don't object to its admission.

8
9

Just one procedural point for five seconds.

I do want to be clear and remind everybody -because there's a lot of cross examination going on that may

10

or may not really be needed -- there is a stipulation that

11

we've read into the record.

12

are not bound nor in any way deemed to agree to anything in

13

this or any other witness's testimony, which for that reason

14

that we're not engaging in quite extensive cross examination

15

of every witness.

16

And the Debtors, for example,

And so again, I know that's nothing everyone

17

doesn't know, but since there are people dancing in and out

18

of the hearing, frankly, and some people quite new to the

19

case, not everybody I think understood the stipulation the

20

first time.

21

I do want to be clear for the record with respect

22

to this and following witnesses that the Debtor's lack of

23

(indiscernible) cross examination and silence does not bind

24

the estate to any form of agreement with the content of any

25

witness's declaration or testimony.

THE COURT:

Right.

And as I stated repeatedly

2

when this point has come up, I find it very hard to believe

3

that there would be any collateral estoppel effect from the

4

failure -- or not even the failure -- from the fact that

5

there is not cross exam of Mr. Cushing in any subsequent

6

litigation.

7

for any party in interest in the case.

8
9

And that applies not only for the Debtors but

I am considering Mr. Cushing's expert testimony
only insofar as it reflects on the issues pertaining to my

10

consideration of the proposed settlement -- that is a

11

central element of the Debtor's Chapter 11 plan -- and not

12

with respect to the merits of any underlying litigation that

13

might ensue if the settlement is not approved or if the

14

settlement is breached and there is subsequent litigation.

15

So does anyone want to cross examine Mr. Cushing

16

on his declaration, which again is an expert declaration

17

with respect to the law of the Bailiwick of Jersey as it

18

applies as discussed in the declaration itself?

THE COURT:

3

Yes, sir.
If you take a look at Paragraph 10.19

on Page 11.

4

THE WITNESS:

5

THE COURT:

Yes, sir.
And in that paragraph, you state your

6

belief that even if therefore and in persona before a

judgment against the trustees would be enforceable as a

9

The judgment would be

Article 9 of the trusts (Jersey) law 1984 to the extent that

the judgment itself is inconsistent with the provision of

Article 9.

Do you see that opinion?

13

THE WITNESS:

14

THE COURT:

I do, sir.

Yes.

So the question I have then is I take

15

it from that that you reached the conclusion that if there

16

is an inconsistency, the plaintiff that obtained the foreign

17

judgment would have to start over again in Jersey; is that a

18

fair --

19

THE WITNESS:

It is, sir, because the -- the

20

provisions of the trust law, Article 9 particularly of the

21

trust law, are designed to ensure that Jersey trusts are

22

only construed, interpreted and the validity of those trusts

23

is determined applying only matters of Jersey law rather

than (indiscernible) foreign law.

Right.

But my -- so let me -- I'll

8

ask you my next question, which is if the judgment creditor

9

started over again in the Royal Court in Jersey, would that

10

court then apply principles of choice of law to decide

11

whether the issue should be decided under Jersey law or

12

under the foreign law?

13

law principles to decide what law should apply on the

under Jersey law?

So it would apply Jersey choice-of-

Is that a concept that applies in --

Q

You have a BA in economics?

21

A

I have a BA in economics.

22

Q

And you have an MBA as well, correct?

23

A

That is correct.

24

Q

So is it -- is it your position that any one of the

25

tens or hundreds of thousands of people that have an MBA are

Mr. Hrycay -- and it is Mr. Hrycay, correct?

212-267-6868

You don't

I have --

Page 171
1

qualified to give the opinion that you gave in this case?

2

A

My opinion is based upon --

3

Q

That's a yes or no.

4

itself is sufficient qualification to give the opinion

5

you've given in this case?

6

A

Not necessarily, no.

7

Q

So there's something about your background which

8

qualifies you to give this opinion, correct?

9

A

I believe so.

10

Q

And it's not that you've ever worked as a professional

11

wealth manager, correct?

12

A

13

No, sir.

14

Q

15

investment portfolios, correct?

16

A

That's correct.

17

Q

You have your report in front of you?

18

A

I will.

19

Q

Sure.

20

2.

21

A

A

2

Q

You're not a managing director either.

3

A

No, sir.

4

Q

And then the next sentence says, "He specializes in

5

expert analysis relevant to securities litigation."

6

see that?

7

A

Yes, sir.

8

Q

Judge Furman doesn't consider you an expert in

9

securities litigation analysis, does he?

Do you

10

A

Judge Furman admitted my testimony as expert testimony.

11

Q

And then he rejected it.

12

A

He had criticism of it, sir.

13

Q

He rejected it; did he not?

14

A

He rejected the conclusions I had.

15

Q

In fact, the only other case in which you've testified

16

as an expert is the Atlantica Securities case in front of

17

Judge Furman last year, correct?

18

A

It was two years ago, but otherwise correct.

19

Q

And you testified for the plaintiff on loss causation,

20

right?

21

A

Loss causation and damages, sir.

22

Q

But he rejected your opinion on loss causation because

23

you did not disaggregate losses caused by non-fraud factors,

24

right?

25

A

That was his opinion.

212-267-6868

Yes.

Correct.

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

Page 173
1

Q

And he also held that you didn't even try to identify

2

or calculate losses from other factors, correct?

3

A

That was his opinion.

4

Q

So basically, he said you failed to account for

5

multiple variables that could've caused the loss, right?

6

A

I -- yes.

7

Q

All right.

8

focus on your work here concerning the Raymond Sackler

9

family.

Yes, sir.

I believe that's what that means.
So I'm -- now, in this case, I'm going to

I believe Ms. Monaghan may have some questions

10

relating to the Mortimer Sackler family.

11

that in mind?

12

A

I will try to bear that in mind.

13

Q

All right.

14

9, Paragraph 16 of your report.

15

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

And one thing you did as part of your assignment in

17

this case was to take the net asset statement of the Raymond

18

Sackler family as of September 30, 2020 and estimate what

19

those assets would be six months later, as of March 31,

20

2021, correct?

21

A

That's correct.

22

Q

And if we look at Page 13 and Exhibit 6 of your report,

23

you estimated -- and I'm looking at the third column from

24

the right, which says "value as of 9-30-2020" at the bottom.

25

It says the value, and this was a Huron reported value,

4

in six months, if we look over on the far right-hand side,

5

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

So that's about a $600 million increase in six months

8

that you projected.

9

A

Approximately, yes.

10

Q

And after you submitted your report, Huron prepared a

11

net asset report showing the value of Side B's assets, the

12

Raymond Sackler family, as of March 31, 2021, correct?

And you have no idea whether the marketable securities

A

It could be.

And if the weighting were debt heavy, that would lower

At least Mr. Hrycay was able to sign on,

Q

In projecting the Raymond Sackler family's assets,

11

you've assumed that the asset allocation would remain static

12

over nine years, correct?

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

And you know, from the six-month report from Huron,

15

that that's not what's happening, correct?

16

A

17

from September 30th to March 31st, yes.

That sets out Side B's assets as of September 30, 2020,

Q

Now, if you look at Exhibit 1922, which is the updated

turn to Slide 10 of that.

I know that there were some changes to asset categories

Let's take a look at Page 9 of your report, Exhibit 4.

5

value presented in the updated net asset report.

6

that?

7

A

Yes, sir.

8

Q

So instead of remaining static, it increased by about a

9

third, right?

If you take a look at Bullet 3, it says the

You see

10

A

Yes, sir.

11

Q

And the reason it went up by that amount was because of

12

redemption from private equity funds, right?

13

A

That's what it says.

14

Q

Okay.

15

that was perfectly predictable that private equity funds or

16

hedge funds are going to be redeeming over time, correct?

17

A

I don't know whether that's predictable or not, sir.

Is it your understanding with private equity funds, the

different possible outcomes on the sale of the IACs,

Q

Mr. Hrycay, is it correct that your calculations assume

10

that none of the IACs were sold before 2027?

11

A

Yes.

12

Q

And so if any of the IACs were sold before 2027, your

13

calculations would not reflect that.

14

A

No, the calculations wouldn't reflect that.

15

Q

Did you review the settlement agreement terms with

respect to the IAC sales and what the obligations are of the

17

Sackler families and the trusts that own the IACs?

A

That may be correct.

9

Q

And your model takes no account of that, correct?

10

A

The model assumes that they'd be sold in 2027.

11

Q

Mr. Hrycay, Mr. Joseph asked you some questions about

12

the fact that there's been a diligence process undertaken by

13

groups of creditors with respect to the value of the IACs.

14

Do you recall that?

He did.

12

qualifications around that.

13

They had some

They said it was based on limited information, mostly

14

that they know from the BlackRock universe of investing, and

15

therefore, I thought it was more reasonable, more

16

conservative to employ a rate of return that reflected a

17

broader asset mix, and that being the 60/40 equity/debt

18

split that we discussed earlier and so I ended up using a 5

19

percent growth rate rather than 18 percent growth rate for

20

that category of assets which I think was about $1.6 billion

21

as of -- in the Huron report.

22

was one of the conservative assumptions.

23

Yes, $1.66 billion.

So that

Using the 60/40 asset split overall in many of these

24

categories, is conservative for a high net worth individual;

25

60/40 is -- it's kind of a rule of thumb that you've seen in

212-267-6868

investment management. Keep 60 percent of your assets in

2

debt and 40 percent -- I'm sorry, 60 percent in equity, 40

3

percent debt, and, you know, it's a rule of thumb that's

4

used for people who are -- need that money to pay the

5

mortgage and if the market goes down 20 percent, they can't

6

-- you know, it's going to impact them, but they don't want

7

to be in equity funds if it goes down 20 percent.

9

So, you know, but as you get -- a general principle in
finance, is that if you get -- for the most part, when you

10

have -- if you're dealing with higher levels of wealth, that

11

there's (indiscernible) less sensitivity to those kinds of

12

(indiscernible), and so you see -- tend to see a little bit

13

more of an equity split.

14

assumption, but was also a category in BlackRock asset

15

projections that was for, I believe it's called private

16

lending, which had a rate of return over 9 percent.

17

That was another conservative

I didn't apply that to any of the group.

So overall,

18

as the Kane report actually pointed out, the rate of return

19

I end up applying is about 5.4 percent across the total mix

20

and I think that's pretty consistent with a number of ways

21

to get there, including some reasonable mix of debt and

22

equity.

23

Q

Anything else (indiscernible) on assumptions?

24

A

Well, I mean, one of the assumptions is that the --

25

when the payments are made, there's no countervailing tax

time I wrote my report -- subsequent report.

these assets -- I'm sorry, for these payments, to receive

certain tax treatment that would reduce the impact from $4.2

billion or thereabouts.

7

there's -- apply the 33 percent tax rate that is used in the

8

Martin report to the full amount, just for illustration,

9

then that's about a $1.4 billion benefit that nets out.

I think it was

drivers of the difference between the net asset value that I

Fairly clearly.

15

A

No, I did not.

16

Q

Okay.

17

We'll try it.

Did you listen to David Sackler's testimony

So, let's just make the assumption that Mr.

We just take that as an assumption, since I

If, hypothetically, the Sacklers sold all of the

testified that your math assumed that they held, invested,

2

and grew $4.5 billion in value for the entire period?

3

that largely materially drop your terminal estimate of their

4

wealth if in year one or two, $4.5 billion disappeared?

5

A

6

What are you assuming the sale price is?

7

Q

8

the lower the sale price, the more they have to dip into

9

other assets to pay us, so let's go with that assumption for

10

the beginning, which is they sell them for $4.5 billion net.

11

A

12

the period, let's say 2022, then that would reduce some of

13

the -- that would -- yes, it would reduce the estimated

14

value I have on the IAC, which assumes that the two-year-old

15

estimate on what the sale price is likely to be, would be --

16

would turn out different than that.

17

family would be able to keep the rest of its assets, so that

18

would be something of an offset.

19

something of an offset between the tax liability that

20

assumed also grew at the same 7 percent plus rate, so there

21

would be a couple of offsets, but certainly, if they only

22

sold for 4.5, then that would reduce the net asset value I

23

projected.

24

Q

25

agreement they're obligated to pay us the net proceeds,

Would

So that's a great question, and you're right, because

If they sell for $4.5 billion net, at the beginning of

potentially, as soon as they are realized?

Are you aware of

2

that?

3

A

Yeah, that's my read of the agreement.

4

Q

Right.

5

IACs would move material assets from the Sacklers'

6

investible asset base on an accelerated basis; is that

7

correct?

8

A

9

then that removes the asset from their asset base.

Yes, sir.

So, in other words, an accelerated sale of the

Yeah, if they sell the IACs next year, for example,

10

Q

Right.

11

billion, on an accelerated basis, then they would actually

12

suffer a radically greater decline in wealth, because they

both wouldn't have that spread, and they would have to dip

14

into personal assets to pay along the schedule provided for

15

in the settlement.

A

17

18

(indiscernible) assets, and that would --

19

Q

But again, I was asking you a different question.

A

I beg your pardon.

21

Q

Which is, doesn't that -- which everything you said so

22

far is right, just you didn't get to the last part, which

23

is, that means that their terminal wealth would be very much

24

lower, right, because they would both have a lower IAC sale

25

recovery and they would have to dip into other assets, so

Yes.

212-267-6868

And if they sold them for much less than $4.5

Is that correct?

Hypothetically, if they sold for less than $4.5

And I’m going to be asking questions probably
So let me start

Am I right, sir, that you’ve never designed an opioid

6

allocation program that’s actually been implemented?

7

A

That’s correct.

8

Q

And am I right that aside from this case, you’ve never

worked on any litigation involving allocation or abatement

10

in the context of opioid use?

11

A

That’s correct.

Q

And aside from this case, you’ve never worked on any

And would you agree with me, sir, that the issues we’re

4

dealing with in the context of this bankruptcy, vis-à-vis

Yes.

And would you agree with me, sir, that reasonable

your white papers, you’ve written about the difficulty of

7

putting in place a global settlement in the context of

Yes.

And you understand that the attorneys general who

11

negotiated these settlements, this settlement, are competent

Yes.

And they are the chief legal officers of their various

Yes.

6

Q

And you have a plan in your own -- you set out a plan

7

in your report, did you not?

developed is a compromise mathematically in the sense that

it falls between two other points.

a compromise between two groups of people or the result of

That’s correct.

5

Q

This is something you came up with for litigation,

6

right?

7

A

This was something I came up with for litigation, yes.

8

Q

And in your white paper, the allocation factors you

9

used were two health expenses -- two health expense series,

10

three law enforcement and judicial, the number of opioids

11

prescribed, and the number of deaths resulting from

12

overdose.

13

A

That’s one of several, yes.

Q

Okay.

And you have fair hypotheticals in your Fair White

Paper, do you not?

Q

And would you agree that hundreds of thousands of

15

people have died since 1996 on account of opioid addiction

and abuse?

Q

And the more time that this problem festers without

additional spending on opioid abatement, the worse the

problem will become, right?

Relative to no resolution, yes, I agree.

Now, Mr. Wagner asked you a series, a

lengthy series of questions of various types about the

account for the fact that some states have greater

there’s an adjustment for intensity that is uncorrelated

However, the intensity of the -- of opioid use

Is that correct?

2

the most critical to a proper allocation of funds

would prefer a plan that relies on intensity measures and

severity measures rather than a plan that is heavily

dependent on levels, like the size of the population.

11

Whether it’s part of the plan or overall, levels aren’t

12

measuring something specific to the cost of abatement or the

13

population of people who are affected, it measures a class

14

that’s relative to the entire population, which include many

15

people who are not affected by opioids.

16

So I would prefer any plan that focused more on

17

intensity and severity because that’s what drives the costs.

18

And it is the population over the next ten years that would

19

be subject to treatment as opposed to the full population

20

within a state.

apart from this one?

Dr. Cowan, did I hear you correct me that you said you

Yes.

MR. OZMENT:

Your Honor, I think if he is

testifying that he has worked on allocation plans other than

7

the cost is going to differ from person to person because

8

there is quite a bit of literature that talks about the

9

amount of time it takes people to get off of opioids and the

I apologize, Mr. Ozment.

I don’t mean to make this
But let me point out that

10

fact that there is a recurrence relationship that’s -- I’m

11

using recurrence in the statistical jargon -- where people

12

become addicted again and then they have to get off again.

13

And in some cases, they need training to go find a new job.

14

Or in other cases, they have a good job, they are well-

15

trained, they just need to get off of drugs, so they don’t

16

get that kind of training.

17

So it varies quite a bit, but I have heard numbers

18

anywhere between, you know, for any individual per year, and

19

this is an annual cost, of $60,000 to $100,000.

20

think about the fact that the average time to get off of

21

opioids is on average eight years, that adds up to nearly a

22

million dollars per person.

Dr. Cowan.

I think that is a good

The other two witnesses who we

thought we might get to today are Richard Sackler and

MR. POPOFSKY:

Let me ask before we close for the day, do

Yes, Your Honor.

We’ll send that

10

to you within the next few minutes.

back and forth all day with the various parties.

12

Is it contemplated that we’ll go

MR. POPOFSKY:

16

THE COURT:

17

MR. POPOFSKY:

Unfortunately, yes, Your Honor.

Okay.

I mean, this isn’t debtor-driven,

4

Okay.

Well, why don’t we see where we

And then we’ll talk about Thursday.

MR. EDMUNDS:

Your Honor, just if I may, I think

5

that there is a question of availability.

6

that we will go the whole day tomorrow, but I believe that

7

additional Sackler witnesses are not available until

8

Thursday.

9

So that’s where we are.
THE COURT:

10

MR. EDMUNDS:

I am not sure

But --

Well, what about -(indiscernible) would be the last

11

witnesses.

12

after the Sackler family testifies, but I think he is a

13

short witness and I think it would be largely in response to

14

what happens there.

15

We do have one additional witness we might call

witnesses?

MR. EDMUNDS

So is it fair to say that there are a

few Sackler witnesses and then one other witness after that

22

perhaps?

23

MR. EDMUNDS:

That’s correct, for the State of

Maryland, Your Honor.

25

account for anyone else who may be coming in, because I

It’s only the State of Maryland,

Your Honor.

5

THE COURT:

And it sounds like that witness may or

6

may not be testifying, so we can’t -- it doesn’t really make

7

sense to have that person testify if one of the Sackler

8

witnesses isn’t available tomorrow.

9

MR. EDMUNDS:

10

THE COURT:

Is that fair?

Correct, Your Honor.
Okay.

Correct.

All right, very well.

So we’ll

11

12

what you did before, which is submit your -- the exhibits

13

that you intend to use, and try to do it with the one that

14

you’re actually going to use.

15

that weren’t used this time and had to change the toner and

16

almost burn up the copy machine.

17

make sure that there’s a good chance you will use these

exhibits.
