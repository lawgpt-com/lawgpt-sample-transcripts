Rachel Green: Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Rachel Green: Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.
Phoebe Buffay: What?!
Rachel Green: Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Phoebe Buffay: Well did she know you two weren't married?
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
Rachel Green: You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Phoebe Buffay: Sounds like you're a little jealous.
Rachel Green: No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!
Phoebe Buffay: Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
Chandler Bing: Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Chandler Bing: Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Phoebe Buffay: Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Chandler Bing: Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
Rachel Green: Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.
Chandler Bing: Why not?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, the interview...
Chandler Bing: What about it?
Phoebe Buffay: Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
Chandler Bing: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh you don't know.
Chandler Bing: Are you serious?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
Chandler Bing: What is it that I do?
Phoebe Buffay: Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
Chandler Bing: Did you like me when we first met?
Rachel Green: Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
