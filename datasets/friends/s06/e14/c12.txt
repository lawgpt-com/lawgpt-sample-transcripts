Chandler Bing: Hey.
Ross Geller: You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Rachel Green: Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Ross Geller: Umm, she kissed me.
Rachel Green: What?! You kissed!
Chandler Bing: Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Monica Geller: Shhhh!!!
Ross Geller: Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Rachel Green: Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Ross Geller: Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Rachel Green: Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Ross Geller: Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Rachel Green: Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Ross Geller: Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Rachel Green: What?!
Ross Geller: No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Rachel Green: Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Ross Geller: You're welcome.

Monica Geller: Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Chandler Bing: I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
