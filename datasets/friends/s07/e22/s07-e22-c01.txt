Ross Geller: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Rachel Green: Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Monica Geller: Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Ross Geller: It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Monica Geller: Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Rachel Green: You let Joey drive it?!
Phoebe Buffay: I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Monica Geller: Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Rachel Green: Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Monica Geller: Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Ross Geller: Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you got a couple hours?
