Joey Tribbiani: Chandler, is that...
Chandler Bing: Oh that's great! Good for you.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey listen...
Chandler Bing: Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Joey Tribbiani: When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Chandler Bing: Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.

Chandler Bing: Hi.
Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah-ha!
Monica Geller: Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Chandler Bing: Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Monica Geller: You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Chandler Bing: No, we only went out once.
Monica Geller: You dated her!
Chandler Bing: Not once!
Monica Geller: All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
