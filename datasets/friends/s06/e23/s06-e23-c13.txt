Phoebe Buffay: Hey.
Chandler Bing: I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Phoebe Buffay: It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Chandler Bing: No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Chandler Bing: I can't do that.
Phoebe Buffay: Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
