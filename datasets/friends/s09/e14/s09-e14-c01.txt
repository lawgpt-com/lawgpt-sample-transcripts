Joey Tribbiani: Morning, roomie!
Rachel Green: Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Joey Tribbiani: Fifth day's a charm.
Rachel Green: Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Ross Geller: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Rachel Green: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
Joey Tribbiani: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Rachel Green: Bye!
Ross Geller: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Joey Tribbiani: No, hey, it's been great.
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Ross Geller: Yeah, that'll do it.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow! So, how are you?
Ross Geller: I'm, I'm okay.
Joey Tribbiani: Really?
Ross Geller: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, actually it...
Ross Geller: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
Joey Tribbiani: Wow, really?
Ross Geller: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
Joey Tribbiani: Sure, I know lots of girls.
Ross Geller: Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Joey Tribbiani: Ooh, names? Opening credits.
