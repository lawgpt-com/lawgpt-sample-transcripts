Rachel Green: Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Ross Geller: Who the hell was that?!
Rachel Green: Dr. Wiener.
Ross Geller: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Rachel Green: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Ross Geller: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Rachel Green: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Ross Geller: Well, what was it?
Rachel Green: Hiccups.
Ross Geller: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
Rachel Green: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Ross Geller: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Rachel Green: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Ross Geller: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Rachel Green: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Ross Geller: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
Rachel Green: Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
Ross Geller: Rachel!!!
Rachel Green: Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
