Ross Geller: What?
Rachel Green: I don't want you to see me naked!
Ross Geller: Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Rachel Green: Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Ross Geller: Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Rachel Green: Ross! Stop that!
Ross Geller: Ah, I'm sorry.
Rachel Green: Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ross Geller: Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Rachel Green: Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ross Geller: Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Rachel Green: Rosss...
