Rachel Green: Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.
Bill: "Spuds" is your grandmother?
Rachel Green: That's my bubby!
Kevin: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties. Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.
Kevin: All right. It's no big deal.
Bill: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Rachel Green: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .
Bill: Then, can I have your number?
Rachel Green: I'm sorry, no.
Bill: Okay.
Rachel Green: Oh sure.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Bill: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
Rachel Green: Great.
Bill: Bye.
Phoebe Buffay: Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
Rachel Green: I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
Phoebe Buffay: What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
Rachel Green: No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
Rachel Green: "Yeah." "Me too."
Rachel Green: "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
Rachel Green: "Yeah." "Me neither."
Rachel Green: "Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
Rachel Green: "Yeah. That works for me."
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Rachel Green: Oh, thanks.
Phoebe Buffay: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Rachel Green: Wha. . . hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Better!
Rachel Green: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? You're moving on from Ross?
Rachel Green: I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Rachel Green: Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
Phoebe Buffay: "Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone." Dead on.
