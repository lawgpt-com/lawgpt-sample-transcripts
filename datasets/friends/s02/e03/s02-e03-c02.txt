Monica Geller: That's terrible.
Mr. Treeger: I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.

Phoebe Buffay: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Chandler Bing: Ok, Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Joey Tribbiani: Such as?
Phoebe Buffay: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Ross Geller: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Phoebe Buffay: Nah. Not really.

Phoebe Buffay: I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Ross Geller: Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Ross Geller: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Ross Geller: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Chandler Bing: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
