Gunther: So I understand you're looking for a place.
Rachel Green: No-no, I'm staying put.
Gunther: Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Rachel Green: Why, where are you going?
Gunther: I don't know.
Ross Geller: Hey Rach!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Ross Geller: You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Rachel Green: Oh wow.
Ross Geller: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Rachel Green: Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Ross Geller: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Rachel Green: Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Ross Geller: No!
Rachel Green: No?
Ross Geller: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Rachel Green: No! Not at all!
Ross Geller: Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Rachel Green: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Ross Geller: Really?! We are?
Rachel Green: Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Ross Geller: Ohh! That would be great.
Rachel Green: But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Ross Geller: Yeah, I didn't think of that.
