Man: Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
Joey Tribbiani: It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Ray: And this is Duncan and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
Joey Tribbiani: Rightie-O Ray!
Ray: Whenever you're ready.
Joey Tribbiani: Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
Erin: Wayne Gretzky.
Joey Tribbiani: Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Ray: Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules? We've eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
Joey Tribbiani: What-Why?!
Ray: Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.
Joey Tribbiani: Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
Ray: Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.
Joey Tribbiani: Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
Ray: Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
Joey Tribbiani: Let's play Bamboozled!
