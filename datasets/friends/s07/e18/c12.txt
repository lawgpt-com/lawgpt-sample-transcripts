Monica Geller: Have you seen Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay: No. Why?
Monica Geller: 'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Monica Geller: Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Phoebe Buffay: No that is the last thing you want to do!
Monica Geller: Why?
Phoebe Buffay: Because you're marrying him!
Monica Geller: You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Monica Geller: So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Phoebe Buffay: That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Monica Geller: Your mother told you this?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes!
Monica Geller: The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
