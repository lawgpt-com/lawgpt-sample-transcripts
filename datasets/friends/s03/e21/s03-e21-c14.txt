Monica Geller: I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Peter Becker: So you like it?
Monica Geller: Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Peter Becker: Oh, you're welcome.
Monica Geller: Did you just smell my hair?
Peter Becker: Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Monica Geller: Oh God.
Peter Becker: What?
Monica Geller: You still have feelings for me don't you?
Peter Becker: Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Monica Geller: Pete.
Peter Becker: Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Monica Geller: No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Peter Becker: Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Monica Geller: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Peter Becker: What?
Monica Geller: And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Peter Becker: Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
Monica Geller: Okay, bye.
