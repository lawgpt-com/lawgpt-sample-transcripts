Phoebe Buffay: Hey, you!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, how was class?
Ross Geller: No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Phoebe Buffay: Nothing, I really wanna know.
Ross Geller: Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene.
Phoebe Buffay: Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid.
Ross Geller: Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Phoebe Buffay: You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
Ross Geller: No, it wasn't.
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, it was.
Ross Geller: No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old.
Phoebe Buffay: "Gimme your money, punk!"
Ross Geller: Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!
Ross Geller: It's not the best!
Phoebe Buffay: I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.
Ross Geller: There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? Even more humiliating than.
Ross Geller: Hey, let's not do this!
