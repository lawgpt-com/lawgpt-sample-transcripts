Monica Geller: Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Mischa: Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Phoebe Buffay: Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.

Phoebe Buffay: You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Mischa: Boutros Boutros Gali.

Mischa: He says he was too.
Phoebe Buffay: Interesting.
Mischa: So I was wondering....
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.

Mischa: Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
Monica Geller: I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Mischa: Oh, really.
Phoebe Buffay: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Monica Geller: Well, I was having a conversation.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Monica Geller: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Phoebe Buffay: That would be great. Thank you.
