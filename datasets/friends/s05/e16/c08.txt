Phoebe Buffay: Excuse me, is this your car?
Guy: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Guy: Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Guy: So am I!
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Cop: Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
Phoebe Buffay: I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Cop: Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Cop: Who-who else is in vice up there?
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Cop: Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Cop: No, I don't know him.
Phoebe Buffay: Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Cop: Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Phoebe Buffay: I-I sure will, take care.
Cop: Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
