Chandler Bing: We are NOT signing those papers.
Monica Geller: Why not?
Chandler Bing: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica Geller: God works in mysterious ways.
Chandler Bing: You have gotta stop!
Monica Geller: But she liked us.
Chandler Bing: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica Geller: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
Chandler Bing: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Monica Geller: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Chandler Bing: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica Geller: Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Chandler Bing: I know..
Monica Geller: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Chandler Bing: oh, honey..
Monica Geller: Please.. please, we are so close.
Chandler Bing: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
Monica Geller: okay, right.
Chandler Bing: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Monica Geller: Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Chandler Bing: You're Jewish.
Monica Geller: Technicality!
