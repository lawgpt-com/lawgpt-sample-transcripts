Chandler Bing: Hey.
Monica Geller: What's the matter?
Chandler Bing: Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh Willie's still alive!
Chandler Bing: What are you guys doing?
Monica Geller: Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Chandler Bing: Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
Monica Geller: That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Chandler Bing: No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Chandler Bing: I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Monica Geller: Oh, here's a great one.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, I'm not in that.
Monica Geller: I know, but look at me all tan.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Monica Geller: That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Monica Geller: Chandler what do you say?
Chandler Bing: All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
