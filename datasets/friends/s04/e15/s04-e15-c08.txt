Rachel Green: You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Monica Geller: He asked you out?!
Rachel Green: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Monica Geller: Saucy!
Rachel Green: What are these?
Monica Geller: Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel Green: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Monica Geller: I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Rachel Green: Wow! If only more people knew.
