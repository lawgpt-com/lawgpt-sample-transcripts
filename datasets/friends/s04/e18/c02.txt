Emily Waltham: I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Ross Geller: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Emily Waltham: Ohh, it's time to go.
Ross Geller: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Emily Waltham: Well that's ambitious.

Ross Geller: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Emily Waltham: That's Carol with your son!
Ross Geller: Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
Carol Willick: Ross!
Ross Geller: I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Susan Bunch: Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Emily Waltham: Me too!
Carol Willick: Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Susan Bunch: Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Emily Waltham: Oh, well, I'll show you around.
Susan Bunch: That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Emily Waltham: Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Susan Bunch: Ahh!

Ross Geller: Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Emily Waltham: Are you all right?
Susan Bunch: Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Ross Geller: Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
