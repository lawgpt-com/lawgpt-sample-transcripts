Chandler Bing: Well, thank you for lunch.
Rachel Green: What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Chandler Bing: So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Rachel Green: Its still there!
Chandler Bing: Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Rachel Green: She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Chandler Bing: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Rachel Green: No that could kill her.
Chandler Bing: Well, we don't want that.
Rachel Green: No so we're protecting her.
Chandler Bing: But we should take it.
Rachel Green: But we should move quick.
Chandler Bing: Why?
Rachel Green: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Chandler Bing: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
