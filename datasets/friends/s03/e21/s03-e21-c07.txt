Chandler Bing: Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey.
Chandler Bing: Hey.
Joey Tribbiani: How's she doing?
Chandler Bing: She?
Joey Tribbiani: Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Chandler Bing: I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Joey Tribbiani: Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Chandler Bing: Excuse me?
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Chandler Bing: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Chandler Bing: You don't think I get up when you get up?
Joey Tribbiani: Ohhh, here it comes.
Chandler Bing: Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Chandler Bing: And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Joey Tribbiani: That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Chandler Bing: I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Chandler Bing: I'll take her back tomorrow.
Joey Tribbiani: Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Ross Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Ross Geller: Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Ross Geller: Really?
