Man: Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Rachel Green: Oh, thank you...
Man: You still don't know my name, do you?
Rachel Green: Well, now I don't have to.
Rachel Green: Ross, what is taking you so long?
Ross Geller: I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Mark Robinson: Rachel?
Rachel Green: Mark? Oh my God!
Mark Robinson: How've you been?
Rachel Green: I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Mark Robinson: Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
Ross Geller: Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Mark Robinson: Clever. So how are you?
Rachel Green: Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
Mark Robinson: Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
Rachel Green: No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Mark Robinson: Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Rachel Green: Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Mark Robinson: Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Rachel Green: Great! I'll call ya!
Mark Robinson: Nice to see you.
Ross Geller: Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Rachel Green: Oh my God!
Ross Geller: See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Rachel Green: Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Ross Geller: That is Mark?
Rachel Green: Yes.
Ross Geller: I hate that guy.
Rachel Green: Oh.
Ross Geller: No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Rachel Green: What? You don't want me to get a job?
Ross Geller: Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Rachel Green: Ugh.
Ross Geller: I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Rachel Green: Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
