Emily Waltham: I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Ross Geller: No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.

Ross Geller: Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Emily Waltham: No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Devon: Hey, mate.
Liam: How are ya man?
Ross Geller: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Emily Waltham: So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
Devon: Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Emily Waltham: Oh my God. I think you're right.
Liam: Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Emily Waltham: Oh, Liam.
Ross Geller: Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Devon: We were playing rugby.
Liam: In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Emily Waltham: Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Ross Geller: What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Emily Waltham: Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Ross Geller: Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
Devon: So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Liam: Cheers!
Ross Geller: Cheers!
