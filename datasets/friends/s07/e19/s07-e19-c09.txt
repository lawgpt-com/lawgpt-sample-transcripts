Phoebe Buffay: Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Rachel Green: Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Rachel Green: Hey! What's up Mon?
Monica Geller: Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Rachel Green: Have at it.
Monica Geller: Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Rachel Green: Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Monica Geller: No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.
Monica Geller: I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Rachel Green: We have to get her a present?!
Phoebe Buffay: Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Rachel Green: Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
