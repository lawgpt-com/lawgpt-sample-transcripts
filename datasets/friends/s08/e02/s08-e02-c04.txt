Ross Geller: Chandler?
Chandler Bing: Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Ross Geller: No. Did you?
Chandler Bing: Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
Ross Geller: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
Chandler Bing: Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
Ross Geller: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
Chandler Bing: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
Ross Geller: I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Chandler Bing: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Ross Geller: No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
Chandler Bing: Are you serious?
Ross Geller: I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Chandler Bing: Marriage advice? Really?!
Ross Geller: I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
Chandler Bing: I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
Ross Geller: What about the chairs?
Chandler Bing: She picked those out too.
Ross Geller: How about the place settings?
Chandler Bing: That was her.
Ross Geller: What did you do?
Chandler Bing: I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Ross Geller: Hmm.
