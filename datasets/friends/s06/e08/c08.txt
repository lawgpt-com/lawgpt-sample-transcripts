Monica Geller: Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Chandler Bing: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Monica Geller: Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Chandler Bing: Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Monica Geller: You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing: Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Monica Geller: Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Chandler Bing: You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Monica Geller: When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
