Rachel Green: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Monica Geller: Which one was Pete Carney?
Rachel Green: Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Monica Geller: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Rachel Green: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica Geller: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Phoebe Buffay: I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Monica Geller: There's more beer, right?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Rachel Green: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Monica Geller: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Phoebe Buffay: Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Rachel Green: Or?
Phoebe Buffay: Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Monica Geller: Burning's good.
Rachel Green: Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
