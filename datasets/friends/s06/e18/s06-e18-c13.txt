Ross Geller: We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!

Monica Geller: Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Ross Geller: Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey Tribbiani: Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Monica Geller: Joey that is so sweet.
