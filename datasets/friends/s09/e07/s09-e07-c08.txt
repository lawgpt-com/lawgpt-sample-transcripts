Chandler Bing: I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey dude, what's up?
Chandler Bing: Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Joey Tribbiani: Did you take that tape?
Chandler Bing: I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
Joey Tribbiani: I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Chandler Bing: Some girl...!?
Joey Tribbiani: She hot?
Chandler Bing: Yeah...!?
Joey Tribbiani: How did she get me to settle down?
Chandler Bing: Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
Joey Tribbiani: Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
Chandler Bing: Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Joey Tribbiani: What? Whoo... What?
Chandler Bing: Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
Joey Tribbiani: All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
Chandler Bing: Why am I hearing cheering?
Joey Tribbiani: Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Chandler Bing: Football? Just football?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Chandler Bing: It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani: You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Monica Geller: What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
