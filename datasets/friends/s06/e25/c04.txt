Rachel Green: We're gonna find love!
Phoebe Buffay: Definitely!
Rachel Green: Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
Phoebe Buffay: What do you mean?
Rachel Green: Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Phoebe Buffay: You mean a backup?
Rachel Green: Exactly!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, yeah I got that.
Rachel Green: You do?
Phoebe Buffay: Hm-mmm.
Rachel Green: Who?
Phoebe Buffay: Joey.
Rachel Green: Joey?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah!
Rachel Green: Are you serious?!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Rachel Green: Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Phoebe Buffay: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Rachel Green: Oh, seriously?
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Rachel Green: Charming.
Phoebe Buffay: Well hey, it's just a backup.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
