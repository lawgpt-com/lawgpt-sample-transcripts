Ross Geller: So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Chandler Bing: Yes!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh-ohh!
Monica Geller: Great!
Ross Geller: No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Phoebe Buffay: Why?
Monica Geller: What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Ross Geller: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Chandler Bing: Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Monica Geller: Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah.
Chandler Bing: That's true!
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Chandler Bing: That's true!
Monica Geller: No, you cannot.
Ross Geller: Thanks for the help, problem solved.
