Phoebe Buffay: Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Chandler Bing: Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Joey Tribbiani: You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Chandler Bing: Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Monica Geller: Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Chandler Bing: I'm not macho.
Monica Geller: Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Chandler Bing: No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Chandler Bing: I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Chandler Bing: Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Monica Geller: Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!

Phoebe Buffay: All right, what's going on there?
Chandler Bing: Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Monica Geller: Where were your parents?
Chandler Bing: Oh they didn't want to come!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh Chandler!
Monica Geller: Poor thing!
Phoebe Buffay: So that story doesn't make you cry?
Chandler Bing: No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Joey Tribbiani: No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
