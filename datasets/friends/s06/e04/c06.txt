Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
Chandler Bing: That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Joey Tribbiani: What?!
Chandler Bing: What's wrong with you?
Joey Tribbiani: Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
Chandler Bing: This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Joey Tribbiani: No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Chandler Bing: That's a hernia.
Joey Tribbiani: Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
