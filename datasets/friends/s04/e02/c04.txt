Monica Geller: Hey!
Rachel Green: Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Monica Geller: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Rachel Green: Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Monica Geller: What, that little thing at the prom?
Rachel Green: Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Monica Geller: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Rachel Green: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica Geller: Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Rachel Green: Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Monica Geller: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Rachel Green: They had to have that specially made?!
Monica Geller: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Rachel Green: Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Monica Geller: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Rachel Green: Oh, you go out with him.
Monica Geller: Oh, really?!
Rachel Green: Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Monica Geller: I'll try.
