Monica Geller: Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
Chandler Bing: Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Monica Geller: What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Chandler Bing: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
Monica Geller: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Chandler Bing: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Monica Geller: Rachel used to live in that room.
Chandler Bing: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Monica Geller: Joey's bare ass!
Chandler Bing: . Well played.
Rachel Green: I love you Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay: I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
Rachel Green: All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok.
Rachel Green: Ok. Monica?
Monica Geller: Yeah?
Rachel Green: Can you come here with me for a minute?
Monica Geller: Sure.
Phoebe Buffay: Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Monica Geller: No.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you're so screwed.
Ross Geller: Hey. What was that all about?
Phoebe Buffay: She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Ross Geller: Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Ross Geller: Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
