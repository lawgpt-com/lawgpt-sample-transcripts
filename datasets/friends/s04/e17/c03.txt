Ross Geller: Hi.
Monica Geller: Hi.
Ross Geller: So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Monica Geller: Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Ross Geller: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Monica Geller: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross Geller: Nah.
Monica Geller: Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Ross Geller: Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
Monica Geller: No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Ross Geller: And why do you care so much?
Monica Geller: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross Geller: You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica Geller: No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ross Geller: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Monica Geller: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross Geller: Ahh.
Monica Geller: Do you love her?
Ross Geller: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Monica Geller: You love her!
Ross Geller: What-what is love really?
Monica Geller: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Ross Geller: I am a good kisser.
Monica Geller: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
