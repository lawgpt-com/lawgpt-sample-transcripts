Cop: I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Rachel Green: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Cop: Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Phoebe Buffay: Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Cop: I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Phoebe Buffay: I would love it if I weren't here!
Cop: Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Phoebe Buffay: Me?!
Cop: Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Chandler Bing: Nice!
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Cop: Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Cop: Gary.
Phoebe Buffay: Gary.
Gary: Okay, so it's a date.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Gary: Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Phoebe Buffay: Ohh, impressive.
Gary: Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Gary: Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
Phoebe Buffay: All right, I can't wait!
Gary: Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
