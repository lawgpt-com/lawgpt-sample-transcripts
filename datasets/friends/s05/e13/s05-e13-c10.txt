Chandler Bing: Hey, is Rachel here?
Monica Geller: No.
Chandler Bing: Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Monica Geller: Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Chandler Bing: I don't like your massages.
Monica Geller: See? It's no big deal.
Chandler Bing: Okay, but now see you're crying!
Monica Geller: I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Chandler Bing: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Chandler Bing: Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Monica Geller: I'm crying here!!
Chandler Bing: Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Monica Geller: Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Chandler Bing: Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Monica Geller: So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Chandler Bing: Absolutely!
Monica Geller: Okay. I suck!
Chandler Bing: Yeah!
