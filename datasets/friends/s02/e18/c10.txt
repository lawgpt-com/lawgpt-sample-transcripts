Chandler Bing: Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Eddie Menuek: That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Chandler Bing: This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Eddie Menuek: Where's Buddy?
Chandler Bing: Buddy?
Eddie Menuek: My fish, Buddy.
Chandler Bing: There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Eddie Menuek: Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Chandler Bing: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
