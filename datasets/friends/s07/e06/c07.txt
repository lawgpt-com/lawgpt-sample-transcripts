Monica Geller: Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Chandler Bing: Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Monica Geller: You're Lewis Posin.
Chandler Bing: Who?
Monica Geller: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler Bing: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Monica Geller: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Chandler Bing: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica Geller: No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Chandler Bing: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
