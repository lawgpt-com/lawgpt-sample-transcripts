Rachel Green: Phoebe's Mike?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: I didn't know you guys hung out.
Ross Geller: We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Rachel Green: Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
Ross Geller: I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Hi.
Rachel Green: Hey.

Mike Hannigan: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.

Mike Hannigan: So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Mike Hannigan: My cousin's a paleontologist.
Ross Geller: Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
