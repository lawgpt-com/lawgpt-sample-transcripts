Joey Tribbiani: Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Ross Geller: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Ross Geller: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Joey Tribbiani: Phonetically?
Ross Geller: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Joey Tribbiani: Ok.
Ross Geller: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Joey Tribbiani: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Ross Geller: Wow. What does that mean?
Joey Tribbiani: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Ross Geller: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Joey Tribbiani: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Ross Geller: Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Joey Tribbiani: Come on! you...
Ross Geller: No!
