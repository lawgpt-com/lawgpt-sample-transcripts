Kathy: Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Joey Tribbiani: Is she great or what?
Kathy: So? Huh? What do you think?
Chandler Bing: Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Kathy: Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Chandler Bing: Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Kathy: Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Chandler Bing: Uhh, no-no thanks.
Kathy: Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Chandler Bing: Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Joey Tribbiani: I'll be right back. What was that?
Chandler Bing: What?
Joey Tribbiani: Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Chandler Bing: Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Joey Tribbiani: I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Chandler Bing: I am pretending.
Joey Tribbiani: Well then, do it better!
Chandler Bing: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Joey Tribbiani: Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
