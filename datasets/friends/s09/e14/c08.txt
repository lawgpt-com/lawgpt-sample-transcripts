Rachel Green: Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Steve: I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
Rachel Green: Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Steve: I'm kind of funny looking.
Rachel Green: What?
Steve: Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
Rachel Green: So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
Steve: I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
Rachel Green: Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
Steve: I lost it. To drugs.
Steve: I silk-screen t-shirts now.
Rachel Green: Really? What's that like?
Steve: It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
Rachel Green: Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
Steve: I do like my hair.
Rachel Green: Really?
