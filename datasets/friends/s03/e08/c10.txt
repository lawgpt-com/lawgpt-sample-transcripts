Ross Geller: Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Rachel Green: Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Ross Geller: It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Rachel Green: I did!
Ross Geller: I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Rachel Green: I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Ross Geller: Monica did it?

Ross Geller: Monica?
Monica Geller: Yeah.
Ross Geller: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Monica Geller: No. Why?
Ross Geller: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Monica Geller: Really?!
Ross Geller: Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Monica Geller: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Rachel Green: I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Monica Geller: You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Ross Geller: Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Rachel Green: I'll get the hat.
