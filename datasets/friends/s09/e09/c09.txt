Joey Tribbiani: What's going on?
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.
Joey Tribbiani: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, "Duh."
Monica Geller: Joey?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah?
Monica Geller: I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Chandler Bing: Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Joey Tribbiani: All right.
Monica Geller: You can go.
Chandler Bing: What?
Monica Geller: You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.
Chandler Bing: Really? You're gonna be okay?
Monica Geller: Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
Chandler Bing: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Monica Geller: It's gonna be so hot!
Chandler Bing: Okay, bye.
Monica Geller: Have fun.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks. Here's your ticket.
Chandler Bing: Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks man.
Joey Tribbiani: Where are you going?
Chandler Bing: Game's tomorrow night Joe.
