Monica Geller: Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
unknown: nan
Monica Geller: Oowww!!
Dressmaker: Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Emily Waltham: We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Monica Geller: You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Emily Waltham: I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Monica Geller: But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.

Monica Geller: Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
