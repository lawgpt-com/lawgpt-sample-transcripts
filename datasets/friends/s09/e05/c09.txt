Chandler Bing: Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Monica Geller: Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
Chandler Bing: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Monica Geller: No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Chandler Bing: Mean it?
Monica Geller: Yah.
Chandler Bing: You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
Monica Geller: D'you want to?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, let's celebrate life!
