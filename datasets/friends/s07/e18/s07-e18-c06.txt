Ross Geller: Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Joey Tribbiani: Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Ross Geller: There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Joey Tribbiani: Whoa!
Rachel Green: Whoa what?
Joey Tribbiani: Ross has a boyfriend.
Ross Geller: I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Rachel Green: Really?
Ross Geller: Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Rachel Green: Not right now.
Ross Geller: It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Rachel Green: Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Ross Geller: Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Rachel Green: Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani: How'd you get over that teacher?
Rachel Green: I didn't. I got under him.
Joey Tribbiani: Problem solved.
