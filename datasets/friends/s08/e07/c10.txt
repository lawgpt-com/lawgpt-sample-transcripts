Chandler Bing: Hi!
Monica Geller: Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
Chandler Bing: How come?
Monica Geller: Because I put my head between her legs.
Chandler Bing: To see her pants?
Monica Geller: They're my pants!
Chandler Bing: Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Monica Geller: No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Chandler Bing: God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Monica Geller: Fine. She's wearing my bra!
Chandler Bing: Oh dear God!
Monica Geller: My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Chandler Bing: And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
Monica Geller: Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Chandler Bing: Here's another plan...No!
Monica Geller: I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
Chandler Bing: Why?
Monica Geller: Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
Chandler Bing: I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Monica Geller: Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
Chandler Bing: You see that?
Monica Geller: Do you see this?
Chandler Bing: All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Monica Geller: Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
Chandler Bing: You need new clothes.
