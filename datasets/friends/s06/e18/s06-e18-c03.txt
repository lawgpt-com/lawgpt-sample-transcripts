Burt: Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Elizabeth Stevens: Professor Geller?
Ross Geller: Yeah?
Elizabeth Stevens: I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Ross Geller: Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Elizabeth Stevens: Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
Ross Geller: That was you?
Elizabeth Stevens: Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Ross Geller: Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Elizabeth Stevens: Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
Ross Geller: What time?
Elizabeth Stevens: Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Ross Geller: Gotcha.
Elizabeth Stevens: I'm kidding!
Ross Geller: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
