Monica Geller: Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Ross Geller: Let's give it a shot.
Monica Geller: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?

Ross Geller: Ohh, these are pretty good.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Ross Geller: Which one was that?
Monica Geller: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Ross Geller: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Ross Geller: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
