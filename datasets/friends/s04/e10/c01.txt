Ross Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Ross Geller: I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Phoebe Buffay: Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Ross Geller: 15? Your personal best!
Phoebe Buffay: Where were you?
Ross Geller: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.

Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, which museum?
Phoebe Buffay: No, answer his.
Ross Geller: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Chandler Bing: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Ross Geller: No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Chandler Bing: How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Joey Tribbiani: Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
