Chandler Bing: Good morning, everybody.
Intern: Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
Chandler Bing: Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
Intern: Seriously, you're an intern?
Chandler Bing: Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
Intern: Dude!
Chandler Bing: Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
Chandler Bing: The comedian? USO?!
Intern: Uhm, it's USA, sir.
