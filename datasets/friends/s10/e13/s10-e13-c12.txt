Ross Geller: Emma's down for the night.
Rachel Green: Oh, good.
Ross Geller: So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Rachel Green: Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Ross Geller: Oh, no problem.
Rachel Green: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Ross Geller: Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Rachel Green: It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Ross Geller: Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Rachel Green: Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Ross Geller: Oh, ye-ah!
Rachel Green: You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Ross Geller: ...Valentine's day...
Both: Oh yeah!
Rachel Green: Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Ross Geller: Hmmm-mmmm.
Rachel Green: Not even one more time?
Ross Geller: Not even once.
Rachel Green: No matter how much we want it.
Ross Geller: Even if we want it really bad.
Rachel Green: That's what we decided.
Ross Geller: Uhm, right!
Rachel Green: ...It's kinda hard though!
Ross Geller: Yeah.
Rachel Green: You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Ross Geller: ...I hate waste.
Rachel Green: ...Ross?
Ross Geller: Yes?
Rachel Green: Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Ross Geller: Damn it. It's never off the table.
