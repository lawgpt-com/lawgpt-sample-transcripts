Chandler Bing: What's the matter honey?
Monica Geller: I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Phoebe Buffay: It starts?
Rachel Green: Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Monica Geller: Okay!
Chandler Bing: Already?!
Rachel Green: Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Chandler Bing: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Rachel Green: Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Ross Geller: Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Monica Geller: Okay!
Chandler Bing: What in God's name is that?!
Ross Geller: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Monica Geller: This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Phoebe Buffay: That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
