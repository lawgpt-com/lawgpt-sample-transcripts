Nora Tyler Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Chandler Bing: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Nora Tyler Bing: Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Chandler Bing: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Nora Tyler Bing: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Chandler Bing: Really stupid.
Nora Tyler Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Chandler Bing: Yeah. No. No...

Ross Geller: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey Tribbiani: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Ross Geller: You're kidding.
Joey Tribbiani: No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Ross Geller: Wow!
Joey Tribbiani: Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
Ross Geller: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Joey Tribbiani: That makes more sense.
Ross Geller: So, what's going on now?
Joey Tribbiani: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Ross Geller: Whaddya see?
Joey Tribbiani: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
