Chandler Bing: Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Monica Geller: That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Chandler Bing: Hey, I've been honing!
Ross Geller: What was with the dishes?
Chandler Bing: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Monica Geller: Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Monica Geller: Great, now he's waving back.
Joey Tribbiani: Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica Geller: What kinda stuff?
Joey Tribbiani: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Phoebe Buffay: You cook naked?
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
