Ross Geller: This one?
Aunt Lillian: No.
Ross Geller: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Aunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Judy Geller: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Ross Geller: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Aunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes!

Ross Geller: Okay. Um, how about these?
Judy Geller: That's really a day shoe.
Ross Geller: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross Geller: Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Aunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy.
Judy Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross Geller: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.

Ross Geller: Oh my God..
Judy Geller: Is everything all right, dear?
Ross Geller: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
