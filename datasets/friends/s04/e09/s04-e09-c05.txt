Mr. Posner: You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Rachel Green: Thank you.
Joanna: Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Rachel Green: Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Mrs. Lynch: I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Rachel Green: Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Joanna: Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
Rachel Green: I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Joanna: Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Mr. Posner: Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Rachel Green: Yes, I realize that...
Joanna: And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Rachel Green: I love working with designers!
Joanna: With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
