Phoebe Buffay: Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Ross Geller: Looking up?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Monica Geller: Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Ross Geller: Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Ross Geller: That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Phoebe Buffay: That's what you think.
Monica Geller: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Phoebe Buffay: Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Monica Geller: What was her name?
Phoebe Buffay: Nesele Toulouse.
Monica Geller: Nestle Tollhouse?!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Phoebe Buffay: Yes!! Ohh.
Monica Geller: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe Buffay: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
