Judy Geller: Hi darling.
Monica Geller: So, what's this.
Ross Geller: Some of your old stuff.
Judy Geller: Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Monica Geller: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Ross Geller: Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Monica Geller: Oh, God forbid.
Judy Geller: Oh, hi Rachel.
Rachel Green: Hi.
Judy Geller: Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Rachel Green: Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Ross Geller: Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Rachel Green: What, what incident?
Ross Geller: Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
