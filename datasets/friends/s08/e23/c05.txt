Ross Geller: Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first.
Judy Geller: Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
Ross Geller: Oh good.
Judy Geller: I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Ross Geller: Okay, what's up?
Judy Geller: I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
Ross Geller: Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
Judy Geller: This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Ross Geller: Mom no, come on! Thank you.
Judy Geller: Just hear me out!
Ross Geller: N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
Judy Geller: Honestly! Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
Ross Geller: Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry...
Judy Geller: Just...think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
Ross Geller: Gimmie!
Rachel Green: Hi!
Judy Geller: Oh hi dear!
Rachel Green: Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
