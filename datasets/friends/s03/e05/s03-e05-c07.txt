Chandler Bing: All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Ross Geller: Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Chandler Bing: Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.

Ross Geller: And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Chandler Bing: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
