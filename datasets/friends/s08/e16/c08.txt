Monica Geller: I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Chandler Bing: Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Monica Geller: Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Chandler Bing: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Monica Geller: Jeez! What is with you?
Chandler Bing: I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
Monica Geller: All right, what's going on?
Chandler Bing: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Monica Geller: Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
Chandler Bing: No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
Monica Geller: I don't believe in soul mates either.
Chandler Bing: You don't?
Monica Geller: No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Chandler Bing: So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Monica Geller: No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
Chandler Bing: I love you.
Monica Geller: I know.
Chandler Bing: Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
