Chandler Bing: Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Monica Geller: No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Chandler Bing: OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Monica Geller: Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Chandler Bing: Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Monica Geller: Well, thanks.
Chandler Bing: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Monica Geller: Well, you know.
Chandler Bing: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Monica Geller: Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing: And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Monica Geller: Well no, but um.
Chandler Bing: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Monica Geller: Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Chandler Bing: So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Monica Geller: Alright.
Chandler Bing: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Monica Geller: OK. Just for a little while.
Chandler Bing: OK.
