Phoebe Buffay: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Alice Knight: Hi Frank.
Frank Buffay Jr.: Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Alice Knight: Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, but not just that.
Alice Knight: Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
Phoebe Buffay: None the less.
Alice Knight: None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
Phoebe Buffay: That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
