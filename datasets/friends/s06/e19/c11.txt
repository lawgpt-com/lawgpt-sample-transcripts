Rachel Green: Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah?
Rachel Green: I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.

#ALL#: No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Monica Geller: Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Chandler Bing: It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Rachel Green: Yeah, I'm good.
Phoebe Buffay: Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Patrick: Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Monica Geller: That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Chandler Bing: Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!

Rachel Green: No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Rachel Green: I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Eldad: I'm a little embarrassed.
Rachel Green: I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Phoebe Buffay: Then why did she ask us to...
Rachel Green: I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Eldad: Yes, Papaya Extract.
Rachel Green: Thank you!
