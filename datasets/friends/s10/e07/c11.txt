Mike Hannigan: You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
Mike Hannigan: Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.
Mike Hannigan: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
Phoebe Buffay: Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Mike Hannigan: Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
Phoebe Buffay: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
