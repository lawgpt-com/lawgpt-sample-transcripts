Phoebe Buffay: Hi Ginger.
Ross Geller: All right! I want my key back!
Phoebe Buffay: I don't have it!
Ross Geller: It's right there!
Phoebe Buffay: Ugh, okay Sherlock!
Ross Geller: Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Ross Geller: Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.

Ross Geller: Hi Whitney.
Whitney: Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Ross Geller: Yep. Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Ross Geller: Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Whitney: Sure.
Ross Geller: Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Phoebe Buffay: Watching ballroom dancing?
Ross Geller: Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Phoebe Buffay: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Ross Geller: Like what?
Phoebe Buffay: Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Ross Geller: Okay.
Phoebe Buffay: And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Ross Geller: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Phoebe Buffay: You're still gonna go out with her?!
Ross Geller: Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Ross Geller: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Phoebe Buffay: No listen to me! She is crazy!
Whitney: Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Phoebe Buffay: You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
