Phoebe Buffay: So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Ross Geller: Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
Phoebe Buffay: Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
Ross Geller: Uh, I'm going to take off.
Phoebe Buffay: All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
Ross Geller: What is it?
Phoebe Buffay: It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
Ross Geller: All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
Monica Geller: Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Monica, grow up!
Ross Geller: Hey, what's behind your back?
Monica Geller: Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Ross Geller: You don't want my opinion?
Monica Geller: Not really.
Ross Geller: Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
Monica Geller: All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
Ross Geller: The red one.
