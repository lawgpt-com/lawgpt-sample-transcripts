Ross Geller: Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Joey Tribbiani: Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Ross Geller: Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Joey Tribbiani: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Ross Geller: That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Ross Geller: Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah well we should order some food then.
Ross Geller: No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Joey Tribbiani: That sounds fair.
Ross Geller: Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Joey Tribbiani: Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Ross Geller: Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
Joey Tribbiani: All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Ross Geller: So let's decide on the spending limit...
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Ross Geller: I was thinking more like a hundred.
Joey Tribbiani: Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
