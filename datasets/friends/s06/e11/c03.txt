Janine Lecroix: How are we gonna get out of that one?
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Janine Lecroix: I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
Joey Tribbiani: What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Janine Lecroix: I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Joey Tribbiani: Blah?!
Janine Lecroix: Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Janine Lecroix: No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Joey Tribbiani: I guess.
Janine Lecroix: Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani: If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
