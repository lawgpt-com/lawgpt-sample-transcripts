Ross Geller: It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Chandler Bing: There you go! Someone came!
Ross Geller: Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
Monica Geller: Hi, glad you could come.
Chandler Bing: Please, come in.
Tom: Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
Chandler Bing: Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Tom: Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
Chandler Bing: At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
Ross Geller: Who is he?
Chandler Bing: Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Ross Geller: I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
Monica Geller: So, did you know Ross well?
Tom: Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
Monica Geller: Yes, he is. Me.
Tom: What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Chandler Bing: Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
Tom: Hey, listen. Call me.
Chandler Bing: Ok!
Ross Geller: I'm dead and no one cares?
Monica Geller: I look like a man??
Chandler Bing: Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Ross Geller: It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Chandler Bing: You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Ross Geller: Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Chandler Bing: Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Ross Geller: Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
Chandler Bing: I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
Kori: Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Chandler Bing: Kori? Kori Weston?
Kori: Yeah...
Chandler Bing: Wow! You look amazing!
Kori: And you are...
Chandler Bing: Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
Monica Geller: You are married though.
Chandler Bing: Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
Kori: I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Chandler Bing: I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Kori: We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Chandler Bing: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Kori: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Ross Geller: But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Kori: You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
Ross Geller: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
