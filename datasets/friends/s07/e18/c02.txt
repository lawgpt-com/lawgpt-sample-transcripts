Ross Geller: ...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
Lewis: What kinda noise?
Ross Geller: Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Lewis: But like how?
Ross Geller: Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Ned Morse: Yes sir.
Ross Geller: Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Ned Morse: Why?!
Ross Geller: Well you need 60% to pass...
Ned Morse: What'd I get?
Ross Geller: Seven.
Ned Morse: That's not so good.
Ross Geller: No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Ned Morse: Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
Ross Geller: Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Ned Morse: I'm in love with you.
Ross Geller: Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Ned Morse: You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Ross Geller: Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
