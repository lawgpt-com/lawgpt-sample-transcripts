Rachel Green: Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
Ross Geller: Right.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Ross Geller: No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Rachel Green: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Ross Geller: And smart!
Rachel Green: Popular.
Ross Geller: With an aptitude for science.
Phoebe Buffay: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Rachel Green: Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
Ross Geller: Really? Me too!
Phoebe Buffay: Me too!
Rachel Green: Really?!
Phoebe Buffay: Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Ross Geller: Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
Rachel Green: Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
Ross Geller: Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Rachel Green: Okay fine, what do you have?
Ross Geller: Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.
Rachel Green: Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, by Sandrine.
Ross Geller: You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Rachel Green: I'm really, really not.
Phoebe Buffay: How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Ross Geller: All right.
Rachel Green: All right.
Ross Geller: That sounds fair.
Rachel Green: Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
Ross Geller: Veto.
Rachel Green: Why?
Ross Geller: Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Phoebe Buffay: I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Ross Geller: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Rachel Green: Ross, why do you hate our child?
Ross Geller: Fine, you go.
Rachel Green: Okay, James.
Ross Geller: Huh.
Rachel Green: But only if it's a girl.
Ross Geller: Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Rachel Green: Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Ross Geller: Veto. Stewart?
Rachel Green: Veto. Sawyer?
Ross Geller: Veto. Helen?
Rachel Green: Veto.
Phoebe Buffay: Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
