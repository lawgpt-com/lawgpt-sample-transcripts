Chandler Bing: Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Monica Geller: No.
Chandler Bing: Why not?
Monica Geller: Bing's weird.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hey, you guys!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Monica Geller: Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Phoebe Buffay: Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Chandler Bing: Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, why not?
Chandler Bing: Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Phoebe Buffay: Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Chandler Bing: No reason, except...she...told...me.
Phoebe Buffay: Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Chandler Bing: No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Monica Geller: Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Phoebe Buffay: You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Monica Geller: Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Phoebe Buffay: Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Chandler Bing: Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
