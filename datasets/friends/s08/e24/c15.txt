Phoebe Buffay: Is she in there?
Ross Geller: Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh!
Ross Geller: Look at Emma!
Phoebe Buffay: I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Ross Geller: Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.

Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Ross Geller: It's...it's complicated okay?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Ross Geller: Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
Phoebe Buffay: I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Ross Geller: Yeah, exactly.
Phoebe Buffay: Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
