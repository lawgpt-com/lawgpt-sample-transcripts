Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hello!
Monica Geller: Hey, what's that?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.

Phoebe Buffay: Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Joey Tribbiani: Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Chandler Bing: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Ross Geller: Hey!
Gunther: Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Ross Geller: How come? Everybody else does.
Gunther: You can't.
Monica Geller: What is that?
Ross Geller: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Monica Geller: This is all of your things.
Ross Geller: Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Monica Geller: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Ross Geller: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Gunther: I'll take it all.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Ross Geller: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Chandler Bing: Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Ross Geller: After what I did? Can you blame her?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.

Joey Tribbiani: What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Monica Geller: Now calm down Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Chandler Bing: Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Monica Geller: Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Joey Tribbiani: No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
