Ross Geller: Here goes...
Rachel Green: I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Ross Geller: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
Sandy: Oh...
Ross Geller: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Rachel Green: YOU! You feel!
Ross Geller: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Rachel Green: Oh, damn you Geller!
Ross Geller: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Ross Geller: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
Sandy: What is it...? Please...?
Ross Geller: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Sandy: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
Ross Geller: Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Sandy: hmmm...
Ross Geller: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Rachel Green: Huh ha ha!
Ross Geller: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Sandy: That must have been hard.
Ross Geller: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
Sandy: But you are a real boy!
Ross Geller: I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Sandy: It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Ross Geller: Here come some more...
