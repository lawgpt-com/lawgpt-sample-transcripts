Monica Geller: Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Chandler Bing: Next time, can I say breathe?
Monica Geller: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Erica: No, I'm okay.
Monica Geller: Alright, I'll be right back.
Chandler Bing: Where are you going?
Monica Geller: To use the bathroom.
Chandler Bing: You can't leave me alone with her.
Monica Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Monica Geller: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Chandler Bing: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Monica Geller: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Chandler Bing: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Erica: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Chandler Bing: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Erica: What?
Chandler Bing: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
Chandler Bing: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
