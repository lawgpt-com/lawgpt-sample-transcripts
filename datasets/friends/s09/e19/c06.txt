Rachel Green: Hi!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Rachel Green: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Rachel Green: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Joey Tribbiani: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Rachel Green: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Rachel Green: Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Joey Tribbiani: Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Rachel Green: Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: I can't believe you married him.
Rachel Green: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Dr. Drake Ramoray: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
Rachel Green: It's over! You have to accept that.
Dr. Drake Ramoray: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
Rachel Green: Kiss me.
Joey Tribbiani: What?
Rachel Green: Kiss me.
Joey Tribbiani: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
Rachel Green: No, I'm saying...
Joey Tribbiani: but, but..
Rachel Green: just... don't talk...
