Rachel Green: Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.

Rachel Green: Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Rachel Green: I know.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Rachel Green: What's up Joe?
Joey Tribbiani: Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Rachel Green: Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani: ...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
Rachel Green: What are you saying?
Joey Tribbiani: I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Rachel Green: Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Joey Tribbiani: I'll treat you real nice.
Rachel Green: Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Joey Tribbiani: Won't-won't that take longer?
Rachel Green: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
