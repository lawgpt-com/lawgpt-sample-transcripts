Joey Tribbiani: Hello, Zelda.
Rachel Green: Who are you supposed to be?
Joey Tribbiani: The vicar!
Rachel Green: Do you even know what a vicar is?
Joey Tribbiani: Like a goalie, right?
Rachel Green: Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
Joey Tribbiani: All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Rachel Green: All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Joey Tribbiani: Huh?
Rachel Green: That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Joey Tribbiani: I-I-I-I did?
Rachel Green: Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Joey Tribbiani: This body?
Rachel Green: Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Rachel Green: Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Joey Tribbiani: I don't want to, I'm scared.
