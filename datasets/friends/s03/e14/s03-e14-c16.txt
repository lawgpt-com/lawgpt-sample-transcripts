Chandler Bing: No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Ginger: It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Chandler Bing: No. No. I don't think so.
Ginger: Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.

Ginger: What's that?
Chandler Bing: That's-that's my nubbin.

Chandler Bing: It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Ginger: You have three nipples?
Chandler Bing: Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Ginger: Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Chandler Bing: You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Ginger: Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
