Chandler Bing: Hi.
Monica Geller: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Monica Geller: What?!
Phoebe Buffay: Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Monica Geller: So, did you do it?
Chandler Bing: Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Monica Geller: Uh-oh, it was bad?
Chandler Bing: It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Monica Geller: Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Rachel Green: Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Chandler Bing: Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Monica Geller: All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Chandler Bing: Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Monica Geller: Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Chandler Bing: There are seven?!
Rachel Green: Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Chandler Bing: That's one?
Monica Geller: It's kind of an important one!
Chandler Bing: Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Rachel Green: Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Monica Geller: Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Chandler Bing: That-that's bad?
Rachel Green: Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Chandler Bing: Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Monica Geller: All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Rachel Green: Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Monica Geller: All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
