Monica Geller: Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Rachel Green: No.
Monica Geller: I really need to talk to you.
Rachel Green: Well, then talk!
Monica Geller: Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Rachel Green: Yes!
Ross Geller: What thing?
Monica Geller: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Ross Geller: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
Rachel Green: I'm gonna do it.
Monica Geller: All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Rachel Green: But I...
Monica Geller: Please!
Rachel Green: All right, fine.
