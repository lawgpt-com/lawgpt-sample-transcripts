Rachel Green: Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, you, too.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
Rachel Green: It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.

Joey Tribbiani: There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Phoebe Buffay: Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Joey Tribbiani: Thanks. But maybe later.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
Gunther: You want anything?
Joey Tribbiani: You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
Gunther: We have red bagels.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, okay.
