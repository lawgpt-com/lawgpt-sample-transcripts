Judy Geller: How's the hired help?
Monica Geller: Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Judy Geller: What's this? Blue nail polish?
Monica Geller: Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Judy Geller: Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Monica Geller: Let me ask you a question.
Judy Geller: Hmm.
Monica Geller: Why did you hire me?
Judy Geller: Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, I didn't hear that.
Monica Geller: Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Phoebe Buffay: Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
