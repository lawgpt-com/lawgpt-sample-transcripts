Monica Geller: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Chandler Bing: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Monica Geller: Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Chandler Bing: If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Monica Geller: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Chandler Bing: Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Monica Geller: Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Chandler Bing: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Monica Geller: Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
