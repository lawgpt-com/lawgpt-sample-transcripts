Ross Geller: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Charlie Wheeler: Did you get the grant?
Ross Geller: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Charlie Wheeler: What?
Ross Geller: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Charlie Wheeler: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Ross Geller: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
Charlie Wheeler: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
Ross Geller: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Charlie Wheeler: Seriously?
Ross Geller: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Charlie Wheeler: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
Ross Geller: Damnit!
