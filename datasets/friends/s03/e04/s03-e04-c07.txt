Ross Geller: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Rachel Green: G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey Tribbiani: G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross Geller: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Joey Tribbiani: Go Joe!!!
Phoebe Buffay: Helloo! Oh!
Joey Tribbiani: Pheebs! There you are!
Phoebe Buffay: No it's not, sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Joey Tribbiani: Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Phoebe Buffay: Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani: It's okay, these things happen.
Phoebe Buffay: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Joey Tribbiani: I'm, I'm okay. See.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Joey Tribbiani: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Phoebe Buffay: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Joey Tribbiani: They actually said that?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Joey Tribbiani: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Ross Geller: You'll never get me, Joe!!!
