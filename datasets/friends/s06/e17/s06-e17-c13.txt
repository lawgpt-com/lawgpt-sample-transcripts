The Instructor: Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.

Ross Geller: It's a great class.
The Instructor: Thanks.
Ross Geller: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
The Instructor: Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
Ross Geller: No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
The Instructor: Who? Me the attacker?
Ross Geller: Yes that's right.
The Instructor: Why?
Ross Geller: I tired attacking two women, did not work.
The Instructor: What?!
Ross Geller: No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
The Instructor: Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Ross Geller: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
