Chandler Bing: Phoebs, play with meeee.
Phoebe Buffay: No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Chandler Bing: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Phoebe Buffay: Why don't you play with your roommate?
Chandler Bing: Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Chandler Bing: No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Chandler Bing: We don't need to remedy that.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
Eddie Menuek: What was that?
Phoebe Buffay: Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Eddie Menuek: Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Chandler Bing: That was so lame.
Phoebe Buffay: I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Chandler Bing: So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
