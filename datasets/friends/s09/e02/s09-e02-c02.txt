Monica Geller: Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Phoebe Buffay: No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
Monica Geller: So sexy. Honey.
Chandler Bing: Yea yea.
Monica Geller: Honey why don't you go lie down.
Chandler Bing: No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
Joey Tribbiani: Why're you so tired?
Chandler Bing: Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
Joey Tribbiani: You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Rachel Green: Hi!
#ALL#: Hi, welcome home!
Monica Geller: Phoebe did the signs!
Rachel Green: Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Phoebe Buffay: Look at all the stuff people sent!
Rachel Green: Oh Ah! Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think... Oh you guys I love it.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey so where's Ross?
Rachel Green: He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Joey Tribbiani: Is he still mad at us?
Rachel Green: Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Joey Tribbiani: That's not fair! I can't do that.
Rachel Green: Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Joey Tribbiani: See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.
Chandler Bing: Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
