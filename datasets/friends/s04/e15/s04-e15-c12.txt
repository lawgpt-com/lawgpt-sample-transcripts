Phoebe Buffay: Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Ross Geller: Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, sure.
Ross Geller: No, not you.
Joey Tribbiani: Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.

Emily Waltham: You were amazing out there.
Ross Geller: Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Emily Waltham: Oh my God!
Ross Geller: I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Emily Waltham: You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Ross Geller: Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.

Ross Geller: No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
Emily Waltham: You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Ross Geller: It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
