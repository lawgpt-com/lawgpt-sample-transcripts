Ross Geller: That is so good! Do it again!
Joey Tribbiani: All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Chandler Bing: That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Ross Geller: No no, that's me.
Chandler Bing: Oh, yeah.
Ross Geller: Oh, hello.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Ross Geller: Is everything ok?
Phoebe Buffay: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Ross Geller: Oh my god.
Chandler Bing: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Monica Geller: Oh, honey.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Rachel Green: What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay: I think it went into me.
