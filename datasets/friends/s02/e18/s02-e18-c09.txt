Monica Geller: Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Rachel Green: Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Ross Geller: G'night.
Richard Burke: Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Monica Geller: Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Richard Burke: Two.
Monica Geller: Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Richard Burke: Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Monica Geller: Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Richard Burke: Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Monica Geller: Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Rachel Green: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Ross Geller: Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Rachel Green: Uhhhooo.
Ross Geller: C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Rachel Green: Well, there's you.
Ross Geller: Better not be doin' these in order.
Rachel Green: Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Ross Geller: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Rachel Green: Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Ross Geller: Really?
Rachel Green: Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
