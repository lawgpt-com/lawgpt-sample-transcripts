Monica Geller: Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Chandler Bing: You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Monica Geller: Thanks!
Chandler Bing: Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
unknown: nan
Monica Geller: Yeah right.
Chandler Bing: Why is that so funny?
Monica Geller: You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Chandler Bing: Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Monica Geller: Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Chandler Bing: Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Monica Geller: Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Joey Tribbiani: Hey!
Monica Geller: Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Joey Tribbiani: No, it's just my luggage.
unknown: nan
Chandler Bing: Hey!!
Joey Tribbiani: Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!

Ross Geller: Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Rachel Green: Hey!
Chandler Bing: Hey!
Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey, check out the hat!

Chandler Bing: What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Monica Geller: Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Rachel Green: Ross gave it to me.
Ross Geller: Yeah, I think she looks good.
Rachel Green: Ohh, thank you.
Chandler Bing: Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Rachel Green: Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Phoebe Buffay: And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
