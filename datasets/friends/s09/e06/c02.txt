Mike Hannigan: This is nice.
Phoebe Buffay: I know!
Mike Hannigan: You need both hands for that?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?
Joey Tribbiani: Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh.
Phoebe Buffay: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Mike Hannigan: Is it?
Phoebe Buffay: Maybe not, is it?
Mike Hannigan: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
Phoebe Buffay: I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Mike Hannigan: Oh, sorry.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Mike Hannigan: It's to my apartment.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Mike Hannigan: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, I want to.
Mike Hannigan: Oh, thank God.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
Mike Hannigan: Is this cool, huh?
Phoebe Buffay: It really is.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
